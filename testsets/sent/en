Scott County Sheriff Chris Holder reported that Timothy Manuel, 28, Bristol, Va., was ultimately found hiding behind a bush on Canoe Trail Drive.
“He presented a gun and they (police) gave him commands, ‘Put the gun down, put the gun down,’ ”
Holder told the Times News.
“He fired at the deputies and they returned fire.”
The daylong incident began with a suspected DUI traffic stop.
Holder said that in the Hiltons community, a deputy was nearly struck head-on by an erratic driver, then followed the vehicle.
The driver, later identified as Manuel, allegedly came to an abrupt stop on Roberts Creek Road.
Holder said Manuel threw his door open, jumped out, then reached back into the vehicle to retrieve a rifle.
Those aggressive actions reportedly spurred the deputy to fire his service weapon, with Manuel then running into an adjacent field.
According to Holder, Manuel knelt by a tree and aimed at the officer.
When the deputy took cover behind his squad car, Manuel fled into the woods.
Police from neighboring jurisdictions joined in the manhunt for Manuel.
A Virginia State Police helicopter also canvassed the area from above.
A search of Manuel’s abandoned vehicle reportedly uncovered more than a pound of meth and thousands of dollars in cash.
For several hours, officers continued to search the area surrounding where Manuel was last spotted.
Holder said that at about 5:40 p.m., a resident of nearby Canoe Trail Drive alerted deputies on his property and directed them toward a man he had spotted behind a bush.
As officers approached, Manuel reportedly ignored police commands and fired in their direction, spurring the fatal return fire of law enforcement.
Several agencies assisted in the manhunt, including the Russell and Washington County sheriff’s offices and Bristol Virginia Police Department.
Holder confirmed that the two officers who fatally shot Manuel are Scott County deputies.
As is protocol in officer-involved shootings, the incident will be reviewed by the VSP’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation.
“I hate that it happened. It’s a tragedy,” commented Holder.
“But my deputies and the other law enforcement are heroes. They’re heroes because they put their life on the line and put themselves in harm’s way to protect the community.”
Across the state line in Tennessee, records show Manuel is a felon who was convicted of robbery in Baltimore.
He was also previously housed at the Sullivan County jail on multiple charges, including reckless endangerment, aggravated assault, resisting arrest and possession of prohibited weapons.
Leeds United's Under-23s capped off a fine season by claiming the Professional Development League national title on Monday with a penalty shoot-out win over Birmingham City.
A crowd of almost 8,000 packed into Elland Road for the play-off final with plenty turned away at the turnstiles ahead of the Bank Holiday showdown.
Jack Clarke’s penalty won the tie after the game finished goalless at the end of extra-time.
Leeds were indebted to two saves from goalkeeper Kamil Miazek in the shoot-out.
United welcomed the Blues with bragging rights on the line as the pair locking horns for a third time this season.
Carlos Corberan selected a strong line-up for the clash, including 19-goal striker Ryan Edmondson.
Leeds dominated early proceedings but were kept largely at bay by the visitors in the first half.
Jack Clarke went close as did Ryan Edmondson but the game remained goalless at the half-time whistle.
United, though, started the second half with a spring in their step as the crowd rallied them on.
Pascal Struijk powered a header goalwards from a Mateusz Bogusz free-kick but Zack Jeacock was equal to it in the visiting goal.
United pushed on but it was City who looked the likelier of the two teams as full-time approached.
Substitute Olly McCoy forced Miazek into action before Jamie Shackleton produced a fine last-ditch tackle to deny the winger just moments later.
The two sides failed to be separated as United entered extra-time for the second game running in the play-offs.
It was a tight affair but City full-back Remeao Hutton almost broke the deadlock with a thunderous effort which smashed against Miazek's crossbar.
Bogusz then returned the favour as his free-kick left Jeacock rooted to the spot at the ball cannoned off a post.
Edmondson was on hand to tap in the rebound from close-range but the linesman's flag was raised to cut short the celebrations.
Penalties were needed and Birmingham took an immediate advantage when Bogusz struck the woodwork but Miazek saved from Joe Redmond and Caolon Boyd-Munce to hand Clarke the chance to seal it.
The winger powered home from 12-yards to spark wild celebrations as United were crowned PDL champions.
Friday night on Oct. 5, 2017, Alexandria Wright, in a quiet voice on the phone, told her mother, Lori Wright, that she would be home in about 30 minutes.
“No,” Lori Wright answered between sobs when asked if she ever heard from her daughter again.
Wright testified she waited half an hour then began calling and texting both her daughter and Venus resident Phillip Campbell numerous times.
Wright said she continued attempting to reach both through the next day and was en route to Campbell’s home when Burleson police contacted her about her daughter.
Testimony began today in the 413th District Court in Campbell’s murder trial.
Burleson police responded to an injured person call Oct. 6, 2017, at Days Inn at 3229 S. Burleson Blvd. to find Alexandria Wright deceased.
Campbell, who was in the room when police arrived , said he attempted CPR on Wright and needed an attorney, according to reports.
Officials later determined that Wright died of strangulation and arrested Campbell on charges of murder and tampering with evidence.
Lori Wright testified that her daughter never responded to another phone call or text message after saying she would be home in half an hour but added that Campbell did respond to several of her text messages to his phone.
Johnson County Assistant District Attorney Ryan Eady displayed screenshots of text messages sent from Wright to Campbell’s phone.
Campbell at one point responds that he doesn’t know where Alexandria is.
When Wright in a subsequent text threatens to notify the authorities, Campbell responds that he’s in Fort Worth.
Hotel receipts entered into evidence show that Campbell rented a room at Days Inn in Burleson from Oct. 5-6 and again from Oct. 6-7, paying in cash both times.
The phone number listed on the receipts matches Campbell’s cellphone number.
Wright, in another text, asked Campbell when her daughter left him but said Campbell never responded after that.
Wright said Alexandria Wright, 26, lived in Saginaw with her father, her boyfriend and her 8-year-old daughter.
Wright said she saw Alexandria Wright at her home in Saginaw earlier the day of Oct. 5 and that Alexandria Wright told her she was having problems with her boyfriend, Randy, who had stolen her car payment money.
Wright said Alexandria Wright asked her for $300, but she did not have it.
Wright testified that Campbell is a friend of one of Alexandria Wright’s former boyfriends and that Alexandria Wright told her that he had agreed to loan or give her $300.
Wright said she knew her daughter was going to Burleson to meet Campbell later that day but had no idea they went to Days Inn until after she learned her daughter had been killed.
Shwetaben Patel, who worked the front desk at Days Inn on the nights of Oct. 5-6, testified that Campbell checked in, produced identification and paid cash.
Patel added that a girl was with him the first night he checked in.
Patel testified that on the night of Oct. 6 Campbell came to the front desk and asked her to call 911.
“I told him you can call from your room but he said the phone wasn’t working,” Patel said.
“I called but told him to stay there in case dispatch needed to talk to him but he walked away.”
Eady played Patel’s call to 911 during which Patel tries to transfer the Burleson police dispatcher to Campbell’s room without success.
Burleson Police Officer Brandon Rousseau testified that he was first on scene followed closely behind by MedStar paramedics.
“I got a call about possibly an injured person in Room 212 with not a lot of info to go on,” Rousseau said.
Rousseau testified that Campbell opened the door.
“He said, ‘I did everything I could. I tried. Nothing’s working,’ and statements like that,” Rousseau said.
“I didn’t see anyone else in the room at the time.”
Rousseau said he noticed the room was in disarray with papers scattered, the mattress of one of the beds “kind of off the bed” and noticed the odor of marijuana.
” Rousseau said it caught his attention when Campbell said he tried CPR.
“I looked then toward the side of the room and noticed there was a leg sticking out of the sheets,” Rousseau said.
Testimony began Thursday in the 413th District Court in the murder trial of Phillip Campbell, right, pictured with his attorney, Don Bonner.
Matt Smith/CTR Paramedics checked and confirmed that Alexandria Wright was deceased at which point Rousseau detained Campbell.
“He seemed upset, kind of sad but no emotion other than that,” Rousseau said when asked about Campbell’s demeanor.
“He appeared to be intoxicated on something, some other substance than alcohol.”
Rousseau testified that he saw blood on the bedsheets near Wright’s head.
Burleson Officer Marque Jones said he arrived a short time later and led Campbell, who was cuffed, to his squad car.
Marque said that Campbell, while he was being led to the squad car, said he tried CPR and needed a lawyer.
“I didn’t know if he was talking to me or himself,”Jones said.
“I didn’t ask or say anything to him.”
MedStar paramedic Mike McCarty testified that Wright was dead when he arrived on scene and had been for some time.
Both Burleson officers and McCarty testified that Campbell, while he was in Jones’ car complained of chest pain and was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital before being taken to the Johnson County Jail.
McCarty said Campbell appeared disoriented in the back of Jones’ car.
McCarty said Campbell said he was light headed and dizzy and said he had had ice methamphetamine, marijuana and whiskey.
Lori Wright testified that Alexandria Wright had trouble with marijuana and methamphetamine but that she did not know nor have any reason to believe her daughter engaged in prostitution.
Campbell is free on bond.
His Thursday wanderings during breaks in testimony raised concerns among prosecutors and District Judge Bill Bosworth.
“They’re saying your client goes out and talks to people during breaks,” Bosworth told Campbell’s attorney Don Bonner. “I have no idea what he talks to them about but he needs to stay in the courtroom unless he has permission to go out in the hallway.”
From staff and wire reports ASHLAND - An Ashland cardiologist convicted of health care fraud has been sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay $1 million in restitution.
Dr. Richard Paulus appeared before U.S. District Judge David Bunning on Thursday for sentencing and continued to maintain his innocence in the case, The Associated Press reported.
In October 2016, a federal jury convicted Paulus, 71, of one count of health care fraud and 10 counts of making false statements relating to health care matters after hearing evidence showing that he defrauded Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers by implanting medically unnecessary stents in his patients and falsifying the degree of stenosis on their medical records.
After the trial, the district court granted Paulus' motion for an acquittal after a federal judge ruled prosecutors didn't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Paulus had " acted with fraudulent intent," but the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed that decision in 2018 and reinstated Paulus' conviction.
According to evidence presented at trial, from 2008 to 2013, Paulus performed invasive heart procedures on patients who did not need them while working at King's Daughters Medical Center in Ashland.
From 2006 to 2012, Paulus billed Medicaid for more heart procedures than any other cardiologist in Kentucky, and was fifth in the nation in terms of amount paid by Medicaid for stent procedures.
Paulus' sentence was based on stents he placed in 71 patients whose blockages were significantly less than 70% - where Paulus had recorded them at or near in order to be paid for the procedures.
Paulus was paid based on productivity by King's Daughters Medical Center, receiving about $9.4 million from 2009-12.
From 2006 through 2012, King's Daughters Medical Center was paid more than $30 million for cardiac stents performed by Paulus, according to court records.
In May 2014, King's Daughters Medical Center agreed to pay the federal government $40.9 million to resolve civil allegations that it made millions of dollars by falsely billing federal health care programs for performing medically unnecessary heart procedures.
The hospital did not admit any wrongdoing.
Under federal law, Paulus must serve 85% of his prison sentence and will be under the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for three years following his release.
Defense Attorney Bob Bennett said he was disappointed in the sentence and will appeal.

He prowled into the French class at UCLA like a GQ model fresh from a photo shoot.
Tall, slender, elegantly yet casually dressed, with tousled brown hair and sleepy hazel eyes under exquisite dark brows, he paused gracefully in front of the room.
The hum of pre-class conversation faltered as all eyes turned.
He glanced unhurriedly around and came to sit next to me.
He introduced himself.
He looked to be in his mid-20s.
Bewitched by his perfect smile, I didn’t hear what he said.
The instructor, a no-nonsense Parisienne renowned for her brusque style, narrowed her eyes at him from the front of the room.
He turned his brilliant smile on her and she dropped her attendance sheet, a blush mottling her dry cheeks.
I didn’t learn much French in that class, but I did learn something about male perfection.
I went home that night to my bungalow off a dilapidated communal courtyard in Venice and announced to my neighbors, “I’ve met Mr. Perfect!” “Wow, what’s his name?”
I had to admit I didn’t know.
A Northern Californian, I had divorced and fled to Los Angeles a year earlier to channel my sorrows into school.
I was in my 30s but looked younger.
I hadn’t dated since the divorce.
Over the course of the class, we’d become friendly acquaintances.
On the last night, he asked for my phone number and asked me out.
I arrived home and told my neighbors, “I have a date with Mr. Perfect!”
Cries of encouragement greeted my announcement, though I thought I detected some raised eyebrows.
When I’d told Mr. Perfect I lived in Venice, he’d sounded mildly impressed.
“On the canals?” he asked.
“Well, no,” I admitted, “Closer to Lincoln Boulevard actually.”
When he arrived, I proudly showed him my beloved but admittedly run-down bungalow, outfitted with thrift shop furniture.
A leafy vine leaped exuberantly through a crack in the ceiling.
Mr. Perfect’s smile seemed a bit strained as he hurried me out to his car, a gray Peugeot convertible.
We drove to the beach.
The car’s top was down, and soft spring air flowed through my hair as we drove west on Venice.
Walking through the sand at the beach, we stopped as the sun slid down over the horizon.
I was startled when I felt his arm drape casually over my shoulders.
He leaned down to kiss me.
A few astonishing minutes later, he pulled away and wrapped his arm around me as we walked back to the car.
I settled into my seat and considered a lighthearted comment to ease the moment, but he was intent on extricating his car unscratched from the lot.
We drove to a small elegant restaurant on Abbot Kinney.
Over mushroom risotto and Pinot Gris, Mr. Perfect told me about himself.
His family lived in Bel-Air.
He had gone to an Ivy League college.
He had an unspecified position with his family’s corporation.
He had been regarded as a wild child for unnamed foibles during college, but now his family looked forward to him settling down and taking the reins of responsibility.
Listening to his tales of a world completely alien to me, I tried to ignore the small voice in the back of my mind whispering that he was too beautiful, too rich and much too young for me.
He smiled at me as the waiter brought more wine, and my heart fluttered.
Was he finally going to ask me about myself?
I was mentally recalibrating references to my past experiences to reflect my fictitiously younger age when he leaned toward me, took and kissed my hand, and murmured, “Why don’t you have those wood floors in your bungalow replaced? They’re warped.”
I laughed out loud.
“I can barely manage the rent!”
He leaned back, letting go of my hand.
“You rent that place?”
Conversation lagged as we ended the meal and he drove me home.
He walked me to my doorstep just as my neighbor’s friendly cat whisked past me to vomit inside.
I made a joke about binging and purging.
Mr. Perfect said in a gentlemanly tone that he wouldn't be coming in.
I walked with him back out to the street, in time to catch some local kids trying to remove his hubcaps.
He froze.
I shouted at them; they scattered.
Mr. Perfect, his beautiful face pale, leaped into his car and sped away.
The next day, my courtyard friends demanded details.
“Perfect,” I lied.
“He said he’ll call me.”
“No more perfect men for me,” I announced when it became all too obvious that he’d never call.
A few weeks later, a friend invited me to a party: “I want you to meet my cousin,” she’d said.
(I didn’t want to go, but it would get me away from my silent answering machine. Yes, this was 30 years ago, when answering machines were the thing.)
Her cousin was shorter than me, with a mop of dark curls.
I had gone to the party feeling like I’d never laugh again, but he had me guffawing 10 minutes in.
I stayed late at the party.
The next day, I came home from class to find my answering machine blinking.
He kept calling and kept making me laugh.
He drove an old BMW.
Some neighborhood kids tried to steal his hubcaps, too, but he took it in stride.
We were married the following year and had three daughters.
They make me laugh too.
New York State had achieved the highest percentage of residents with health insurance coverage of the four most populous states in the country by 2017, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the nation's leading health research organizations.
Ninety-four percent of New York's residents had health insurance coverage that year; California was second, with 93%.
Both of these states accepted the Obamacare Medicaid Expansion, and both had 26% of their populations served by Medicaid in 2017.
Texas and Florida, the other two of the four most populous states, both rejected the Medicaid expansion and had 83% insured and 87% insured, respectively.
The United States as a whole had achieved 91% of its population covered by health insurance by 2017.
A report by State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli actually pegged New York's health insurance coverage rate even higher in January 2018, at 95%, citing Center for Disease Control data.
Either number for New York, 94 or 95%, reflects a solid record of attainment of social well-being in the state; not perfect, by any means, but very good.
So how did New York get there?
This article looks at how New York's policies achieved these positive results, as well as prospects for improvement.
First, however, it's useful to take a look at the immediate pre-Obamacare environment for the nation and these most-populous states, as well as how the states and the nation were faring in 1998-2000 as the Clinton administration came to a close in a period of substantial economic growth.
The following tables look at health coverage in the United States and the four big states in 2008 and 2010, as the Great Recession was beginning and ending.
In 2008, 15% of the nation's residents did not have health insurance and 13% were in the Medicaid program.
In New York, 12% of residents were uninsured and 13% of residents were on Medicaid.
By 2010, after the Great Recession, the uninsured had risen to 16% of the country, and 17% on Medicaid.
In New York, uninsured was still 12%, but 22% were on Medicaid.
A 2001 U.S. Census Bureau report showed uninsured rates for 1998-2000.
As the American economy continued to expand at the end of the Bill Clinton years, health insurance coverage reached 14% uninsured by 2000.
New York's situation was worse than the nation in 1998-2000, with 15.7% of its residents uninsured in 1998, and 15.1% uninsured in 2000.
In 2000, California had 17.9% uninsured, Texas 23.2%, and Florida, 17.2%.
New York, at 15% uninsured, had a higher percentage of its residents with health insurance of the four largest states, but all four had higher levels of uninsured than the nation.
What happened?
First: the Defeat of Block Grants for Medicaid After the Republican Party won the House and Senate in 1994, the new Republican majorities passed legislation to limit Medicaid spending by providing a capped lump-sum amount of money for Medicaid to every state in the country, effectively eliminating the program as an entitlement.
This lump sum was called a Block Grant.
Initially, welfare and other spending for poor people would also be given to states as a block grant.
President Clinton vetoed this entire package in December 1995.
New York Governor George Pataki made similar proposals, which were rejected by the Democratic-controlled Assembly.
Ultimately, Clinton was able to force Congress to separate Medicaid from welfare, with welfare becoming the "Temporary Assistance to Needy Families" block grant (in New York), while Medicaid health care was preserved as an entitlement for the poor.
Enter Child Health Plus and Family Health Plus In 1997, President Clinton proposed and Congress approved a program to expand health insurance coverage for children up to age 19.
In 1999, the New York State Legislature passed legislation, which Governor Pataki signed, authorizing New York to apply for approval from the federal government for a program to be named Family Health Plus, enrolling the parents of children in Child Health Plus (CHP), up to 150% of the poverty level, in the Medicaid program.
Childless adults earning up to 100% of the poverty level would also be permitted to enroll.
CHP in New York had enrolled over 500,000 children by 2001, and the federal government approved the Family Health Plus waiver.
Implementation was planned for the fall of 2001.
A Health Emergency is Declared in New York After 9/11 The horrific impacts of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and New York are known as part of American history.
But there was a side story about health care in New York that is less well-known.
The New York State government's Medicaid computers were in the World Trade Center and were destroyed in the attacks.
These computers contained the information on the eligibility of those enrolled in the Medicaid program.
Medicaid was very bureaucratic; recipients had to submit proof of their continued eligibility every year in a recertification process.
After the Medicaid computers were destroyed, Governor Pataki announced on September 19, 2001 that New York had received an emergency waiver of the recertification requirements for Medicaid for New York City only through January 31, 2002.
A program known as Disaster Relief Medicaid was implemented that allowed persons to merely fill out a one-page document and attest they were eligible for Medicaid -- 350,000 people enrolled by the deadline. New York's Family Health Plus program began its implementation shortly after 9/11 as well, allowing adults with children and earning up to 150% of the poverty line to enroll in Medicaid. A national recession was underway at the time of the 9/11 attack -- exacerbated in New York, of course, by the devastation in downtown Manhattan.
New York State lost nearly 200,000 jobs between August 2001 and August 2003, heavily concentrated in New York City.
The confluence of all these events resulted in a major expansion of the Medicaid program in New York State; enrollment rose from 2.7 million in 2000 to 3.9 million in 2004.
New York State also began subsidizing small-group private health insurance through a program known as Healthy New York, where subsidized enrollment reached 145,000.
Sri Lanka's police have released the names of the nine people who are allegedly responsible for the Easter Sunday suicide bombings that killed 253 people.
Sri Lankan authorities said the attackers' assets would be seized in accordance with anti-terror legislation.
Police spokesperson Ruwan Gunasekera confirmed today that two brothers from an affluent Colombo family were responsible for the attacks on two luxury hotels.
One brother, Ilham Ahmed Mohamed Ibrahim, was identified as one of the suicide bombers who targeted Colombo's Shangri-La Hotel.
The second brother, Inshaf Ahmed, was responsible for the bombing of the neighbouring Cinnamon Grand Hotel.
The second suicide bomber responsible for the attack on the Shangri-La was named as Zahran Hashim.
The Guardian reports Hashim headed the local jihadist group responsible for the attacks, subsequently claimed by Islamic State (IS).
Hashim also had a leadership role in the now prohibited National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ).
The man who bombed the third hotel, the Kingsbury, was identified as Mohamed Azzam Mubarak Mohamed.
Police spokesperson Gunasekera confirmed Mohamed's wife was in police custody.
A local resident, Ahmed Muaz, targeted St Anthony's church.
His brother has been arrested.
Mohamed Hasthun was identified as the bomber of St Sebastian church.
The Guardian reports that Hasthun and Hashim lived in close proximity to one another.
Local resident Mohamed Nasser Mohamed Asad was identified as the bomber of the Christian Zion church in Batticaloa.
Another attacker who failed to detonate a bomb at a separate luxury hotel was named as Abdul Latheef.
Latheef went on to set off his explosives at a guest house close to Colombo.
The Guardian reports that Latheef had studied in Australia and Britain.
Following the hotel bomb attacks, the wife of Ilham Ahmed Mohamed Ibrahim, Fathima Ilham, detonated explosives strapped to her body.
The blast killed her two young children and three police officers who were present at the Colombo home.
-- A Grand Rapids man who told investigators he empathized with mass killers is charged with lying about renting an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle in violation of a judge's order.
The 24-year-old recently appeared in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids on the charge -- one count of making a false statement to a federal officer.
MLive/The Grand Rapids Press is not naming the man at this time because he hasn't been arraigned on the charge, which carries up to five years in federal prison.
The following narrative is from federal agents in the criminal complaint supporting the charge: Investigators had on-and-off contact with the man ever since he was denied entry into Canada on Aug. 29, 2018 for not presenting his U.S. Passport.
Border agents found the man had notes on constructing remotely-detonated explosive devices and, after a search of his laptop, found he had conducted "a pattern of repeated searches" related to mass killers, their victims and how to construct explosive devices.
Asked by agents about his views mass killings, the man stated "although he felt sympathy for victims of such events, he also felt empathy for people who committed such acts because they must have their reasons and he felt isolated and maligned by society."
He described himself as friendless and stated "he typically spent his days in his room with the blinds drawn surfing the internet."
He told agents he had construction two remote-activation devices in his bedroom at his aunt's house.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation then opened an investigation into potential bomb-related offenses and searched his bedroom the following day, finding partially-constructed bomb triggering devices that appeared to be built following instructions from an online Al Qaeda publication.
About a month later, in early October, the man attempted to buy a pistol in Grand Rapids.
The sale was delayed after a background check because of the FBI's open investigation.
Investigators interviewed him the day after the attempted purchase, asking why he wanted to buy a firearm.
He told them he " wanted to acquire one because he did not want to feel that he was inferior to people that did own firearms, and that if he had obtained one he would have buried it in his aunt's backyard."
He again expressed to investigators he felt isolated and left out, "that everyone else has a life and he does not."
In February, he attempted twice more to purchase a handgun.
He was again delayed when retailers ran background checks.
Agents followed up about a week later, and the man told them he wanted a gun for self-defense and to protect his aunt's home.
He also said he spends too much time on the computer "watching people live their lives," and that he feels unable to live a normal life.
When talking about mass shooters, agents noted he went from "despondent" to "happy and animated." "He stated that he gets excited reading about mass shootings, and that this is why he spends significant time online searching out stories about mass shooters, their families, and the victims and victims' families," the complaint states.
(He) expressed the view that mass shooters are likely angry, and that they feel stuck in their lives and jealous of other people.
He promised agents, at their request, he wouldn't purchase a handgun and would instead see psychologist.
About a week later he purchased a handgun, telling agents he got tired of renting a gun to shoot.
He voluntarily surrendered his gun to agents.
They later petitioned him for mental health services.
While hospitalized, his caseworker noted "(he) has been struggling with depression, hopelessness and thoughts of hurting others" and should remain hospitalized.
He was released from hospitalization on March 21 on court order to continue outpatient treatment, take his medications and not possess a firearm.
The court found he presented a "substantial risk" of harm to himself and others.
On April 17 he traveled to an Ann Arbor gun range and store where he rented an AR-15 and paid for a lesson on how to use it.
FBI agents learned about this while he was there and told employees he was on a mental-health order barring him from using firearms.
Employees made up an excuse to cut his range time short, and he left with plans to come back later.
He went to a different gun store where he inquired about ammunition used by the AR-15.
He then traveled into Ohio and stayed the night near another gun store with a range.
Michigan State Troopers picked him up on April 19 on a detainment order for violating the court order.
He had a notebook with him that detailed directions and contacts of several gun stores in Ann Arbor and Toledo, Ohio.
... (His) escalating conduct indicated that he was a public safety threat, an agent wrote.
When asked why he traveled the state to go to gun stores and what he did there, he denied handling or firing any guns.
His next court appearance is scheduled for May 8.
A tenant has been awarded $9280 in compensation and damages by the Tenancy Tribunal after his landlord failed to repair a hole in a bedroom floor of the house he rented for two years.
The tenant, Philip John Douglas Templeton-Knight, claimed the hole in the floor of the main bedroom of the two-bedroom cottage in Dairy Flat, north Auckland, was big enough for his cat to crawl through from underneath the house, according to the tribunal decision.
Photos he presented at the tribunal hearing showed there were myriad other health and safety issues at the property – a ranch slider door in the main bedroom had never closed properly, windows were missing latches and could be opened from the outside and live wiring was exposed in two places.
Templeton-Knight told the tribunal when it rained water flowed through a gap in the bedroom sliding door and that dampness had caused the floor to rot and created the hole, which made the room cold and "uninhabitable" for most of the tenancy.
A tenant has been awarded $9280 in compensation and damages by the Tenancy Tribunal after his landlord failed to repair a hole in a bedroom floor of a house he rented for two years.
The hole grew larger as the floor decayed, he said, and the carpet was damp and mouldy.
Templeton-Knight paid $280 per week to sublet the cottage from Susan Lynnette Burdett, who lived in a separate three-bedroom house on the same property which she rented from the owner of both houses.
He said he had asked Burdett to solve the issues seven times between 2015 and 2017 and showed the tribunal three documents requesting repairs to doors, locks and latches, carpet and the hole in the main bedroom floor.
The tribunal heard the hole in the floor had been there before Templeton-Knight moved in and he had told Burdett about it during the first inspection.
However, Burdett said the hole in the bedroom floor was only an issue for four to six months.
She presented the tribunal with an inspection report dated January 2017 which referred to the cottage as being in "satisfactory overall condition", but noted a leak in the ceiling and a hole in the floor needed fixing.
The adjudicator decided the photographic and other evidence contradicted the claim the cottage was in "satisfactory overall condition" and that Burdett had acted unlawfully by failing to ensure the cottage was in a reasonable state of repair.
The holes in the ceiling and the floor were only fixed near the end of the tenancy in 2017 and Burdett had never resolved the issues with the live electrical cabling and leaking doors, according to the tribunal decision.
The adjudicator ordered Burdett to pay Templeton-Knight $7780 in compensation and another $1500 in damages.
The dispute had taken more than two years to settle.
Both parties had lodged applications with the tribunal in 2017.
Templeton-Knight wanted his rent reimbursed.
Burdett wanted to evict Templeton-Knight.
A hearing that April was adjourned after Templeton-Knight argued Burdett should refund all of the rent he'd paid because the tenancy was illegal.
At the most recent hearing on April 1 2019, Templeton-Knight presented a building permit from 1978 which approved the construction of a six-by-nine metre garage or workshop.
It was not clear when the building was converted into a cottage, but a letter from Auckland Council from 2017 confirmed no consents appeared to have been issued for the work.
Burdett said she hadn't realised the cottage lacked the right consents because it had been used as accommodation before she moved into the three-bedroom house in 2005.
The adjudicator found there wasn't enough evidence to show the tenancy was illegal.
Military veterans stripped of medals and discharged from the armed forces for their sexuality could have their honours returned as a bisexual Falklands sailor launches legal bid.
Joe Ousalice, 68, served for nearly 18 years in the Royal Navy but was discharged in 1993 prior to the lifting of the ban on LGBT people serving in the armed forces.
The Falklands veteran is taking action against the Ministry of Defence to have his Long Service and Good Conduct (LS&GC) medal returned after it was cut off his uniform following a Court Martial.
An MoD spokesperson said it would be inappropriate to comment as legal proceedings are ongoing, but added, “we are currently looking at how personnel discharged from service because of their sexuality, or now abolished sexual offences, can have their medals returned.”
Mr Ousalice, a former radio operator, served in the Falklands War in which he lost two comrades, did six tours of duty in Northern Ireland and was also posted to conflict zones in the Middle East.
I loved life in the navy, because of the comradeship, he told the BBC.
It was my life.
His work was praised by his seniors and he was awarded the LS&GC medal in 1991.
Royal Navy regulations stipulate that LS&GC recipients must have served a minimum of 15 years continuous good conduct.
It can be removed for later poor conduct.
However, Mr Ousalice said he knew when he joined up that he would have to hide the fact that he was bisexual.
It was a double life I was living,” he said. “I was watching every day what I was saying, what I was doing.
He says that when ashore he never visited gay pubs and on board ship he didn't associate with sailors who he knew were gay.
I knew if I did I would have the SIB (Special Investigation Branch) on my back doing covert operations, shadowing me with cameras, taking photographs of what I was getting up to.
Cleared at Court Martial of assaulting another sailor in the early 1990s, he was found guilty of being in bed with the other man - something he has always denied - and was dismissed on the grounds that his conduct was prejudicial to good order and naval discipline.
An officer wrote: "He may attempt to corrupt others in the future", adding that "the needs of the service must come first".
Although not official policy at the time, but not unheard of, Mr Ousalice had his LS&GC medal cut off his uniform following the verdict and hopes that the lifting of the ban on LGBT people in the armed forces in 2000 would help him to have his medal returned.
The Telegraph understands that the MoD does not keep records of such matters.
Amendments to the Policing and Crime Bill for England and Wales in 2017 allowed thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted of now abolished sexual offences to be posthumously pardoned.
The new ruling became widely known as the Turing Law, after The provision is named Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker and computing pioneer, who was convicted of gross indecency in 1952.
Turing received a royal pardon (posthumously) in 2013.
The Turing Law could see military veterans who were previously denied medals have them awarded.
The Telegraph understands that no medals have been returned yet or awarded in the wake of the government’s implementation of the Turing Law and that work is still ongoing in the MoD.
Any military veteran is able to apply to the MoD Medals Office, the department based at Imjin Barracks in Gloucester responsible for issuing medals to currently serving members of the armed forces, veterans and MOD employees.
The Medals Office says that individuals should only wear official decorations, medals or emblems to which they are entitled and which have been approved for acceptance and wear.
Unofficial medals should not be worn with official orders, decorations and other medals.
It is common practice for the next of kin of a deceased service person to wear their relative’s decorations and medals as a mark of remembrance.
It is custom to wear such medals on the right breast in civilian dress only.
The MoD says official approval is not required to wear a relative’s medals, although current serving personnel should not wear relative’s medals or unofficial medals whilst in uniform.
The Rev. Joy Powell says she was “raped, railroaded and bamboozled” by police.
Her crime?
Being a poor black woman who faced off against the police—protesting their violent brutality against black people in Rochester, NY.
Once she defied them, she was warned, then targeted and framed for serious crimes.
A few weeks ago, Australian Julian Assange was forcibly dragged from his political asylum to face the American police state.
His crime?
Like Rev. Powell, he dared to tell the truth about the violence and brutality that defines the American state.
Scottish political analyst Jon Wight, citing the treatment of American political prisoners Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu Jamal, calls the US “justice” system the “most cruel and callous in the world.”
That system does not tolerate the exposure of its war crimes and abuses of its police state quietly—it retaliates against those who expose its injustice by treating them to cruel and callous punishment.
Black women who have confronted the abuses of America’s white authority have suffered its punishment throughout our history.
Anarchist Lucy Parsons, born in 1853, is one of the few black women mentioned in labor histories, usually as the wife of the martyred Albert Parsons, who was executed in the wake of Chicago’s Haymarket Riot of 1886.
Parsons was a dedicated “revolutionist” for labor’s cause, leading rallies and making speeches in 43 states, advocating the use of explosives by tramps and their taking a “few rich people with them.”
She was constantly arrested, roughly handled, and jailed: in 1913, at age 60, she was stripped and jailed in Chicago for “peddling literature without a license.”
Another labor radical, Claudia Jones, who headed the Women’s Commission for the US Communist Party, was jailed in 1955.
She fought the “madam-maid” relationship of white to black women, and felt socialism was the only hope for American blacks.
Jones was deported to England where she continued to work for socialism.
Women who joined the struggle against American racism in the 1960s and 70s met particularly violent reprisals from their government.
In the early 60s, 17-year-old Ruby Doris Smith, Spelman student and eventual SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) leader, picketed, protested, and did sit-ins, trying to integrate Atlanta.
She suffered “the indignities of southern jails and numerous injuries.”
As a freedom rider, she underwent the vicious white punishment at the Montgomery bus station and was arrested and jailed by Sheriff Bull Conner.
SNCC’s Diane Nash was an important member of the first Nashville sit-ins in 1960.
After her arrest, she refused to pay her fine.
Six-months pregnant and facing a Jackson, Mississippi jailing, she vowed to “hasten the day when my child and all children will be free.”
The women of the black liberation movement of the late 60s and 70s faced even harsher reprisals—from the federal government.
Black women liberation women political prisoners, included the Black Panther’s Assata Shakur and MOVE women Janine Phillips Africa, Debbie Sims Africa, Merle Austin Africa and Janet Holloway Africa.
Janine and Janet Africa are still in prison.
In March 2019 Jet Blue was forced to take down a black history month poster which included a tribute to a “convicted murderer,” Assata Shakur.
President Trump railed against the “cop killer” and demanded Cuba return her.
Shakur was able to escape from her jail, to political exile in Cuba, and that is unforgivable to the American police state.
Assata Shakur was a major inspiration for me in writing my book Women Politicals in America: Jailed Dissenters from Mother Jones to Lynne Stewart , and because of that she appears on the cover of my book, shackled but defiant.
As a member of the BP and Black Liberation Army, Shakur was an FBI target for a long time.
As per usual with the FBI, she had been accused of a number of serious crimes, and convicted in the media of all of them and more, although she had committed none of them—including murdering police officer Werner Foerster.
All the evidence points to the impossibility of her shooting him, after having been grievously shot herself.
She was convicted and treated very harshly in prison, including 20 months in solitary in two men’s prisons under horrible conditions.
Her comrades managed to get her out, after she concluded she would be killed in prison.
Women who joined the MOVE organization in Philadelphia in the early 70s also faced incredibly unfair and violent treatment.
These followers of John Africa lived “naturally” in a community—very like other 70s communes–and believed in fighting the “system.”
The black militancy of fighting the system had them on police radar and resulted in raids that turned violent, with people who ran out to escape fires the authorities set being shot, and in which Officer James Ramp was killed—the evidence indicating probably friendly fire.
Four women were arrested: Debbie, Janine, Janet and Merle Africa.
Merle died in prison (her family said mysteriously).
Debbie was released in June 2018, but Janine Phillips and Janet Holloway Africa remain in prison, serving their 100-year sentences.
They are periodically denied parole for not “showing remorse,” remorse for being innocent and harshly, unfairly jailed.
Joy Powell is also not remorseful for being “raped, railroaded and bamboozled,” and unfairly jailed, by police/government authorities.
In the present-day police state, African-Americans are first in the line of fire, incarcerated in huge numbers, trapped on the bottom of the economic ladder, and prey to racist civilians and authorities alike.
When black women like Joy Powell speak out against militarized police brutality against blacks—they go right into the belly of the beast.
When in 2014, unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, the black community had had enough of assassinations and stood their ground: “Hands up, don’t shoot.”
Black activists were energized by Ferguson and interest in the new group Black Lives Matter intensified.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte linked key opposition politicians Wednesday to a purported plot to discredit his three-year-old administration, ramping up attacks against his opponents ahead of next week’s mid-term elections.
Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said Duterte received information that the Liberal Party as well as from the Magdalo group, which includes former junior military officers involved in a failed mutiny in 2003, were allegedly conspiring with certain media organizations to discredit the government.
“The president has received intelligence information that has been validated and appears to show that there is deliberate attempt to discredit this administration, as well as to boost the candidacies of the opposition, senatorial candidates,” Panelo said in a hastily-called news conference.
“And it appears that there are certain groups who are working together to achieve this goal,” he said.
“Some personalities identified as advocates or very active in social media, dishing out anti-Duterte statements and sentiments and validated to be allied with the Liberal Party.”
Liberal Party was the political party of former President Benigno Aquino, who was in office from 2010 to 2016.
The Magdalo group, which was allegedly behind a failed coup plot about 16 years ago, is led by Sen. Antonio Trillanes, one of the staunchest critics of Duterte’s drug war that has killed thousands.
Panelo’s statement came a week after he told reporters that the government had no substantial evidence about an alleged plot to oust Duterte, and would only file lawsuits against the alleged conspirators once an actual crime was committed.
Panelo had earlier linked online news sites Rappler and Vera Files, as well as the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism in the alleged plot to discredit the chief executive.
The three media organizations, which had published stories critical of Duterte and his family, had debunked the allegations.
Among those named by Panelo on Wednesday were Neri Colmenares, a former lawmaker and a member of the left-leaning National Union of People’s Lawyers, his colleague Carlos Zarate, as well as Gary Alejano, a member of the House of Representatives who was a former Marine captain and a close ally of Trillanes.
Panelo admitted that the government did not have “substantial evidence” as of yet, but said Duterte’s office had passed the information to the justice department, which would then study and decide whether a case can be filed.
He denied that the government was engaged in a crackdown to silence legitimate dissent in the Philippines, one Asia’s most freewheeling democracies.
“If what they are doing is black propaganda, it means it's libelous. The moment the police and other law enforcement agencies have sufficient evidence, cases will be filed against all of them,” Panelo said.
“This government cannot crack down on those who are practicing the freedom of expression,” he said.
Panelo’s statement followed recent controversy on social media after a series of independently produced videos came out with allegations that Duterte and his associates were, ironically, involved in drug trafficking.
The videos surfaced after a former police officer had accused Duterte of employing a Chinese adviser who allegedly had ties to Chinese drug traffickers.
Duterte has denied the accusation.
Long history Alejano on Wednesday charged that Panelo’s release of unverified information was not only irresponsible but libelous.
He denied having a hand in the release of the videos.
The presidential palace has “a long history of releasing unvalidated information to the public,” Alejano told reporters.
“They even backtrack or change tune in the middle of the issue,” he said.
“This is an abuse of power without being held liable for the consequences of their irresponsible actions and incompetence.”
He noted that the allegations came out days before the polls, and was clearly an attempt to “destroy the image of the opposition.”
Duterte has previously issued scandalous remarks that his spokesman had described as hyperbole.
‘I challenge him to present evidence’ Ellen Tordesillas, who heads the investigative website Vera Files, slammed Panelo and denied allegations of involvement in any anti-Duterte plot.
Vera Files has published reports that fact-checked false claims made by Duterte and his officials.
“I deny allegations by Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo linking me to any imagined destabilization efforts against the administration. I challenge him to present evidence, not just silly diagrams,” Tordesillas told reporters.
The National Union of Journalist in the Philippines on Wednesday slammed Panelo’s statements as a “piece of unadulterated crap.” “At best, this is yet another badly concocted fiction meant to scare their perceived enemies but which only ends up making them look ridiculous, “ the group said.
A Madison man accused of committing four robberies in November last year has pleaded guilty to the crimes.
Trevor Christian, 31, could face up to 80 years in federal prison, a maximum of 20 years on each count, according to the US Attorney's Office.
His guilty plea came on Wednesday in federal court in Madison.
US District Judge James Peterson scheduled sentencing for Aug. 21.
Christian has been in custody since his arrest on Nov. 14.
According to the news release, Christian robbed Walgreens on East Washington Avenue on Nov. 1, 2018, passing a note to an employee that said "All the cash in the drawer, 30 seconds, don't make me."
On Nov. 5, he robbed Associated Bank on Shopko Drive, giving a note to a teller that said "It's a robbery, give me all the money, no dye packs, don't make me do anything stupid, 20 seconds."
The note was left behind and a fingerprint was taken off it.
He then robbed Associated Bank on Odana Road on Nov. 7, giving a note to the teller that said "This is a robbery, no alarms, no dye packs, all the money in the drawer and no one gets hurt. Be calm. 20 seconds."
The fourth robbery was on Nov. 14 at Dane County Credit Union on Struck Street, with the note saying "It's a robbery, keep calm, give me 20 seconds."
In all four cases Christian got cash, but some bait bills were included in the credit union robbery, so police could use those bills as evidence.
All four robberies were captured on video, the Attorney's Office said.
Still photographs of the robber were shared with the public, and the Madison Police Department received a tip that the robber was Trevor Christian.
Police searched his apartment and found the bait money, a pair of boots seen on video and an Associated Bank money band.
His cellphone also revealed he was searching for news about the robberies.
On April 25, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided that refundable state tax brownfield credits are taxable income for federal purposes.
The court held in Ginsburg v. United States , “The excess amount of the brownfield redevelopment tax credit received by the Ginsburgs in 2013 is taxable gross income because it is an undeniable accession to wealth over which the Ginsburgs have complete dominion control.”
The case dealt with New York’s brownfield credits that may be used to reduce a taxpayer’s state tax obligations and, if there are excess credits beyond the state tax liabilities, can be refunded to the taxpayer.
The court’s decision makes that refunded credit subject to federal tax.
The taxpayers argued that the brownfield redevelopment tax credit “is a reimbursement of a portion of the capital costs,” i.e., costs relating to investments made by them for the cleanup and redevelopment of the property.
Accordingly, the Ginsburgs claimed they “neither realized an undeniable accession to wealth nor an economic gain” because the payment was a reimbursement of expenses.
They also argued they do not have complete dominion and control over the tax credits because there were many strings attached.
The court was not persuaded and found that the Ginsburgs neither alleged a payment was made to New York nor explained why the payment of the excess amount of the brownfield redevelopment tax credit was a return of their basis to restore impaired capital.
While the holding in this case is not extraordinary, it has implications for taxpayers facing a choice to take the brownfield and similar credits as a reduction of state and local taxes or getting cash by electing the refundable credit.
There are many tax credits providing for refundability in many states, including film tax credits, historic renovation credits, and various economic development incentives and tax credits.
Even before the Ginsburg case, a taxpayer who sold state tax credits had income subject to federal tax.
Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), the difference between taking the credit against state and local tax (SALT) liabilities or electing to make such a credit refundable was minimal.
Taking the cash would make the cash subject to federal tax, and taking the credit to reduce the SALT obligation would reduce the SALT deduction on a federal tax return, making the result of the choice equivalent – get taxed on the income or reduce your deductions.
However, the TCJA placed a limit of $10,000 on the deductibility of SALT for individual taxpayers.
This alters the financial effect, making it more desirable for those subject to the federal SALT limitations to reduce their nondeductible SALT liabilities rather than take a refundable credit in cash that would be subject to federal tax.
For example, if a taxpayer has a refundable tax credit of $100,000 and takes the cash, there would be federal income tax due at the rate of 21% for a corporation or up to 37% for an individual for 2019.
Using that same credit to reduce SALT obligations beyond the $10,000 annual limit eliminates the federal income tax on the refund and reduces the nondeductible SALT liabilities, providing a greater net tax benefit.
Of course, if the individual or entity expects to have little or no SALT liabilities over time due to losses or for other reasons, taking a credit would be worthless, and electing to take the refundable credit would make economic sense even if the credit is subject to federal tax.
A careful and thorough examination of projections of income and forecasts of tax liability are essential to the effort of maximizing the benefits of these tax credit programs.
Vicki Kennedy is a lawyer and the second wife of late Senator Ted Kennedy.
Vicki comes from a prominent family in Louisiana, her Father Edmund Reggie was a judge and banker and her mother Doris Ann Boustany was a Democratic National Committeewoman.
Her family acquired most of their wealth from an interest they owned in Bunny Bread baking concern.
Vicki is of Lebanese descent, all of her grandparents immigrated to the United States and settled in Louisiana.
Before marrying Ted, Vicki’s family was close to the Kennedy family due to her mom and dad working closely with Ted and John on their political campaigns in Louisiana.
Although their families were close, Vicki did not know Ted personally until the two met in 1991.
Vicki met Ted during a particularly tumultuous time in his life when the senator was known for his substance abuse and womanizing antics.
According to those close to the two, Vicki helped Ted get his life back on track and become an effective Senator again.
Following Ted’s death, Vicki became and continues to be a public figure who tried to carry on his work and legacy.
Ted Kennedy is the topic of the upcoming documentary “The Girl in the Car”.
The documentary examines an incident Ted was involved in when he crashed his car in the water off Chappaquiddick Island on the night of July 18, 1969, killing his passenger Mary Jo Kopechne.
Here is what you need to know:
1. She was married and divorced before meeting Ted.
Vicki was first married to Grier Raclin, a telecommunications lawyer in D.C. before meeting Ted.
The two were married in 1981 with a large, 400 person ceremony at Everett McKinley Dirksen Federal Courthouse.
They then moved to D.C. where they had two children, Curran and Caroline.
The couple was divorced in 1990 and Vicki then met Ted in 1992.
2. Her secret engagement to Ted was exposed by Vicki’s daughter sharing the information at school.
Ted and Vicki started dating after meeting at the 40th-anniversary dinner she threw for her parents.
Following that encounter, they started  spending time together at Vicki’s house where Ted would come over for dinner.
Vicki was a full-time lawyer and single mother with 2 small children so she was unable to spend a lot of time away from home.
Ted came to her house for dinner because it was the only time the two could  spend together.
According to Time Magazine, Vicki told Kennedy biographer Adam Clymer, “He called me and said, ‘You have got these kids. I know you won't go out more than a couple of times a week. I really want to see more of you. So I am going to come to dinner at your house.’ ” Ted proposed during a performance of La Bohème in January 1992 and they agreed to keep their engagement a secret.
Unfortunately, Vicki’s daughter told her friend at school whose parent just so happened to be a Washington Post reporter.
The reported then broke the story to the press.
3. She is friends with Ted’s first wife, Joan.
Joan Kennedy and Vicki Kennedy were not the best of friends when Ted was alive or when he first died.
AS evidenced by their obvious animosity towards each other at Ted’s funeral.
The two were kept apart during the funeral service.
According to the Daily Mail, When Joan and Ted’s eldest daughter, Kara, passed away unexpectedly from a heart attack in 2011, a mere 2 years after Ted’s death, Vicki extended an olive branch to offer help.
Joan has publicly battled with alcohol abuse and Vicki was reportedly worried that this would drive her to drink again so she reached out to help.
In the wake of tragedy, the tension has disappeared between the two who are now friends.
4. She feuded with her stepsons over the construction of the Edward M. Kennedy Institute.
One of Ted Kennedy’s final wishes was to build the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate.
The institute is an interactive museum that features a full-scale replica of the Senate chamber.
It’s located right down the street from the JFK Library.
The Institute opened in 2016 but was a somewhat tumultuous 7-year construction project.
Back in 2012, Edward M. Kennedy Jr. and Patrick Kennedy, the senator’s children from his first marriage, accused Vicki of mishandling the project and keeping them in the dark on the decisions being made.
In an interview with the Boston Globe in 2012, Lee Fentress, a longtime friend of the senator who now chairs the board, told the paper “He treasured her counsel,” adding, “He trusted her judgment and instincts. She was his right hand and partner in the very true sense.... The board of the institute unanimously agrees with his judgment of Vicki. She is a tireless and passionate advocate for the institute. We are fortunate to have her.”
While neither son would make a statement publicly, it broke a longstanding tradition of the Kennedy family airing grievances publicly.
5. Her dad managed John F. Kennedy’s Louisiana Campaign.
Vicki Kennedy’s father, Edmund Reggie, helped John F. Kennedy’s Failed Vice Presidential campaign in 1956.
He was an instrumental factor in helping JFK secure the state of Louisiana at the Democratic National Convention.
Then in 1960, Edmund co-chaired JFK’s presidential campaign efforts in Louisiana.
He was nominated as a presidential elector in Louisiana for the Democratic ticket of John F. Kennedy-Lyndon B. Johnson.
After Kennedy was elected, Reggie served the president as liaison with Louisiana Governor Jimmie Davis from 1961 until Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.
Gillian admitted to Ryan that she still loved him.
Esther kept Stuart in her trailer.
Adam escaped from Oak Haven with Arlene's help.
Leo was arrested for Paolo's murder.
Mirror Janet urged Janet to whack Jack.
Everyone believed that Stuart was dead after his cabin burned to the ground.
Other recaps for the week of April 24, 2000 April 17, 2000 May 1, 2000 Monday, April 24, 2000 It seemed only logical for Esther to wonder why Scott thought that Stuart might have dropped by her trailer.
One day me and Stuart were together --- and the next day we weren't, Esther said glumly.
Scott briefly explained that his Uncle Adam may have said or done something to upset Stuart.
Esther recalled Adam only as "the mean one."
From inside, Stuart groaned in his sleep.
Becca and Scott exchanged optimistic glances and asked Esther about the noise.
Esther swallowed hard and claimed that she had a dog, a dog that didn't take too kindly to strange faces.
She urged the pair to go on their way before the dog awoke and attacked them.
Esther pledged that she would contact them immediately if Stuart turned up.
Back inside, Esther crouched down next to Stuart and gently stroked his head.
She told the still-slumbering man that she sensed that he was in a great deal of pain --- and not just physical pain.
This was the type of pain that no one, especially Stuart, should have to endure.
Esther went on to promise Stuart that she would help him get rid of the pain he was feeling.
Stuart stirred slightly and roused from his sleep.
He was only awake for a few moments.
During his up time, he looked around and asked Esther where he was.
Esther smiled warmly and told him that he was in her trailer.
At times she looked perplexed that Stuart didn't recognize the place.
After Stuart drifted back to sleep, Esther told herself that she was going to make sure that Stuart never left her again.
Scott and Becca ended up near the ocean.
A teary Scott, angrily snapped at Becca's suggestion that they call it a night and return home.
Scott vowed that he wouldn't stop searching until he located his father.
He felt badly because he hadn't been so vigilant when his mother, Cindy, died.
To this day he couldn't help but wonder if his mother would have lived longer --- even by a day or two --- if he'd been stronger for her.
Becca took Scott in her arms and promised him that they would find Stuart.
Donald Steele made the rounds at the fundraiser, stopping by to ask Greenlee if she wanted to make a statement about Erica's drunken spectacle.
Greenlee ordered the writer to scram and walked away.
Tina and Adrian were noticeably late for the event because Tina had wanted to drop by the shelter to show off her dress.
Gillian and Ryan, meanwhile, stood face to face, neither saying a word.
Ryan finally broke the silence as he asked Gillian if they could talk.
The princess icily told her former husband that they had "nothing to say to each other," adding that she also wanted nothing to do with Ryan.
With that, Gillian turned and walked away.
As Dixie watched from the background, Tad praised Liza for her ability to handle herself under the pressure of two jobs.
Dixie pulled Tad aside and told him that she was ready to go home.
Marian suddenly burst into the room and noted that it had officially been 24 hours since anyone had seen Stuart.
Opal sat Erica down in the lobby to ask her about what had transpired in Paolo's room.
Erica was more preoccupied with the presumed failure of the fundraiser, but Opal changed all that when she revealed that she would overheard Erica threatening Paolo.
Erica quickly assured Opal that she had " taken care of" Paolo.
Erica looked around and wondered where David had gone.
Opal nodded slightly and explained that she would sent David to Paolo's room.
Upstairs, Vanessa gasped as she came across Paolo's lifeless body.
Derek placed a call to summon forensics to the scene.
Palmer questioned why his wife had become so pale.
Derek returned to the group and asked Leo to tell him how he would come across Paolo's body.
Leo lamely replied that he would wandered by the room, saw the door ajar, and noticed Paolo's body on the ground.
As Leo spoke, Derek took an object from Leo's blood-covered hand.
When Derek asked Leo if he knew the deceased, Vanessa chirped that there was no way that her son knew the likes of a criminal like Paolo.
She quickly reminded Derek that Paolo had stolen her necklace from her.
Palmer stepped forward and asked his wife to let Derek do his job.
Derek received a phone call and had to excuse himself.
Vanessa, meanwhile, tried her best to calm her son, assuring him that everything would be okay.
Leo burst out of the room.
Derek ended his phone call and pursued the young man down the corridor.
In his travels, Leo bumped into David, who quickly pulled his younger brother aside and asked him why he was in such a hurry.
By this time, Derek caught up to Leo and asked him why he was fleeing the murder scene.
If it hadn't been for that little slip, David might not have been able to step forward and help out Leo.
David calmly stated that Leo had been searching for him with the hopes of getting an expert medical opinion about whether or not the murder victim was really dead.
Alone in the hallway, Palmer panicked when he spotted a spot of blood on his sleeve.
He quickly pulled down the sleeve of his jacket, recalling how he'd caught Vanessa in the hallway wearing only a bathrobe and a later conversation with Leo in which Leo hinted that Vanessa wasn't being such a good wife.
The latest alarm signal that the US economy remains on collision course with a recession, and that the US consumer remains especially burdened by debt and challenged by cash flows despite the record high in the stock market, came after today's release of the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS ) by the Federal Reserve, which was conducted for bank lending activity during the first quarter of 2019, and which reported that while lending standards and terms for commercial and industrial loans remained largely unchanged from already generously easy levels, demand for those loans tumbled to levels not seen since the financial crisis .
Even more concerning is that banks also reported weaker demand for both commercial and residential real estate loans for the second quarter in a row, echoing the softer housing data in recent months.
First, the good news: three months after we reported that banks had continued to tighten lending standards in the last few months of 2018, potentially risking a feedback loop of tighter standard and declining demand, banks managed to break the first negative trend, and lending standards for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans remained essentially unchanged over the first quarter of 2019 for both large- and medium-sized firms as well as small firms , and on net terms for large and medium-sized firms eased slightly while terms were basically unchanged for small firms.
Some more details, via Goldman, which notes that relative to the last survey which we profiled here, standards on commercial real estate (CRE) loans tightened on net over the first quarter of the year, if more modestly than last quarter: 14% of banks reported tightening standards for construction and land development loans ; 10% of banks reported tightening standards on loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties, and 8% of banks reported tightening credit standards on loans secured by multifamily residential properties.
Banks reported that lending standards for residential mortgage loans remained largely unchanged on net in Q1 relative to the prior quarter.
Banks reported that lending standards on auto loans remained largely unchanged, and about 20% of large banks tightened standards and terms for credit cards .
33% of banks surveyed reportedly narrowed spreads of loan rates over the cost of funds, while 6% widened spreads.
15% on net reported easier loan covenants.
Other terms, such as collateralization requirements and premiums charged on riskier loans, remained largely unchanged.
Demand for loans reportedly weakened on balance.
And while the lack of further tightening in lending standards was largely unchanged from the prior quarter, despite some instances of tightening, where there was s disturbing trend continuation was in what loan officers responded  described as loan demand from large and medium corporations: here, as the chart below shows, the percentage of domestic respondents (i.e., banks) reporting stronger demand for C&I loans tumbled to the lowest level since the financial crisis, which suggests that either nobody needs debt to fund growth, expansion and new projects any more (unlikely), or potential US creditors are so worried about the future and their ability to repay, they refuse to take out any loans in the current business climate.
Digging into the data, banks reported that demand for CRE loans across all categories weakened on net, and demand for construction loans reportedly declined at 27% of banks on net.
Similarly, demand for auto loans was basically unchanged, while demand for credit card loans and other consumer loans was moderately weaker .
Banks also reported weaker demand across all surveyed residential loan categories, including home equity lines of credit.
It goes without saying, that such a sharp decline in loan demand is not what one would expect in what the BEA would represent is an economy that is growing at a 3%+ annualized rate.
Finally, responding to special questions on C&I lending to firms exposed to developments in Asia or Europe, a "moderate net fraction of banks reported they expect the quality of loans to exposed firms to deteriorate over the remainder of 2019. As a result, banks that have taken steps to mitigate risk of loan losses from such exposures reported the tightening of lending policies on new credit to exposed firms as the most frequently used action over the past year. Here would be a good time to remind readers that according to a Reuters investigation conducted in mid-December, when looking behind headline numbers showing healthy loan books, " problems appear to be cropping up in areas such as home-equity lines of credit, commercial real estate and credit cards " according to federal data reviewed by the wire service and interviews with bank execs.
Worse, banks are also starting to aggressively cut relationships with customers who seem too risky , which is to be expected: after all financial conditions in the real economy, if not the markets which just enjoyed the best January since 1987, are getting ever tighter as short-term rates remain sticky high and the result will be a waterfall of defaults sooner or later.
Here are the all too clear signs which Reuters found that banks are starting to prepare for the next recession by slashing and/or limiting risky loan exposure:
First, nearly half of the applications from customers with low credit scores were rejected in the four months ending in October, compared with 43 percent in the year-ago period, according to a survey released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Second, banks shuttered 7 percent of existing accounts, particularly among subprime borrowers, the highest rate since the Fed started conducting surveys in 2013.
Third, home-equity lines of credit declined 8 percent across the industry, with growth slowing in areas such as credit cards and commercial-and-industrial loans, the survey showed.
Then there are the bank-specific signs, starting with Capital One - one of the biggest U.S. card lenders - which is restricting how much it lends to each customer even as it aggressively recruits new ones, CEO Richard Fairbank said last December.
Regional banks have become more cautious lately as well, as they avoid financing riskier projects like early-stage construction loans and properties without pre-lease agreements.
New Jersey’s OceanFirst Bank also pulled back on refinancing transactions that let customers cash out on their debt, and has started reducing exposure to industrial loans, CEO Chris Maher told Reuters.
"On March 16, we were informed by Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj that one Pooja Rai had been brought in by her husband. An inquiry was initiated after she died ," DCP Arya said.
He added that police also found a suicide note "planted" by the accused.
A panel comprising three doctors at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital had conducted Pooja's postmortem on 18 March.
We received her autopsy report on April 27, and the surgeon opined the cause of death as homicidal. A team led by ACP Ishwar Singh started a probe, DCP Arya said.
Pooja was reportedly strangled; there were injury marks present on her occipital bone too
The police questioned Pooja's domestic help after which they learned that Padma had come to meet the victim on 16 March.
On May 1, we started questioning Rahul and Padma and confronted them with discrepancies in their statements. They eventually confessed, Arya said.
Relationship Rahul, Padma wanted to get married but families didn't allow Rahul, and Padma told the cops that they studied together in school and were also in a relationship.
Though they eventually lost touch, they met in 2015 again, after their friend added them to a school WhatsApp group.
They wanted to get married, but their families were against it, citing different castes, a senior police officer said.
"They (Rahul and Padma) continued their relationship but Rahul's marriage was fixed to Pooja in January 2017. On April 23 that year, they got married," the officer said.
Last year, Rahul asked Pooja to take Padma's help to secure an MNC job.
During her conversations, Pooja taunted Padma about her past relationship with Rahul after which the duo planned to get rid of Pooja.
Padma came to meet Pooja on 16 March with two juice packets.
She had breakfast with Pooja... After the domestic-help left, Padma asked for water...when Pooja was out of the room, she laced her glass with sedatives, Arya said.
Pooja started vomiting and tried to leave the house, but Padma allegedly overpowered and strangled her.
She then left a fake suicide-note behind, he added.
GRAND RAPIDS - Two men who owned an Albion drug store have entered pleas admitting they distributed prescription drugs and committed healthcare fraud.
John Shedd, 71 of Albion and Terry Tooley, 64, of Spring Arbor pleaded guilty Tuesday in Federal District Court in Grand Rapids to charges of conspiracy to distribute prescription drug controlled substances and conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, according to U.S. Attorney Andrew Birge.
They both face up to five years in federal prison and they have agreed to surrender their Drug Enforcement Administration pharmacy registrations, forfeit $1.2 million to the U.S. government and pay $500,000 in restitution to the healthcare benefit programs they defrauded.
Shedd and Tooley – both former owners – admitted they committed the crimes while they owned and operated Parks Drug Store at 318 S. Superior St.
, in Albion.
Federal investigators said that between 2012 and 2016 the men filled six times more controlled substance prescriptions than other Albion pharmacies.
The substances included oxycodone, hyrdrocodone and methadone.
Included in court documents was the allegation that Shedd and Tooley became aware in 2016 that Dr. Horace J. Davis of Albion was prescribing methadone "outside the usual course of professional practice and without legitimate medical purpose."
The federal prosecutors said the men continued to fill prescriptions from Davis even following media reports that Davis had been charged in 2016 with federal crimes for prescribing methodone and that one of their drug wholesalers stopped providing drugs to the store.
Prosecutors said Shedd and Tooley continued to fill prescriptions from Davis after he had been indicted.
The store filled 50,000 doses during the period, court records show.
The government also alleged that from 2013 to 2016 the store submitted claims to insurance carriers for medication it did not actually dispense or was not covered.
The loss was estimated at $298,700 to Medicare Part D and $34,700 and $166,500 to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan.
Davis was convicted in 2017 of federal drug trafficking crimes and healthcare fraud.
The investigation was conducted by the Albion Department of Public Safety, the Calhoun County Sheriff Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations.
Assistant United States Attorney Clay Stiffler prosecuted the case.
You may have seen the video going around of State Rep. Brian Sims (D-Philadelphia) harassing and mocking a woman praying outside of a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic in Philadelphia.
This is shameful behavior, especially by a current lawmaker.
But did you know this is the largest abortion clinic for Planned Parenthood in Pennsylvania?
And they have a shameful health and safety record with the state, with no repercussions.
The Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center at Locust Street (Philadelphia), has failed 13 of their last 23 patient safety inspections.
Below is a summary of the failings in each of the thirteen failed inspections, which include failing to report child sex abuse, improper storage of aborted babies, failure to report a serious incident to a patient and no background checks on employees.
Even with these failures, there is no indication that this location was ever fined, penalized or forced to closed until the failures have been remedied.

They failed to ensure Nursing Policies and Procedures were established for the facility.
Annual Registration Survey – September 1, 2016 – FAILED They failed to determine a physical status on all patients before anesthesia or surgery.
Annual Registration Survey – August 20, 2015 – FAILED They failed to provide a safe and sanitary environment.
The lab refrigerator / freezer had a build up of ice within the refrigerator / freezer.
Failed to properly store gauze sponges.
Failed to properly sterilize surgical instruments, wraps, pouches, and metal containers.

The cushion of a patient bench had multiple darkened stains.
Special Monitoring Survey – August 13, 2015 – FAILED They failed to properly store human pathological waste.
An environmental services closet containing used biohazard containers was not locked and appeared that the locking mechanism was not working properly in order to prevent unauthorized access to biohazardous materials.
An unlocked, biohazard storage freezer located on a countertop revealed a heavy accumulation of ice and frost build up and several freezer bags containing red biohazard bags.
The red biohazard bags contained “products of conception” – aborted babies.
Two of the red biohazard bags were undated.
Full State Licensure Survey – August 29, 2013 – FAILED PPSP Surgical Locust Street Health Center was not in compliance with The Pennsylvania Crimes Code and the Child Protective Service Law.
Sexual intercourse with a child less than 13 years of age is always a crime without regard to the age or relationship of the offender, and without regard to the “consent” of the child.
Under Pennsylvania law, a child less than 13 years of age is incapable of consent to sexual intercourse.
Sexual intercourse with a child less than 16 years of age is a crime if the offender is four or more years older than the child, and the child and offender are not married to each other.
Under Pennsylvania law, an unmarried individual less than 16 years of age is incapable of consent to sexual intercourse with a person who is four or more years older.
Accordingly, under all circumstances, any child less than 13 years of age who is pregnant, or who is found to have a sexually-transmitted disease or condition, is a child “upon whom injuries have been inflicted in violation of [a] penal law of this Commonwealth.”
So is any child less than 16 years of age if the person who caused the pregnancy, or who caused the child to have a sexually-transmitted disease or condition, is four or more years older than the child and is not married to the child.
Professional contact with a child less than 13 years of age who is pregnant, or who has a sexually-transmitted disease or condition, therefore triggers a duty, on the part of those health care providers identified in 18 Pa.
to report under the Crimes Code in all circumstances.
Contact with a child less than 16 years of age who is pregnant, or who has a sexually-transmitted disease or condition, triggers a duty to report under the Crimes Code if the person who caused the pregnancy, or who caused the child to have a sexually-transmitted disease or condition, is four or more years older than the child and is not married to the child.
Failure to report as required by the Crimes Code is a summary offense punishable by fine and/or imprisonment.
This is not met as evidenced by: They failed to develop a policy that met the reporting requirements for statutory sexual assault victims
NEW ORLEANS – The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana has again granted a motion to dismiss an insurance malpractice lawsuit filed by protective coatings company Rhino Shield Gulf South (Rhino Shield GS).
U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman issued an opinion April 15 in a dispute involving Rhino Shield Gulf South and its sole member, James Redmond, and their insurers, RSUI Group and Landmark American Insurance Company.
dissolved in 2015 The dispute involves Rhino Shield of Louisiana, a two-member limited liability company comprised of Redmond and Kevin Mmahat, which dissolved in 2015, court filings said.
The company, which operated in Louisiana under an agreement with Rhino Shield Gulf South, a Florida LLC, bought liability policies through RSUI and Landmark.
Between 2013 and 2017, Rhino Shield customers filed claims and lawsuits against the company.
In response, RSUI and Landmark, as well as appointed liability counsel Brian Carr, got settlement contributions from Redmond and Rhino Shield Gulf South “by misrepresenting that Redmond might face personal liability,” court filings said.
Redmond filed a state lawsuit in October alleging bad faith claims-adjusting practices against RSUI and Landmark and a legal malpractice claim against Carr.
RSUI and Landmark removed the case to federal court, after which Carr was dismissed with prejudice.
On Feb. 5, the court granted the insurers’ motion to dismiss, without prejudice, finding the plaintiffs didn’t plausibly allege they were insured under an RSUI or Landmark policy and didn’t plead enough facts to sustain the bad faith or fraud claims.
The plaintiffs amended that complaint in March, citing 12 lawsuits from customers dealing directly with defective installations or faulty Rhino Shield products and a list of nine payments Redmond and the company made to settle disputes.
“The amended complaint stops short of alleging that any of these lawsuits or claims named Mr. Redmond, as opposed to his single-member LLC (Rhino Shield GS), as a defendant, so as to trigger Redmond’s status as an insured,” Feldman wrote.
The judge further said that while the amended complaint clarifies Rhino Shield GS was named as an “additional insured” for some policies Covington Specialty Insurance Company issued, and which RSUI administered, between May 8, 2013, and April 24, 2015, the complaint doesn’t clarify which policies may have been triggered by each of the cited claims, providing “no basis to infer that Rhino Shield GS is an insured with respect to any claim that is alleged to have been asserted against it.”
Feldman also said the list of payments Redmond cited in the amended complaint lacked the requisite specificity, as it didn’t include details about which plaintiff made which payments, but rather said they were “made directly by Rhino Shield GS and/or James M. Redmond.”
Redmond argued the lack of clarity came because RSUI didn’t adequately communicate which entity was supposed to pay “or which dismissals the settlement funds of each check purported to secure,” Feldman wrote.
“But, the plaintiffs overlook that, regardless of how any payment was allegedly used or characterized, their complaint fails to allege which plaintiff issued each settlement check.”
Feldman granted the insurers’ motion to dismiss, again without prejudice, granting leave for a second amended complaint within 30 days.
Should Redmond fail to meet that deadline, Feldman said he would dismiss the complaint with prejudice.
It has been ten years since Najibullah Zazi and two friends plotted to detonate homemade explosives on the New York City subway system.
At the time, then-Attorney General Eric Holder called it "one of the most serious terrorist threats" the nation had faced since Sept. 11.
On Thursday, a federal judge in New York gave Zazi what he described from the bench as a "once-unthinkable second chance" when he sentenced him to time served, meaning he could be released within "days," according to his defense attorney.
That's because Zazi - facing up to life in prison following his 2009 arrest -- pleaded guilty and began a decade of cooperation against al-Qaeda, according to prosecutors.
Zazi has provided extraordinary cooperation, meeting with the government more than 100 times, viewing hundreds of photographs, and providing information that assisted law enforcement officials in a number of different investigations even where Zazi did not personally know the subjects of those investigations, federal prosecutors said in their sentencing memorandum.
In federal court in Brooklyn, New York on Thursday, Zazi conceded he committed "terrible crimes" when he plotted with two friends to blow up the NYC subways but told the judge he tried his best to "correct my horrific mistake" by cooperating over the last decade.
Zazi, 33, stood before the judge in a navy smock, shaved head and close-cropped beard transformed -- his attorney contended -- from a naive, uneducated 20-something to a "mature adult" who has "unequivocally repudiates radical Islam."
Zazi said he was no longer the "naive, gullible" person who traveled to Pakistan in 2008 and trained with al-Qaeda.
He said it is "unimaginable" to him now what he became  involved with and he sought forgiveness.
Judge Raymond Dearie said a question lingered in his mind: "Has he rejected Satan?"
The judge answered "I think you have."
In imposing time served plus lifetime supervised release the judge noted "This once unthinkable second chance has come your way and you earned it."
The judge added, when pressed by prosecutors to be thorough, "If you wish to appeal the sentence of the court you should have your head examined."
The extent of Zazi's cooperation has never been formally articulated.
A sentencing memorandum prosecutors filed Wednesday is redacted but made clear Zazi has been a vital source for those in the U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities who sought to understand al-Qaeda, its motivations and its methods.
Once Zazi decided to cooperate in February 2010, he gave the government his full, complete cooperation, according to court records.
He proffered at great length about every aspect of his conduct without minimizing his actions, nor were there any areas of questioning that Zazi refused to address, the memo said, using to a common legal term for making an offer of information prior to any formal plea negotiations.
Zazi was born in Afghanistan, grew up in Peshawar in Pakistan and came to Queens when he was 14, according to officials.
Zazi went to Flushing High School but did not graduate.
He operated a coffee cart on Wall Street before a 2008 trip to Pakistan.
While in Pakistan, Zazi and his co-conspirators joined al-Qaeda, received training in weapons and explosives, and agreed to conduct a terrorist attack in New York City, federal prosecutors said.
In the last decade, Zazi has related his experience at an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan, where he and his friends had gone -- thinking that they would join the Taliban.
It was there that Zazi committed to the subway plot that unfolded in Colorado, where Zazi had been working as a shuttle bus driver at the Denver airport.
It involved explosives made in a Aurora hotel room from beauty products and driven across the George Washington Bridge.
Although the precise timing of the attacks had not been worked out, federal prosecutors said Zazi and his accomplices "had agreed on the ultimate goal of detonating the bombs during suicide attacks in the New York City subway system."
Zazi's attorney William Stamper said that he expected that Zazi would be released in "days."
Zazi is at least the third admitted terrorist from the New York City area to receive little or no additional prison time after cooperating with federal investigators.
Zazi's co-conspirator Bryant Neal Vinas, a former altar boy from Queens, and Zarein Ahmedzay, have both been released from prison after cooperating with authorities for years.
By Dickson Seven. Women who were arrested in Abuja and convicted by a mobile court for prostitution have alleged that policemen attached to the Utako and Gwarimpa Police stations in Abuja raped and physically assaulted them in custody.
They also claimed that the police compelled them to plead guilty when they were arraigned before the court on Monday.
Narrating their ordeal to journalists on Thursday, the women, who spoke anonymously, said after their arrest at a nightclub and a hotel, the police allegedly threw them into a cell and repeatedly tear-gassed them.
One of the victims, explained that a policeman, attached to the Utako Police Station, who was simply identified as 'Yellow,' allegedly hit her with a baton and also flogged her with a horse whip several times, injuring her arm and face in the process.
Her co-convicts, who lamented the alleged emotional abuse and physical torture they suffered while in detention, also corroborated her explanations.
Another victim, who claimed to have been arrested at a shopping plaza, alleged that the policemen attached to the FCT ministerial task force raped her when she could not pay them.
She stated, "Three of us were brought out of the van and raped by the policemen because we had no money to give them. We were raped behind the National War College, Abuja. They pushed me to the ground and held me there while one of them raped me. He didn't wear a condom. The other girls were also raped by two others, one of whom used a pure water sachet as condom."
Another victim said she was picked up by the police at a hotel where she attended a birthday bash.
She stated, "I was invited to a birthday party at an apartment in a hotel. I came to the reception to get water and a woman suddenly held my hands and pushed me out of the hotel. I saw a lot of people with cameras and some with mobile phones taking my pictures and shooting a video of the arrest. "They took me to Zone 6 Police Station and from there, to the Utako Police Station.
I was on my period and I begged a policewoman to help me with a pad, but she refused.
We were not allowed to make phone calls to our family members; I don't know how my sister got to know, and she brought a pad for me.
When I wanted to use it, a male policeman followed me inside the toilet and was watching me. This is not fair. A policeman, Yellow, beat me when I demanded my phone. The next day, they took us to Life Camp Police Station after which they took us to Area 3. The policemen said we should plead guilty before the court otherwise, we would be remanded in prison.
An activist, Dorothy Njemanze, also narrated her experience in the hands of policemen who allegedly molested her, adding that she was awarded N6m damages by the court in 2017.
She lamented that the Federal Government had refused to pay the award.
The acting FCT police spokesman, ASP Gajere Danjuma, said the commissioner of police was aware of the allegations, which he said were being investigated.
MILWAUKEE -- Eric Bledsoe was fuming. He knew better than to be baited by Joel Embiid -- one of the league's most notorious trash-talkers -- but the game was physical.
It happened so quickly: jostling for the rebound, the shove, Embiid tossing the ball at Bledsoe, who fired it back into Embiid's gut, the whistle.
Just like that, Bledsoe was ejected.
The Philadelphia crowd taunted him as he walked down the corridor and back to the visitors locker room in Wells Fargo Center, flanked by two security guards.
Bledsoe understood that the Milwaukee Bucks pride themselves on being a team that is calm and collected.
But his teammates call him a pit bull for a reason.
Days later, in a secluded corner of Carnevor, a dimly lit steakhouse in downtown Milwaukee, Bledsoe and Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer rehashed the play.
Over cuts of medium-rare filet mignon, Budenholzer reminded his starting point guard why he needed to keep his cool.
In the first round of the 2018 playoffs, Bledsoe became embroiled in an extended back-and-forth with Celtics guard Terry Rozier, and he later admitted the war of words got in his head.
For the Bucks to reach their goal of winning a title, Budenholzer explained, they could not afford for Bledsoe to lose his temper.
He was not pissed, Bledsoe said.
He was just saying in the future, especially in the playoffs, you can't make it personal.
Between bites, Budenholzer recalled the fate of the Golden State Warriors after Draymond Green was suspended for Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals, which the Cleveland Cavaliers won en route to making history by overcoming a 3-1 series deficit.
They discussed how Amar'e Stoudemire's suspension hurt the Phoenix Suns in the 2007 Western Conference semifinals.
There were times, Budenholzer said, that teams will just try to beat you by playing mental games.
He said sometimes teams may not be more talented than us, but they might try to get in our heads, Bledsoe said.
Which brings us to Friday -- two days before the Celtics-Bucks postseason rematch.
Look, Bledsoe said, spinning a basketball between his hands and leaning up against the padded wall of the Bucks' practice facility.
He knows the questions about Rozier are coming.
He knows all eyes are on him.
He admits he is nervous and fully expects to be taunted and ridiculed when the Bucks play in TD Garden.
And he is sick of talking about it.
This series, for Bledsoe, is a mental test.
He must maintain his composure and handle the nerves that can creep up, particularly early in games.
He wants to prove to himself that he is a more focused player than he showed last season.
I'm just trying to move on, he said.
Morry Gash/AP Photo. IN THE DAYS after the Bucks fell to the Celtics in Game 7 last season, Bledsoe spent a lot of time watching film.
He did not watch film of Rozier splashing a clutch 3-pointer over him in Game 1, or film of Rozier scoring 23 points in Game 2, or the interview in which Rozier accidentally referred to Bledsoe as "Drew."
Those things, particularly Rozier's 3, are seared into his memory.
I can't downplay it, Bledsoe said.
He made a hell of a move. I could have still contested it, but I just stopped. I did not think he was going to make it. That comes back to respect. I didn't respect him at the time, but he made a big shot. I have to tip my hat.
Instead, Bledsoe dusted off film from 2013, his first season with the Suns.
It was the first time he had been a starter.
Back then, he said, he was having a lot of fun.
I went back and looked myself in the mirror and reminded myself that a lot of people said I could not be a starter, Bledsoe said.
I watched film of what took me over the hump -- I was not worried about what so many people thought of me. I was just focused on myself back then.
That Celtics series revealed weaknesses he knew he needed to address, such as his bouts with overconfidence and his occasional habit of being complacent.
Bledsoe spent the summer of 2018 in Arizona, where he got back into the gym immediately.
He would go in the early morning and sometimes again late at night, convinced his conditioning played a role in why the Bucks lost.
He flew to Las Vegas and Milwaukee to work out with Charles Lee, a Bucks assistant coach.
He took yoga classes to help with his nerves, balance and flexibility.
He worked on breathing techniques.
He would later employ that deep breathing as a way to calm the frayed nerves he has battled for more than a decade.
A new season began.
With a new coach, a new offensive system and Giannis Antetokounmpo playing at an MVP level, Milwaukee got off to a blazing-hot start.
The Bucks played the Celtics for the first time Nov. 1 and lost.
Bledsoe missed a key free throw down the stretch of that game.
Instead of going home when the Bucks' plane landed in Milwaukee that night, Bledsoe and Lee went to the practice facility to work on the shots Bledsoe missed.
Find everything you need to know about the playoffs here.
Reminders of the Boston series popped up sporadically.
During a Dec. 12 game in Indiana, Pacers fans took a page out of the Boston crowd's playbook, chanting, "Who is Bledsoe?" when he shot free throws.
The Bucks beat the Celtics in their next two matchups, with Bledsoe posting 16 points in the first meeting but just five in their second.
At the time, Bledsoe wasn't concerned about the five-point game.
He chalked it up to shaking off some rust because it was the first game after the All-Star break.
In March, Bledsoe signed a four-year, $70 million extension to remain in Milwaukee.
The Bucks marched along to clinch the No. 1 seed in the NBA with a league-best 60 victories.
They swept the Detroit Pistons in the first round of the playoffs and had six days off before facing the Celtics.
They held three practices and two days of individual workouts.
The time off felt like an eternity.
Antetokounmpo joked that it was long enough to take a mini-vacation to the Bahamas.
The days crept along.
Arrangements were made for the Bucks to get a private screening of the new Avengers movie.
Bledsoe attended with his family.
"I just want to play already," Bledsoe said two days before the second round of the playoffs began.
"I'm ready to get the first one out of the way."
The 22-year-old Overland Park man charged with murder Saturday in the killing of a shopkeeper in Viterbo, Italy, attended the University of Missouri-Kansas City for two semesters but did not graduate.
Michael Aaron Pang is accused of beating the 74-year-old shop worker to death after he was unable to pay for clothes in the small town near Rome, according to Italy’s paramilitary police, the Carabinieri.
The shopkeeper, Norveo Fedeli, was hit with a stool and was found dead in his shop Friday, local media reported.
Pang was born in Seoul, the capital of South Korea, and graduated from Blue Valley Northwest High School in Overland Park.
He then attended UMKC for two semesters, in fall 2015 and spring 2016, a UMKC spokesman said.
He was enrolled in the college’s school of computing and engineering but did not earn a degree.
Pang is a graphic designer who arrived in Italy about two months ago on a tourist visa, according to his lawyer, Remigio Sicilia.
He rented a room at a bed and breakfast in the village of Capodimonte.
The lawyer said Pang had a desire to learn Italian and work in Italy.
He reportedly does not speak Italian and used his mobile phone translator to communicate.
“He’s 22, but he is like a child,” the lawyer said.
“He’s a well-behaved boy from a good American family.”
Pang allegedly ordered designer clothes worth about $670 from Fedeli’s store and went to the store twice before Friday to purchase them.
His credit card, however, was rejected.
A scuffle broke out between Pang and Fedeli before Pang killed the storekeeper, police said.
Pang changed his clothes and took Fedeli’s wallet before fleeing with one of his shoes covered in a bag.
Police allegedly found Fedeli’s wallet and other evidence in the room Pang rented.
When Pang was arrested in nearby Capodimonte, the lake town where he was reportedly living, he had cuts on his hands and “traces of blood on his shoe,” according to a reporter in Rome for The Guardian.
Pang faces murder and robbery charges.
The area’s prosecutor told local reporters they had strong evidence to charge Pang.
Pang’s family is not traveling to Italy, Sicilia told a reporter with Il Messaggero, an Italian newspaper based in Rome.
Sicilia could not immediately be reached by The Star for comment Monday.
Pang’s parents did not return calls Sunday.
Viterbo’s mayor declared Monday a day of mourning for the shopkeeper, according to media reports.
He called Fedeli “a good and kind man,” The Guardian reported.
“The murder of our citizen, Norveo Fedeli, has shattered us all,” said the mayor, Giovanni Arena, according to The Guardian.
Two men were sentenced Thursday in St. Croix District Court for distribution of crack cocaine and, in a separate case, another man was sentenced for illegally entering the country, according to U.S. Attorney Gretchen C.F. Shappert.
Two Sentenced in Crack Cocaine Case Nolly King, a 36-year-old St. Croix resident, was sentenced Thursday for distribution of crack cocaine, and Thaddeus Hendricks, 39, also of St. Croix, was sentenced for distribution of cocaine, Shappert said.
According to court documents, both men were associates of Robert Klyvert, who is pending sentencing in federal court.
Visiting Judge Anne E. Thompson sentenced King to 24 months and two years of supervised release, plus a fine of $500 and a $100 special assessment.
Hendricks was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison and two years of supervised release.
Thompson also ordered him to pay a fine of $500 and a $100 special assessment.
On Jan. 29, King pleaded guilty to distribution of crack cocaine.
According to the plea agreement filed in court, on Dec. 31, 2016, a confidential source – also known as a CS – made arrangements with King to pick up crack cocaine in Orlando, Florida that King was holding for Robert Klyvert, aka “Family.”
Klyvert was subsequently charged, has entered a guilty plea, and is pending sentencing in federal court.
At approximately 9:45 a.m., the CS called King and informed him that the source was ready.
King instructed the CS to wait 20 to 25 minutes.
At approximately 10 a.m., King called and told the CS to come to his house.
When the source pulled up, King exited the residence, greeted the source engaged in conversation.
After a few minutes, King re-entered the house and came back holding a white plastic bag containing crack cocaine.
The CS asked King what was wrong with the crack cocaine.
King stated that people did not like the color and showed the CS a sample.
The CS took the crack cocaine and left the scene.
Subsequent lab tests confirmed that the substance that the CS obtained from King was indeed crack cocaine and cocaine powder, and the net weight was 884.18 grams.
On Jan. 29, Hendricks pleaded guilty to distribution of cocaine.
According to the plea agreement filed in federal court, on Jan. 15, 2017, Hendricks traveled by plane from St. Croix to St. Thomas, carrying a black backpack that contained cocaine intended for Robert Klyvert, aka “Family.”
Hendricks asked the CS to take him to the Palms Court Hotel so that Hendricks could get a room while he waited for his flight back to St. Croi
While at the hotel, the CS gave Hendricks $22,000 and told him it was for the cocaine Hendricks had picked up in Orlando.
Hendricks removed the cocaine from of the backpack and placed it on the floor of the front passenger seat where he was sitting.
The CS inspected the cocaine and the Hendricks entered the hotel.
Later that day, Hendricks arrived at the Rohlsen Airport in St. Croix and got into a car driven by Robert Klyvert.
Subsequent lab tests confirmed that the backpack Hendricks showed to the CS contained cocaine with a net weight of 971.8 grams.
The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with assistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Rhonda Williams-Henry and Melissa Ortiz.

A SERIAL rape suspect linked to 12 vile sex attacks including on an elderly woman and a boy of 11 was arrested yesterday after a hero cabbie took him to police.
Joseph McCann, 34, was finally cornered in the early hours of Monday morning after allegedly kidnapping two 14-year-old girls in Congleton, Cheshire, on Sunday evening.
The girls were amazed freed "extremely shaken" but unharmed after their alleged abductor crashed a black Fiat Punto while being pursued by cops.
Following the collision, McCann tried to make his escape from the area in a taxi at around 8.30pm.
But the quick-thinking cabbie realised who his passenger was and pulled over after flashing his lights at a cop.
Telling of the ordeal, the driver - who asked not to be named - said: "I recognised it was him after reading the news earlier in the day.
He threatened me not to go a certain way and kept saying don't stop.
But on purpose I drove the way on the A34 and he didn't know where I was going.
I passed an accident on the A34 that I heard about to spot police.
I left my hazard lights on as well so I could be pulled over by police.
He started to kick off and I was getting scared but I kept driving.
Further up the road, I saw a police officer talking to another member of the public on the side of the road, so I flashed them.
He said McCann punched him in the face and assaulted the officer as he fled across fields.
The cabbie added: I pulled up and he started to punch me in the face, the officer jumped in the car.
I put on the child locks but he kept pulling at the door and it opened.
He started fighting with the officer and he picked up a broken bit of glass off the floor and ran off into the fields.
After being cornered, McCann climbed a tree and eventually surrendered at 3am yesterday.
The driver said: An officer thanked me and said if not for my quick thinking, he’d have got away.
Congleton resident Robert Burns, 45, was preparing to watch Line Of Duty when cops knocked on his door.
He said: “I was expecting the drama to be on TV not in the field outside my house.”
McCann is suspected of striking on four occasions in just over ten hours before he was finally cornered after allegedly abducting two girls aged 14.
Earlier that day he allegedly raped a boy aged 11 and a teenage girl after abducting a woman in her 30’s in the same incident.
And he is suspected of abducting and raping a 71-year-old woman five hours later.
Before Sunday, he was wanted for raping three women in their 20’s in London and Hertforshire.
The savage spate of attacks involved a total of 12 victims who were seemingly targeted regardless of their age or gender.
His capture brought to an end a nationwide hunt launched following the three rapes last month.
DCI Katherine GoodwinMetropolitan Police DCI Katherine Goodwin, of the Met’s Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: “Between Sunday, 21 April and Saturday, 5 May McCann is suspected to have been involved in a number of attacks across different parts of the country.
“I can confirm he is now being investigated for offences committed in Cheshire, Manchester and Lancashire in addition to London and Hertfordshire.
DCI Goodwin added: These attacks were grotesque and horrifying.
These victims are now being supported by specialist officers. Further details concerning specific offences will become clearer in due course.
“I would urge any other victims to come forward.
‘’We also need to hear from anyone who has been approached or been in contact with McCann between and May.’’
The shocking rape spree began when a woman in her 20’s was raped in her home in Watford, Herts, at 3.30am on Sunday 21 April.
Exclusive footage obtained by The Sun Online showed McCann pull into a BP garage in Watford just after 9am on April 21.
A young woman, believed to be his first victim, was in the passenger seat of his Ford Mondeo.
A woman of a similar age was then abducted off a street in Chingford, East London, at 12.30am on Thursday, 25 April and raped in a car.
Around 12 hours later another woman in her 20’s was snatched off a street in Edgware, North London, and raped in the same car.
She and the woman were taken earlier that day and managed to escape after hitting their captor with a bottle after he had tried to book into a hotel.
Police publicly released details of the double kidnap and rape the next day and later issued CCTV of the alleged white and muscular abductor and his blue Ford Mondeo.
McCann was named by cops on 30 April and a £20,000 reward offered for information leading to his capture.
CHESTERFIELD, Va – The man charged with shooting his estranged wife and killing her boyfriend began plotting a murder-for-hire scheme from behind bars at Riverside Regional Jail, according to the theory of the case laid out Monday morning by Chesterfield prosecutors.
The defense attorneys for Joshua, Joseph, and Wendy Federico argued that ‘talking about a murder plot’ and ‘putting one in action’ were different things.
The preliminary hearing in Chesterfield General District Court was to decide whether or not the long list of charges the three suspects face should be certified to the higher court, but gave a glimpse into the strategies both prosecutors and defense attorneys will utilize moving forward.
Chesterfield Police previously charged Joshua Federico with murder after the remains of 38-year-old Lawrence J. Howell, the boyfriend of his estranged wife, were discovered in a burn pit at a horse farm adjacent to his home on Second Branch Road on Aug. 24, according to Crime Insider sources.
Federico’s wife survived the shooting, and prosecutors said Monday she identified him as the trigger man.
Joseph Federico, Joshua’s brother, and Wendy Federico, Joshua’s mother, were charged last December with conspiring to plot and carry out the murder for hire scheme at the direction of Joshua, prosecutors said.
Because his estranged wife identified him and a civil lawsuit filed by her family, prosecutors said Joshua Federico was “looking to wipe out” his wife, her father, and her brother.
In court Monday, Chesterfield detectives revealed they obtained a wiretap for two phone numbers belonging to Joseph Federico after they received evidence that the Federicos were plotting the scheme.
Prosecutors played nearly a dozen phone conversations involving Joshua, Joseph, Wendy, and a family acquaintance, where they discussed how to hire someone to carry out the murders and how much it would cost.
The Federicos owned a horse farm on Black Road near Winterpock, and prosecutors said the would coded language while on the phone to discuss the plans.
For instance, a “bail” meant money, and “the sale of the horse” referenced the murder for hire plan.
During one conversation played in court Monday, Joseph Federico expressed frustration with the coded language system, saying that “if the cops were listening” to the recorded jailhouse phone calls Joshua was making, they would be able to easily figure out what they were discussing.
During another call, Wendy Federico said the family should hire their own “resource” instead of working through Joshua’s jail contacts, at one point saying, “If I have to do it, I will.”
Defense attorneys argued that since the Federicos owned a farm, the coded language was not nefarious and said prosecutors did not provide evidence to the contrary.
Chesterfield detectives testified and played video of a meeting the Joshua Federico set up with what turned out to be an undercover Virginia State Police agent.
The meeting took place in late November at the Wawa near the intersection of Spring Run and Hull Street, prosecutors said.
During the meeting, the VSP undercover agent offers to carry out the murders for $100, 000.
According to the video, Joseph Federico said he was “in a pickle” because his brother was set on wiping out his wife and her family members.
Detectives said they recovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash that was either hidden or buried at the Federico’s farm on Black Road.
The defense teams pushed back, arguing that while there may be talk of a murder for hire plot, nothing actually happened.
Wendy Federico’s attorney noted that although there were discussions, there were no direct threats or even contact with Joshua Federico’s estranged wife.
He said the phone conversations sounded like “Dumb and Dumber trying to figure something out,” but not being able to organize anything.
Joseph Federico’s attorney noted that no money was ever exchanged and that prosecutors needed more than the fact that the Federicos talked about an apparent scheme to prove a conspiracy.
In the end, Judge Keith Hurly certified the three conspiracy charges all three defendants faced to Chesterfield Circuit court.
Judge Hurly also certified a solicitation charge leveled against Joshua and Joseph Federico connected to the plot.
The judge dismissed several other charges for all three defendants faced, including attempted capital murder and obstruction of justice.
All three were held without bond while their case makes its way over to Chesterfield Circuit Court.
Later this year, Joshua Federico is scheduled to go to trial for murder and other charges related to the August 2018 shooting.
Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile , the new Ted Bundy movie starring Zac Efron, is finally available to watch on Netflix and people... have feelings.
Sure, the film is very entertaining, but it's based on the very tragic, very real events that actually happened.
Ted Bundy murdered at least 30 people in the 1970s, and some viewers feel that the movie glorifies a serial killer.
If you haven't seen Extremely Wicked yet, you should know that it's from the perspective of Liz Kendall.
Liz, whose real name is Elizabeth Kleopfer (more on that, later), dated Ted for seven years.
Here's everything you need to know about her.
Elizabeth "Liz" Kendall is a pseudonym that she picked up when she wrote her memoir, The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy .
It's not exactly clear why Liz chose to write under a pseudonym, but one would assume it had SOMETHING to do personal safety, considering the fact that she dated a literal serial killer.
In the trailer, you'll notice an adorable curly-haired toddler.
This is Liz's daughter, Tina.
She was born before Liz ever met Ted, and her birth father was actually a convicted felon.
Although Ted was not Tina's biological dad, Liz was seeking a father figure for the tot when the two first met.
While they dated, Ted played a significant role in Tina's life, and would even when Liz was not able to.
Apparently, Liz met Ted shortly after moving to Seattle from Ogden.
At the time, she was a struggling, recently divorced mother.
She approached Ted on a rare night out at a bar with a friend.
Liz became increasingly dependent on Ted, and actually almost married him.
However, their relationship was VERY rocky.
We would be getting along fine, and then a door would slam and I would be out in the cold until Ted was ready to let me back in, Liz explained in her book.
In Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes, the newly released Netflix docuseries, Ted says that the pair had little in common.
In the Netflix docuseries, Liz tipped off police because she thought that Ted might be the man they were searching for.
Although she didn't feel as though he was necessarily capable or murder, she did notice that he suspiciously matched the suspect profile, due to his name, car, and the fact that he was usually M.I.A. when the murders occurred.
She also found a bowl of women's underwear, a bunch of bandages and casts that Ted would wear to pretend to be injured to lure in victims, and a knife in his car.
Despite all of these sketchy findings, there wasn't enough evidence to connect Ted to the case at the time, so Liz's tip was of little help.
Although Ted's behavior became increasingly bizarre, Liz continued to date him and even kept in contact when he was on death row.
At some point, the couple's sex became disturbing, and his daily actions were strange, as well.
While serving jail time in Florida, Ted called Liz and admitted that he once tried to murder her.
He said that he tampered with the fireplace and put a towel in the crack of a door so that so that the smoke would stay in the house.
In hindsight, Liz wrote that she remembered the night, and opened a window for some fresh air when she was having trouble breathing.
During interrogation, Ted revealed that he once burned the head of one of his victims, Donna Mason, in the same fireplace that he used to try to kill Liz.
In her book, Liz wrote that she really loved "warm and loving" Ted.
However, she struggles to come to terms with his actions.
I pray for Ted, but I am sickened by him, she wrote.
A boozed-up brute earned himself a conviction for assault after a bust-up with his girlfriend turned violent.
Leon MacKinnon, 23, snapped and punched Stevi Rollo on the face after the couple’s argument got out of hand at the Erskine Bridge Hotel following a lengthy drinking session.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard the warring pair, who have now split up, kicked up such a racket that numerous hotel guests complained about the noise, including shouting abuse, screaming threats, and moving furniture around their room in the early hours of the morning.
Procurator fiscal depute Claire Rowan said: “The accused and the complainer had been in a relationship together. “On March 1, they attended the Erskine Bridge Hotel , intending to stay overnight. “Both had been drinking alcohol throughout the afternoon. They checked in at 9pm. They ordered food to be delivered to their room. “They continued to drink and, as the evening progressed, witnesses in the next room could hear music being played. It seemed as if the complainer and the accused were having a party.”
However, around 2.30am guests were amazed and woken by the complainer shouting at the accused, which sparked an argument, where MacKinnon tried to leave the room, however, he was prevented by the complainer.
The fiscal added: “The complainer made threats. She said she would stab the accused. “This was heard by other guests and reported to the reception. “Witnesses could hear a female shouting and swearing, including ‘I hate you,’ and ‘I am going to stab you.’ “The accused’s voice appeared to be quite calm.”
The court was told furniture was being moved around the room with attempts at blocking the door.
However, the furniture was moved back from the door, and both he and she ended up in the corridor outside where they continued to fight.
The fiscal added: “Witnesses heard sounds of Ms Rollo repeatedly punching and hitting the accused. “Witnesses heard the accused state that he wanted to leave. “The duty manager had been contacted by guests and when he attended he noticed Ms Rollo was being comforted by the accused.”
The court heard the couple started fighting again when another set of room guests reported the disturbance to reception.
The fiscal added: “When the member of staff attended, they found Ms Rollo in the corridor with a laceration under her left eye and swelling to her thigh. “She was taken to the reception area for first aid and an ambulance was called.”
But she refused to cooperate with police, provide her name or details when questioned by officers about the incident.
MacKinnon appeared at court where pleaded guilty to a charge of assault to injury and permanent disfigurement at the Erskine Bridge Hotel on March 1.
Defence agent Andrew Seggie confirmed his client was accepting responsibility for the charge, but asked to reserve his submission in defence of the accused until after the court had obtained background reports.
Sheriff Lindsey Kooner adjourned matters to call for a Criminal Justice Social Work Report.
MacKinnon of Scotstoun, Glasgow, will learn of his fate on May 28.
SINGAPORE: More than 80 litres of illegally manufactured codeine cough syrup and 32,000 tablets of assorted medicines were  seized from an apartment in Geylang on Wednesday (May 8).
The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said in a statement that the seized tablets included sleeping pills such as midazolam, nitrazepam and diazepam, as well as other prescription medicines including codeine tablets.
The total street value of all items seized was about S$53,000.
HSA said it conducted an enforcement operation in Geylang on Wednesday morning with police officers from the Bedok Police Division following feedback from the public regarding the illegal sale of codeine cough syrup at a coffeeshop near Lorong 20 Geylang.
Surveillance revealed that the illegal products were stored in a nearby apartment.
“Preliminary investigations revealed that the apartment was used to illegally manufacture and store the cough syrup and medicines. These products were intended for illegal sale in Geylang,” HSA added.
During the operation, two men and a woman were caught inside the apartment.
The three suspects, aged between 20 and 28, are currently assisting HSA with investigations into the manufacture and supply of illegal medicines.
Codeine cough syrups are used medically as a cough suppressant.
They are classified as pharmacy-only medicines and can only be supplied by a licensed pharmacist or a licensed medical practitioner, HSA said.
HSA Enforcement Branch Director Annie Tan said cough syrup concoctions made in non-licenced facilities are dangerous and harmful to health as they are produced under poor manufacturing conditions with no proper quality controls.
She advised consumers to purchase such medication from licensed sources such as registered clinics and approved pharmacies.
“Through our close collaboration with the police, we were able to successfully uncover and disrupt this illegal supply of codeine cough syrup, and prevent further harm to the public. HSA will continue to step up our efforts and work with the relevant agencies on raid operations in targeted areas to disrupt the illegal supply of such medicines,” she added.
Those found guilty of importing, manufacturing and/or supplying illegal health products face up to two years’ jail and/or a fine of up to S$50,000.
Members of the public are encouraged to report any illegal activity involving illegal cough syrup and medicines to the Enforcement Branch of HSA.
On Thursday Redmi GM Lu Weibing confirmed -- via a Weibo post -- that Redmi X is not the name of the upcoming Redmi flagship.
This is what he said.
. Back in February this year Redmi General Manager Lu Weibing confirmed that a Snapdragon 855 Redmi phone is coming soon but he did not reveal the name of the phone.
Soon after the existence of the phone was confirmed, rumours started revealing that the Redmi flagship phone will be caked the Redmi X. But looks like the rumours were untrue.
On Thursday Weibing slammed the rumours via a Weibo post and confirmed that Redmi X is not the name of the upcoming Redmi flagship.
In the post, Weibing noted, "not called Redmi X, there will be a better name.."
Previous rumours tipped that the phone could be called Redmi Pro 2.
Well, it could be that or maybe not.
To get the official name of the Redmi flagship we will need to wait for some more days.
The Redmi flagship is tipped to launch on May 14.
As of now, the Redmi phone is rumoured to come to China only and later followed by other markets.
In China, the Redmi flagship is expected to compete against the soon to be launched Realme X. Ahead of the launch, a lot has been revealed about the Redmi flagship.
Firstly, it will be the cheapest Snapdragon 855 phone.
The Redmi flagship is expected to come with three rear cameras, pop-up selfie camera, slim bezels and gradient design.
The Redmi flagship will have no notch on the screen because pop-up camera.
The full specs sheet of the Redmi flagship had also been leaked ahead of the launch.
Let's take a quick look at all the specs of the phone.
The Redmi phone is expected come with a 6.39-inch display, up to 8GB of RAM, up to 128GB storage, 32MP front selfie camera, triple rear camera setup one of which includes a 48MP sensor similar to the Redmi Note 7 Pro.
It is expected that on the back there will be a 48MP primary sensor, 8-megapixel secondary sensor and third one will be a 13-megapixel lens.
Some other rumours suggested that the Redmi Snapdragon 855 powered phone will include an AMOLED panel and an in-display fingerprint sensor.
Some days ago Weibing confirmed that the Redmi flagship phone will come with support for NFC connectivity and 3.5mm headphone jack.
Weibing also said the Redmi flagship will offer powerful performance, great cameras and high screen-to-body ratio.
Some rumours suggest that the Redmi flagship will be the cheapest Snapdragon 855 processor phone yet.
That is probably the reason some rumours are suggesting that this Redmi flagship may hit the Indian market as Poco F2.
However, as of now, there's no official information about the Poco F2.
At least four persons were died and killed on Tuesday evening in Molai and Bukarti villages after gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram attacked the outskirts of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, residents said.
PREMIUM TIMES Tuesday reported an attack by suspected Boko Haram insurgents, who reportedly embedded themselves in a convoy of travellers being escorted by armed soldiers to Maiduguri from Damboa town.
Upon approaching the outskirts of Maiduguri, the insurgents attacked, using a car bomb and several armed men.
They inflicted damages on the convoy and injured some soldiers escorting the travellers.
The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 7, Division of the Nigeria Army, Ibrahim Biu, confirmed the incident in a report by NAN but insisted that the attack was repelled "and Maiduguri was not under attack."
But, from PREMIUM TIMES' findings from residents in Molai, the military commander was not accurate with details of what actually transpired.
Residents speak Bulama Aji, a resident of Molai, confirmed that the attack "did not only inflict grave casualty on civilians but also led to the loss of property for both the residents of Molai and the military."
"They attacked and destroyed "NEPA" (power transmission station) and took away the military gun truck stationed there.
They killed two persons in Maibukarti village, not far away from Molai.
And then, they killed two people in Molai, one of them was a mad man.
"They burnt the entire Molai market and many houses were also torched before the insurgents left ," he said.
Another source in Molai, who did not want to be named, said when the attack started, "even the soldiers took to their heels, that's why the insurgents attacked and easily took away the gun truck stationed at NEPA.
What Army Said In the report published by NAN, the GOC, Mr Biu, said: Troops neutralised a number of the insurgents and repelled the attack.
The insurgents came and fired some shots but troops engaged and repelled them.
Some disgruntled elements are peddling misleading information that Maiduguri is under attack.
How can Maiduguri be under attack when we already repelled them?
They attempted to infiltrate Moloi village in the outskirts of Maiduguri but they were immediately countered. As I speak to you now, I am standing in Molai village. Troops are exploiting the area in hot pursuit of the fleeing insurgents, he said.
Meanwhile, villagers of Molai and Bukarti, who are still concerned about how the insurgents managed to join a military- escorted convoy in such large numbers without being spotted, said they were yet to spot the corpse of a Boko Haram member, which the soldiers claimed they have "neutralised."
The Boko Haram insurgency, now in its tenth year, has claimed thousands of lives and crippled economic activities in more than a dozen local government areas of Borno State.

Murphy, his last alleged victim, is the only one who lived.
In front of jurors on Monday, she described the harrowing ambush she survived more than a decade ago.
It was a Monday in April of 2008.
After work, Murphy washed her bed sheets, jumped rope in the alley behind her Santa Monica apartment complex and watched TV before crawling into bed.
She had been asleep for about an hour, she testified, when she woke up to a man straddling her, stabbing her arm and chest with a serrated knife.
May 01, 2019 | 3:00 AM She screamed and asked why he was attacking her.
The man did not say a word, she said.
In a struggle to save herself, Murphy said she wrapped her hands around the knife’s blade and kicked the man off the bed.
As he ran out the door, Murphy recalled, he spoke for the first time.
“I’m sorry,” the attacker said.
Murphy testified that she locked the door, closed the living room window the man had climbed through to get in and made two phone calls.
She first called the man she had been dating for two months, who is now her husband, and then the police.
An ambulance took her to a hospital, where doctors operated on her hand and stitched her wounds.
She never returned to that Santa Monica apartment.
Instead, her family and friends packed up her belongings.
Since her attack, she said she’s more vigilant about making sure “everything’s locked.” “I’m much more aware of anyone around me,” she testified.
During opening statements last week, Deputy Dist.Atty.
Dan Akemon told jurors that Murphy’s attacker left a trail of blood out her door and past his apartment just across an alley.
Investigators matched the DNA from the blood to that of Gargiulo.
As the prosecutor spoke, Gargiulo, dressed in a purple shirt and tie, frequently leaned over and whispered to his attorney.
As Akemon displayed grisly photographs for jurors, Gargiulo leaned forward and watched the screen attentively, often with his eyebrows raised.
Sometimes, he took notes on yellow legal pad paper.
Gargiulo has been jailed since his arrest in 2008.
The delays in his trial are primarily because he has switched attorneys several times and, for a period of about three years, represented himself.
Akemon told jurors that Gargiulo grew up in a suburb near Chicago, where he played on his high school football team.
He went on to become a husband and a father, working as an air conditioner repairman and a plumber.
“What no one knew for many years is that Michael Gargiulo was leading a double life,” Akemon said, calling Gargiulo the “boy next door killer” because he targeted women who lived nearby.
Akemon said Gargiulo trained in boxing and martial arts.
He considered himself an expert in forensic science and had a penchant for a book that analyzed which body parts to target in a stabbing to be most effective.
After learning the routines and habits of his victims, Akemon said, Gargiulo would “watch, shadow, stalk and hunt down” the women relentlessly as part of his plan to kill.
It began in 1993 in a suburb outside of Chicago.
Years later, Akemon said, he would brag to his friends about killing 18-year-old Tricia Pacaccio.
“I stabbed up the girl,” he told one, Akemon said.
He allegedly told another that he left a victim “on the step for dead.”
After his trial, Gargiulo is expected to be extradited to Illinois, where he is charged with Pacaccio’s slaying.
In Los Angeles, he faces two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder for attacks between 2001 and 2008.
He’s accused of fatally stabbing Ashley Ellerin in 2001 and Maria Bruno in 2005.
During opening statements, Gargiulo’s attorney Daniel Nardoni told jurors that Gargiulo denies killing the three women.
By Sayed Salahuddin May 8 at 9:45 AM KABUL — Heavily armed Taliban fighters stormed the offices of a Virginia-based nonprofit group in central Kabul on Wednesday, sparking a gun battle with security forces that lasted several hours, witnesses said.
Officials said two Afghan civilians were killed and about 20 were hospitalized with injuries.
They also said about 80 people were rescued from the four-story building occupied by Counterpart International, a U.S. government-supported group headquartered in Arlington that promotes leadership, civic engagement and elections in foreign countries.
There was no indication that any foreigners were killed or wounded, and no information as to whether any were in the building when it was attacked.
It was not immediately clear how many attackers were involved and whether any survived.
A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said in an email that the group’s office was targeted because it was engaged in “harmful Western activities” in the country.
Muhajid also said the group had “implemented a dangerous program” that promoted “open inter-mixing between men and women.”
Counterpart’s website says the group has worked in Afghanistan since 2005.
It describes the nonprofit’s mission as working with local partners “to support stronger and more resilient communities by developing leaders, strengthening organizations, and fostering multi-sector community partnerships.”
The attack came days after Taliban insurgents resumed peace talks with U.S. officials in Qatar.
A nationwide gathering of 3,000 Afghans last week called for an immediate cease-fire and an end to the 17-year war, but the Taliban said it had no intention of laying down its arms.

During five years in power, the Taliban movement banned all gender-mixing and prevented women from working or studying outside the home.
Many Afghan women have expressed fears that a peace deal with the Taliban would allow the group to bring back such harsh religious rules.
Wednesday’s attack was the first claimed by the Taliban in Kabul in more than a month, but it came just two weeks after armed men attacked a multi-story government ministry in downtown Kabul.
At least seven people were killed in the attack, and security forces had to evacuate hundreds of office workers before the assailants were slain.
That attack was claimed by the Islamic State.
During Wednesday’s attack, police said one vehicle laden with explosives and possibly driven by a suicide bomber was detonated outside Counterpart’s office in the upscale commercial Shahr-e Now district.
Assailants equipped with rocket-propelled grenades and suicide vests then entered the building, where office employees were busy working.
Several explosions were heard, and clouds of black smoke rose.
Nasrat Rahimi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said security forces rescued 80 employees who were trapped inside.
Roads nearby were cordoned off.
The initial explosion shattered hundreds of windows in nearby buildings.
The United Nations mission in Afghanistan said it condemned “the Taliban’s deliberate targeting of a civilian aid organization.”
The American ambassador in Kabul, John R. Bass, denounced the attack as an act of “senseless violence.”

Two Las Vegas men pleaded guilty Wednesday in Washington to federal conspiracy charges for their role in a scheme to defraud insurance companies through staged car crashes.
Matthew Carter pleaded guilty to four counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, according to the U.S. attorney’s office in Eastern Washington.
Jason Westfall pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.
Carter and Westfall were involved in staged crashes that happened in Las Vegas, but the case is being prosecuted in Washington, where seven other people pleaded guilty Wednesday to their involvement in the scheme.
None of the other defendants were from Las Vegas, but some of the crashes they were linked to happened in Nevada, court records show.
Eleven other people also have been indicted in connection with the scheme.
The staged crashes typically involved a no-fault vehicle and an at-fault vehicle.
Prior to the wrecks, a co-conspirator would purposefully inflict injuries on others to “mislead responders and insurance companies,” court records show.
Involved parties also urinated in a bottle, then poured the urine on their clothing “to create the false and misleading impression that a co-conspirator suffered a loss of consciousness,” according to the records.
Carter was involved in two staged crashes, which happened on June 17, 2015, and November 27, 2017, court records show.
The planned 2015 crash happened at East Post Road and Annie Oakley Drive in the southeast valley while Carter was driving.
The scheme yielded about $286,495, which was split among co-conspirators.
Carter was not driving during the planned 2017 crash, which happened at South Buffalo Drive and West Ford Avenue in the southwest valley.
But one of the involved vehicles was registered to him.
That scheme yielded about $280,016.
After the fraudulently earned payouts from both crashes were split among co-conspirators, Carter took in a total of about $50,500, court records show.
Westfall was involved in one staged crash on Sept. 28, 2014.
It happened at Volunteer Boulevard and Gillespie Street in the far south valley, court records show.
The scheme yielded about $275,607, but Westfall received none of the money.
One of the involved vehicles belonged to him, though, and he knew about the fraudulent insurance claims, according to his plea agreement.
Both men are scheduled to be sentenced June 10.
A father in India left his pregnant 19-year-old daughter and her 23-year-old husband to die after pouring gasoline on the couple and setting them on fire at the beginning of the month over their inter-caste marriage, local news outlets reported Monday.
“According to the police, 23-year-old Mangesh Ransing, and his wife Rukmini (19) were doused in kerosene and set on fire in Ahmednagar’s Nighoj village by three of Rukmini’s relatives — including her father and two uncles — on May 1,” the Hindu reported.
Rukmini Ransing, the daughter, reportedly succumbed to her injuries on May 5 after the shocking incident took place in the Ahmednagar district of India’s state of Maharashtra.
Her husband, Mangesh Ransing, is in life-threatening condition at Pune’s Sassoon General Hospital with severe burn injuries to his face and other parts of the body, the Wire from India revealed.
Against the wishes of Rukmini’s family, the couple married six months ago.
Vijaykumar Botre, the local assistant inspector serving as the investigating officer in the case, indicated to the Hindu that “ Mangesh and Rukmini were married around six months ago amid strong opposition from the girl’s relatives, who vehemently objected to the inter-caste marriage.”
The husband reportedly belongs to Lohar community, considered a nomadic tribe, while the late wife, who originates from Uttar Pradesh, is from a Scheduled Caste called Pashi.
Mangesh’s family told the Wire that local police failed to take action when he repeatedly warned about potential violence and threats at the hands of his wife’s father, who remains at large.
Law enforcement has already arrested two of the female victim’s uncles, Surendra Kumar and Ghanshyam Ranej, who reportedly helped her father commit the crime.
The Wire learned from the male victim’s sister, Priya Ransing, that Rukmini’s mother brought her daughter back to her maternal lured on April 30, a move that ultimately lured the husband there.
Inspector Botre told the Hindu : When Mangesh arrived to take her back the following day, Rukmini’s relatives refused.
A heated altercation ensued after which Mangesh was brutally assaulted by Rukmini’s father and his two uncles.
The trio then doused the newlyweds with kerosene and set them on fire.
Priya told the Wire that Mangesh reached out to police before heading to Rukmini’s maternal home, but they ignored his pleas for help.
She proclaimed: In the evening, Rukmini called my brother and asked him to take her back home.
Mangesh feared for his life, so once again, he approached Nighoj village police and demanded they intervene.
Instead, he was told to sort his family matter on his own.
… The moment Mangesh visited Rukmini’s maternal house on May 1, her father and two uncles overpowered him and beat him up brutally.
They locked the couple in a room, poured petrol on them and set them ablaze.
They were left there to die.
Rukmini’s uncle proceeded to attack the husband with rocks when they realized he was still alive and trying to carry his wife to safety despite his severe injuries.
Inspector Botre told the Hindu the victims’ screams prompted their neighbors to rush them to a nearby hospital.
Priya revealed: On May 1, they were first taken to Ahmednagar Civil Hospital, where doctors told us to take them to Sassoon in Pune as their condition was critical.
Because that day was a holiday, we could not get an ambulance.
On the next day, we got them to Sassoon.
Rukmini died on May 5.
“We did not think that parents can harm their own children,” she declared in disbelief.
Priya surmised that Rukmini’s father had likely planned a second marriage after she married Mangesh or had sold her off to someone within her caste, a long-standing practice in India.
She told the Wire: He had even booked train tickets and wanted to take her there.
Her father had taken Rs 1 lakh [about $1,435] from somebody and wanted to give her away.
Rukmini was asking my brother to arrange Rs 1 lakh to free her.
Rukmini’s family refused to claim her body at the hospital.
“Mangesh’s siblings have demanded strict punishment and want action to be taken against the policemen who did not take his complaint seriously even after repeated pleas,” the Wire noted.
Law enforcement officers allegedly attempted to pin Rukmini’s murder on her husband, an unnamed relative told the news outlet.
“Police kept asking him if he had done something to Rukmini,” the relative claimed.
The Ahmednagar district of India’s Maharashtra is no stranger to caste-related fatalities.
“In 2013, three Dalit youths — Sachin Gharu (24), Sandeep Thanvar (25) and Rahul Kandare (20) — were brutally murdered, and their mutilated body parts scattered in a septic tank and a dried-up well Ahmednagar’s Sonai village,” the Hindu acknowledged.
BIRMINGHAM, AL (WSFA) -- Ten people have been charged in a 103-count indictment alleging hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud in connection to an Alabama-based pharmacy, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama.
The indictments, announced Monday, involve a nurse practitioner, and the owners, a pharmacist, managers, sales representatives, and billers, of Haleyville, Alabama-based pharmacy Northside Pharmacy.
The company was doing business as Global Compounding Pharmacy.
Many of those arrested are from Florida, where Global had a “call center.”
The list of defendants, their connections to the company, and the number of counts they face include:
1. John Jeremy Adams, 38, of Panama City Beach, Florida, an owner and president of Global, charged in 38 counts; Adams was arrested on Wednesday and arraigned on Thursday in the Northern District of Florida.
2. Ashley Adams, 36, of Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, director of HR for Global, charged in 10 counts;
3. Jeffrey Black, 54, of Destin, Florida, an owner and vice president and COO of Global, charged in 18 counts;
4. James A. Mays, III, 43, of Winfield, Alabama, a pharmacist at Global, charged in 20 counts;
5. Jessica Linton, 36, of Clearwater, Florida, the manager of the billing team at Global, charged in 24 counts;
6. Lisa Holmes, 40, of Troy, Alabama, a district manager supervising sales representatives at Global, charged in 12 counts;
7. John Gladden, 49, of Tallahassee, Florida, a district manager supervising sales representatives at Global, charged in 9 counts;
8. Christi Cunningham, aka Christi Mook, 34, of Crestview, Florida, a sales representative at Global, charged in 9 counts;
9. Juan Rodriguez, 41, of Tampa, a biller at Global, charged in 6 counts; and
10. Lori Dawn Edenfield, 45, of Marianna, Florida, a nurse practitioner, charged in 32 counts.
According to the DOJ, the indictment charges the defendants with fraudulently billing health care insurers and prescription drug administrators for over $200 million in prescription drugs.
According to the indictment, Global, which described itself as “one of the top three largest compounding pharmacies in the United States,” primarily shipped compounded and other drugs from its Haleyville facility, but did most of its prescription processing, billing and customer service at its “call center” in Clearwater, Fla.
The company hired sales representatives who were located in various states and were responsible for generating prescriptions from physicians and other prescribers.
The company also worked with affiliated pharmacies.
In one listed instance, the defendants’ alleged fraudulent conduct caused a prescription plan administrator to pay over $29,000 for one tube of a cream advertised as treating “general wounds,” the office of U.S. Attorney Jay Town said.
In other instances, the indictment says insurance companies were billed for female sex creams issued to male patients, billed for drugs issued to children that Global stated were contraindicated for use by children, and billed for drugs that patients did not need and therefore simply discarded in the trash.
“Motivated by greed, the defendants executed a brazen health care fraud conspiracy and scheme that cost health insurance plans, including those that protect the elderly, disabled, military members and veterans, millions of dollars,” Town said.
“Their scheme deprived health insurance plans of money that could have gone to assist patients with real medical needs. To date, this investigation has resulted in 28 people being charged. Would-be healthcare fraudsters should be on notice that our Office is dedicated to rooting out this conduct. We applaud the investigative agencies for their hard work.”
The indictment describes a multi-faceted health care fraud and mail fraud conspiracy and scheme in which the defendants billed for medically unnecessary drugs.
Aspects of the scheme included paying prescribers to issue prescriptions; directing employees to get medically unnecessary drugs for themselves, family members, and friends, to be filled and billed by Global and other related pharmacies; altering prescriptions to add non-prescribed drugs including controlled substances such as Tramadol and Ketamine; automatically refilling prescriptions—often as many as 12 times—regardless of patient need; routinely waiving and discounting co-pays to induce patients to obtain and retain medically unnecessary drugs; and billing for drugs without patients’ knowledge and hiding that conduct from patients by mailing the drugs to J. Adams’ home.
According to the indictment, when prescription drug administrators attempted to police this fraudulent conduct, the defendants evaded and obstructed those efforts, including by providing false information in response to audits and diverting their billing through affiliated pharmacies.
In executing the scheme, the defendants billed health insurance plans and their prescription plan administrators over $200 million and were paid over $50 million.
The indictment states that the defendants targeted multiple health insurance plans, including Global’s, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama, and plans providing health insurance to the elderly, disabled, members of the military, and veterans—Medicare, TRICARE, and CHAMPVA, among others.
In addition, the defendants allegedly targeted the health insurance plans of Medtronic, a medical device company, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., pharmaceutical company, both known by some of the defendants to have high-reimbursing health insurance.
According to the indictment, Adams and Black would hire individuals known to be on Medtronic and Novartis’s health insurance plans, and direct them to get prescriptions for medically unnecessary drugs for themselves, family members, and friends, and then pay them a commission for these prescriptions.
The indictment also charges the defendants with aggravated identity theft, charges J. Adams, Black, and Edenfield with participating in a kickback conspiracy, and charges J. Adams, Black, and Mays with multiple counts of spending the proceeds of health care fraud and mail fraud.
Purchases included for private plane travel and expensive watches.
The charges stem from a larger investigation that has to date resulted in 18 additional individuals being charged and signing plea agreements.
In this copyright infringement case, the court imposed sanctions on specific defendants for their continued discovery abuses.
Specifically, it ordered an adverse inference jury instruction and monetary sanctions for intentional spoliation.
The plaintiffs, collectively “Experience Hendrix,” are the successors-in-interest to Jimi Hendrix’s estate.
They claim that numerous defendants infringed on their copyrights and trademarks by advertising products bearing Hendrix’s name and image.
This spoliation claim specifically concerns those defendants associated with Purple Haze Properties (collectively, “PHP”).
The court had already intervened “dismayingly often” due to PHP’s “persistent non-compliance with basic discovery obligations.”
In this motion, Experience Hendrix requested sanctions for PHP’s spoliation of evidence and “consistent, pervasive, and relentless discovery abuses.”
The court previously ordered PHP to “produce forensic images of ‘every computing device’” associated with their businesses.
This order clarified that “computing devices” included cellphones and tablets as well as laptops and computers.
PHP requested additional time to comply, which the court granted.
However, their initial production included “only the data visibly resident” on the devices rather than their full forensic images.
The court ordered PHP to cure their production.
“Regrettably,” the second production “also proved non-compliant” with the court’s directives, as those images excluded deleted files.
Experience Hendrix had an expert review the images from PHP’s devices.
As a result of that examination, they raised three new issues in their request for sanctions.
First, PHP “ installed and used anti-forensic software on relevant computers” during the litigation.
On two of those computers, individual defendants used the program CleanMyMac to delete files after the lawsuit began.
In fact, one computer had been cleaned during the dispute about forensic imaging.
Andrew Pitsicalis, PHP’s president, directly “ admitted using the program to delete files, including ones…related to Jimi Hendrix.”
Second, Experience Hendrix discovered that PHP had failed to disclose a computer or produce any evidence from it.
While reviewing PHP’s Facebook page, Experience Hendrix saw a picture of Pitsicalis in his office with an iMac desktop computer.
PHP’s counsel stated that he had advised Pitsicalis about his duty to preserve evidence.
Despite that warning, PHP never reviewed or forensically imaged the computer; PHP claimed to no longer have it.
Third, Experience Hendrix learned that Pitsicalis deleted “more than 500 text messages” from his phone while the lawsuit was ongoing.
Nine of those messages “explicitly used the term ‘Jimi.’” Those messages spanned a one-month period beginning the day after the court ordered PHP to provide responsive documents from their devices.
In some of those recovered messages, Pitsicalis “ discussed ways of marketing ‘Jimi’ products” — the very subject of the lawsuit.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(e) gives the court the authority to sanction litigants for spoliation of evidence.
Under that framework, the court “easily” found that PHP was obligated to preserve the spoliated categories of evidence.
Not only had PHP’s counsel advised them of those duties, but the court also “repeatedly issued orders” regarding the preservation of evidence.
Warnings notwithstanding, the court found “overwhelming” evidence that PHP “repeatedly breached this duty” to safeguard relevant evidence.
Instead, they used cleaning software to delete computer files, failed to disclose an entire computer, and deleted relevant text messages.
The court found “every reason to assume” that the cleaned computers previously contained responsive discovery.
Similarly, it concluded that there was “ample circumstantial evidence” indicating that the lost iMac contained responsive materials.
(If it did not, the court noted, PHP was “at liberty to disprove the relevance of the computer’s contents” by recovering it.)
And at least some of the deleted texts “unambiguously referenced Jimi Hendrix” and PHP’s merchandise.
The court further concluded that much of that spoliation was intentional.
Pitsicalis’s deletion of text messages, in particular, was a “willful and blatant violation of the duty to preserve relevant evidence.”
After weighing the available sanctions, the court imposed an adverse inference jury instruction.
It also ordered PHP to pay Experience Hendrix’s attorneys’ fees and costs for the spoliation motion.
While the court “carefully considered” terminating sanctions, it found that “at the present time” they were “not warranted.”
However, further misconduct “could produce a different result,” the court warned.
In a later order, the court awarded a total of $77,633.87 for Experience Hendrix’s fees and costs.
PHP advised the court that “due to the ongoing financial constraints caused by Plaintiffs’ wrongful actions,” they were unable to pay.
In January, they declared bankruptcy.
Mourners hold candles outside the home of 5-year-old Andrew "AJ" Freund on Wednesday, April 24, 2019, in Crystal Lake, Ill.
Andrew's body was found in a wooded area Wednesday morning, and the boy's parents have been charged with his murder.
© John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/TNS CHICAGO - A video of a badly beaten 5-year-old Crystal Lake boy on his mother's cellphone helped crack the investigation into his killing, according to court documents.
The video on JoAnn Cunningham's phone, taken more than a month before Andrew "AJ" Freund's death, showed the boy had severe bruising on his face and body, and was berated for urinating in his bed, the documents alleged.
And his mother allegedly searched online for "child cpr" the night of AJ's death, the documents indicated.
AJ's father, Andrew "Drew" Freund, said the boy was forced to take a long, cold shower and was put to bed "cold, wet, and naked" before being found dead, the documents read.
Those tragic details came out in a sworn statement by McHenry County sheriff's Detective Edwin Maldonado in a request for a search warrant April 24, which was posted in the court file this week.
The parents were charged with AJ's killing, as well as aggravated battery, aggravated domestic battery, failure to report a missing child, and in Freund's case, concealment of a homicide.
Cunningham was also charged with an earlier aggravated battery from on or about March 4 relating to the video.
The parents are being held in McHenry County Jail in lieu of $5 million bail each while awaiting court proceedings.
The statement also alleges that AJ's younger brother told investigators that his mother told him AJ " fell down the stairs and had a lot of owies" while the younger brother was sleeping.
The parents had reported AJ missing the morning of April 18, telling police that they had last seen him when they put him to bed the night before.
But there were no signs of forced entry to the home nor that AJ had left, police said.
The turning point in the investigation described in the affidavit appeared to be when a forensic analysis discovered the video.
The video on Cunningham's phone, dated March 4, showed AJ lying on a bare mattress in his bedroom, with a voice that sounds like Cunningham's "berating AJ for urinating on his bed," according to the affidavit.
AJ is seen to (be) naked except for some small bandages around both wrists and circling his hips, the affidavit stated.
AJ is seen to be holding an ice pack to his face and when he removes it he is seen to have deep red bruising around his eyes, and yellowish-green bruising around his neck and upper chest. It did not appear from the video that AJ received professional medical attention.
When FBI and Crystal Lake police investigators confronted the father with the video at 2:40 a.m.
April 24, Freund blamed AJ's injuries in the video on Cunningham, and then gave an account of what happened the night AJ died, the documents alleged.
Drew also said that he believed AJ died on Monday morning after spending a prolonged time in a cold shower, the affidavit stated.
Drew explained he wanted JoAnn to stop with the hard physical beatings and do some less violent form of punishment.
Drew said cold showers was decided (as the alternative).
Drew said on or about ... 4/15/19, AJ had lied about soiled underwear and he was subjected to a cold shower.
Drew said he helped AJ out of the shower after he'd been there approximately 20 minutes, and put AJ to bed 'cold, wet, and naked.'
Drew said JoAnn got up and checked on AJ and that was when she got Drew and used Drew's phone to search for child cpr.
Drew advised at some point that he believed AJ had died.
Drew said the next day he took AJ's body to the basement and stored him in a tote.
He said on the night of 4/17/19 he placed Andrew inside of several trash bags, placed the body in the trunk of his car, and drove him to an area in Woodstock.
Drew said he dug a shallow grave for AJ, placed him in it, covered it with straw, and left.
Freund then took police to the grave on a vacant property near Woodstock, where they found AJ's body, the documents alleged.
An autopsy determined that AJ died from blunt force trauma to his head.
The house was in hoarder" condition, with garbage bags stacked inside and outside.
Freund's cellphone contained a photo of a handwritten shopping list containing duct tape, plastic gloves, air freshener and bleach, and at least some of those items were found at the house. Freund's shoes had "dripping wet mud" on the bottom and were sent to FBI headquarters in Quantico, Va., for analysis.
Officers found a garbage bag with wet laundry inside that smelled heavily of bleach as well as four empty bleach bottles.
Police also said it appeared that text messages between the parents' phones had been deleted.
Residents in AJ's community held vigils in the boy's honor both while he was missing and after he was found dead.
Mourners have expressed outrage over his death and over previous investigations by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services of alleged abuse, in which the agency failed to ensure the boy was kept safe.
DCFS officials said they are looking into any mistakes that were made in the case.
HIGHLANDS RANCH, Colo. (AP) — When a gunman burs t into his high school classroom, Kendrick Castillo did not hesitate.
The 18-year-old immediately charged, pinning the attacker to the wall before Castillo was fatally shot protecting classmates, witnesses said.
As he charged, so did two other students.
One of them, Brendan Bialy, wrestled the gun from the shooter's hand and the students subdued him.
A second shooter was captured by an armed security guard.
Authorities said these acts of bravery helped minimize the bloodshed from Tuesday's attack, which also wounde d eight people.
We're going to hear about very heroic things that have taken place at the school, Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said Wednesday.
The attackers were identified by law enforcement officials as 18-year-old Devon Erickson and a 16-year-old who prosecutors identified as Maya McKinney but whose attorney said uses male pronouns and the name Alec.
The two allegedly walked into the STEM School Highlands Ranch through an entrance without metal detectors and opened fire in two classrooms.
Because the attack happened only miles from Columbine High School and just weeks after the shooting's 20th anniversary, questions quickly arose about whether it was inspired by the 1999 massacre.
But investigators offered no immediate motive.
Castillo sprang into action against the shooter "and immediately was on top of him with complete disregard for his own safety," said Bialy, a close friend of Castillo's who has signed up to join the Marines.
A member of the school's robotics club and a relentless tinkerer, Castillo had an infectious smile and gentle sense of humor, according to friends.
He worked part-time at a local manufacturing company that had offered him a job after an internship because he was such a standout employee.
To find he went down as a hero, I'm not surprised. That's exactly who Kendrick was , said Rachel Short, president of the company, Baccara.
Cecilia Bedard, 19, had known Castillo since elementary school and said he was always friendly, modest and excited to help people.
He made a point of always joining his father at Knights of Columbus fundraisers and bingo nights.
He was amazing, Bedard said.
He was honestly the sweetest kid I ever met. Never said a mean joke.
Bialy smiled as he recounted the struggle with the shooter to reporters, saying that he wanted to focus on the positive.
They completely and utterly failed in a matter of half a minute, he said of the attackers.
What I saw yesterday was the absolute best of people, he added.
Bialy would not identify the third student who helped subdue the gunman, but the family of Joshua Jones put out a statement saying he was shot twice while disarming one of the attackers.
The security guard who detained the second armed suspect was employed by Boss High Level Protection, a company started by a former SWAT team leader who responded to the Columbine shooting.
The owner, Grant Whitus, told The Associated Press the security guard is a former Marine who ran to the area of the shootings and confronted one of the armed students in a hallway.
The guard drew his weapon and apprehended the person, Whitus said.
He doesn't even realize how many lives he saved by stopping a school shooting, Whitus said.
Both suspects were students at the school, and they were not previously known to authorities, Spurlock said.
Erickson made his first court appearance Wednesday and kept his head down.
His black hair, streaked with purple dye, covered his face as he nodded in response to most of District Court Judge Theresa Slade's questions.
At one point, the judge requested a verbal answer to whether he had any questions about the proceedings.
Erickson simply replied "No."
McKinney, who has a short brown haircut, made eye contact with the judge and answered questions in a clear but quiet voice, saying "Yes, your honor" and "No, your honor."
District attorney George Brauchler said he has not decided whether to file adult charges but added that McKinney is old enough to be charged as an adult without a judge's review.
Formal charges were expected to be filed by Friday.
Brauchler said he could not discuss any motive or weapons used in the attack.
A message left at a phone number listed for Erickson's home was not immediately returned.
Josh Dutton, 18, said he was close friends with Erickson in middle school but had not seen him for four years while attending a different high school.
On Sunday, he spotted Erickson at a local light rail station and said he was shocked at how much his friend had changed.
Erickson wore all black and was significantly thinner and did not seem interested in talking.
He said he'd just turned 18 and he owned rifles, Dutton said.
The shooting took place exactly a week after a gunman killed two students and wounded four at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte.
In that case as well, one of the fatalities was a student who charged the attacker.
The Colorado attack unfolded came nearly three weeks after neighboring Littleton marked the anniversary of the Columbine attack that killed 13 people.
The two schools are separated by about 7 miles (11 kilometers) in adjacent communities south of Denver.
Brauchler said the community remains resilient in the face of multiple shootings, including Columbine, the 2012 theater shooting in the Denver suburb of Aurora and the 2013 shooting at Arapahoe High School.
The attacks are "aberrant acts" although they might seem otherwise to the rest of the world, he said.
Who we are is a kind, compassionate, caring people, and this does not define us.
This story has been updated to correct the name of the student who charged the shooter to Joshua Jones, instead of Jason Jones.
A PASSENGER spotted carrying a rucksack from a plane crash which left at least 41 dead in Russia later demanded a refund, it has been reported.
Dmitry Khlebushkin was identified in hours after he was pictured walking away from the scene of the disaster carrying his backpack and later tried to get the cost of his ticket back.
Screams of terror could be heard from the inside the cabin of the burning jet after it crash landed on Sunday evening in Moscow.
Unconfirmed reports stated some passengers blocked the escape of those trapped at the back of the burning plane by stopping to collect their overhead luggage.
Airline emergency rules clearly state passengers must leave all their baggage on board.
Khlebushkin had praised the stewardesses for help in evacuating the plane.
“It was dark, the temperature was high, they were pulling people out of there. They helped people to go down the slide," he said. But then he is reported to have told Life online news: “I failed to get a refund for my ticket for 40 minutes. And in the end I did not get it at all."
Reports say only three passengers behind Mr Khlebushkin - who was reportedly sitting in seat 10C - managed to flee the plane.
It has not been confirmed whether or not he was aware of the numbers in the rows behind him who perished.
Aviation online forum Forumavia posted: “On the video we see the first passenger jumping out taking four seconds.”
“The second is that overweight man who was angry that he could not get a refund… from 10C seat. ”
This is Dmitry Khlebushkin. He saved his backpack.
"And he is looking really great, knowing that everyone further back than the 11th row died ."
Only 37 passengers survived the inferno on Sunday night The Russian Investigative Committee said in a statement: "There were 78 people on board, including five crew members. According to updated information, 37 out of them survived ."
The severely charred remains of six men and one woman will be identified using DNA.
They were named as: Vitaly Velmakin, 40, Alexander Vitsnarovsky, Petr Kiselev, Albina Pilipchuk, Sergey Plotnikov, 46, Alexey Smirnov and Valentin Khomchenko.
The youngest fatality in the Moscow air tragedy was Sofia Novikova, 12, who died alongside her doctor father, 40-year-old Evgeny Novikov.
The pair had been on holiday together when they perished in the Sukhoi Superjet inferno.
Sofia had called her mother, Ksenia Novikova, 34, an English language teacher, to say: “Mum, we’re taking off.”
When she heard about the crash on TV, Ksenia rushed to the airport in the family’s home city of Murmansk where she learned that her daughter and husband had both died.
Also killed was Alyona Martynova, a senior official with Murmansk regional government.
Flight attendant Maxim Moiseev was said to have been killed while saving his passengers from the blaze, REN TV reported.
Stewardess Tatyana Kasatkina kicked open the plane's emergency exit Footage showing survivors emerging carrying bags and coats shows how passengers “cost lives” because those stranded at the rear of the plane could not get out, said unnamed experts cited by Vesti.ru.
The rear emergency doors were not accessible because of the blaze.
It was revealed how a hero stewardess pushed passengers out of the burning plane while escape routes were blocked by people grabbing luggage from overhead lockers.
Harrowing footage shows flames licking at the plane's windows as it was engulfed in a huge fireball.
Other footage appears to show the rear of the jet consumed by flames even before the crash landing at Sheremetyevo airport just 28 minutes after takeoff.
Desperate passengers were filmed escaping down emergency chutes and sprinting away, some holding their luggage - as officials claimed the evacuation was hindered by those stopping to grab their bags.
Stewardess Tatyana Kasatkina, 34, revealed how she kicked the plane’s door open and physically pushed passengers out onto the emergency slide to safety.
“When the plane stopped, the evacuation immediately began ,” she said.
“Everyone was shouting that we were on fire. But there was no fire inside the cabin at this moment. “I kicked the door out with my leg and pushed out the passengers so as not to slow the evacuation. “Just to hurry them up I grabbed each of them by the collar from the back."
The emotional stewardess added: “It was all so quick. The smoke was already black. The last people were crawling to get out."
Survivors have praised the heroic cabin crew rescued them from the flaming wreckage. Dmitry Khlebnikov said: “I thank God - and the stewardesses who saved me. “They were always with us, helping people to climb the slide and get out of the cabin full of smoke. It was dark and incredibly hot inside.”
Russian plane makes emergency landing at Moscow airport after fire breaks out on board Sofia Novikova, the youngest fatality in the Moscow air tragedy The front of the plane looks virtually intact The aircraft made an emergency landing at around 6.40pm Moscow time on Sunday after bursting into flames mid-air The two-year-old Sukhoi Superjet was forced to make the landing shortly after taking off for the Arctic city of Murmansk at 6.03pm local time.
A distress signal was issued before the radio connection failed just minutes into the flight.
Witnesses filmed the rear of the plane engulfed in flames and black smoke as it touched down at the airport and sped along the runway ablaze.
One passenger revealed: "I was sitting in front of the engine, and saw how everything melted. "Somehow I managed to reach the exit, inhaling carbon monoxide.
The flight attendants said: Come on, quickly, crawl, a little bit left until the exit. As a result, I managed to jump off the plane.
New Delhi: The mysterious disappearance of a 22-year-old youth, Ajay Kumar, who had gone missing on April 28 from near his house in Narela, has been solved by Crime Branch of Delhi Police.
He was murdered by three youths from his locality who were bullied by him, police said.
Kumar had allegedly thrashed two youths from the neighbourhood after getting drunk on Holi.
He also used to often mock them.
On April 27, after Kumar again thrashed one of them, the three youths hatched a conspiracy to kill him.
The youths abducted him from a market where he had gone shopping with his mother on April 28.
They tied Kumar and dumped him in the boot of their vehicle and drove to Kundli-Ghaziabad Peripheral Expressway at night.
They took him out at an isolated spot and kept thrashing him for 20 minutes and then choked him to death.
The killers disfigured his face with stones to make identification of the body difficult.
Kumar’s mother informed police about the kidnapping around 6pm on April 28.
In her complaint, she said that she and her son had gone to the market to buy milk and groceries.
Kumar was standing outside the shop when two men dragged him into a car.
She screamed for help, but no one came forward and the kidnappers sped away.
Later, she identified one of them as Mohit from her neighbourhood.
An FIR of kidnapping was registered at Narela police station.
Mohit was found absconding from his house.
Police started a probe to find others who had rivalry with the victim and their movements matched the location from where Kumar was kidnapped.
On Wednesday morning, DCP (Crime Branch) Joy Tirkey’s team received a tip-off about one of the suspects, Rohit alias Bhupender.
A team comprising ACP Arvind Kumar and inspector Mukesh Antil from the special operations squad (SOS-I) laid a trap near a temple in the area and arrested them.
Raids are on to nab their associates who have supposedly fled to Haryana and Delhi outskirts.
The incident is similar to the murder of a youth reported from Sainik Farms two weeks ago.
Six youths got together and killed one Surjit Kashyap (22), who allegedly bullied them.
The accused had been nursing the grudge for two years.
TORONTO — Andrew Kinsman, the last of eight men to be killed by Bruce McArthur, shared a keen interest in serial killers before becoming a victim of one himself.
Police found movies, drawings and writings about notorious serial killers who targeted gay men or raped male victims on Kinsman’s computer equipment and a friend suggested Kinsman may have discussed the psychology of serial killers with McArthur.
New passages within almost 6,000 of pages of Toronto police documents detailing years of effort to track missing men who disappeared from the city’s gay village from 2010 to 2017 were unsealed by a judge Monday.
Much of the detailed investigative summaries had previously been unsealed with large sections blacked out to protect McArthur’s right to a fair trial.
A legal challenge by Postmedia and other media companies — as well as McArthur’s guilty pleas to eight counts of first-degree murder in January — led Ontario judge Cathy Mocha to release new portions that can now be revealed.
Much of the material deals with police failures to find the missing men or evidence of their murders in an aborted early investigation and then details the growing evidence against McArthur in a second probe, including information on what he did to his victims after they were killed.
Among the information police gathered on the men McArthur targeted is Kinsman’s interest in serial killers with similar profiles as McArthur’s.
Police interviewed a manager with Toronto People With AIDS Foundation on Oct. 11, 2017, according to one summary of the police investigation after Kinsman was reported missing.
Police were told that over the Christmas holidays, she and Kinsman were filling holiday bags to give clients when Kinsman told her he had a relationship with a man who, like him, was “very into the psychology of serial killers and how they functioned .” “They really enjoyed talking about it,” she told police.
Kinsman did not reveal the man’s name but said they got together for “hook ups” every month or so.
Kinsman is known to have had sexual encounters with McArthur before his murder.
Kinsman also liked reading books on serial killers, police were told, but his interest went further than that, according to a search of computer equipment police found in Kinsman’s apartment.
In a hard drive partition labeled “pictures/murder” were various drawings and writing related to Dennis Andrew Nilsen, a convicted serial killer in England.
The similarities between McArthur and Nilsen are striking.
Both were seemingly respectable men who preyed on vulnerable gay men, befriending potential victims and luring them to their home; both men strangled their victims and both dressed and undressed their victims’ dead body before cutting them up.
(The police documents say police found several photographs of McArthur’s dead victims dressed and posed in the same fur coat, sometimes also with a fur hat and an unlit cigar dangling from their lips.)
Nilsen was convicted in London, England, of six murders and two attempted murders in 1983 but is believe to have killed at least 15 young men.
Nilsen died of natural causes last May while serving a life sentence.
He was 72.
Also in the partition on Kinsman’s drive was a documentary movie on serial killer John Wayne Gacy, an American who killed 33 young men and teenaged boys in the 1970s who also has similarities to McArthur.
Gacy was known by the stage name Pogo the Clown because he dressed in a costume and makeup to entertain children.
McArthur also donned a colourful suit to delight children — he worked for several years before his arrest as a shopping mall Santa at Agincourt Mall in Scarborough.
Kinsman also had an interest in the type of rough sex McArthur was into, police documents show.
In the same partition, labeled “pictures/homeporn and other”, police found photos of Kinsman engaged in a sex act with an unknown man; the man is blindfolded in some photos and his hands bound behind his back in some.
“A noose is visible,” police note.
He also had a series of photos of himself appearing to be eating a glass bottle and bleeding all over his naked body.
The document notes the photos, “appear to be staged” and taken in 2013.
In the same partition, labeled “pictures/bruce”, officers found 12 photos or McArthur.
All were portraits of the killer taken outside in a garden on Sept. 11, 2010, using a Nikon D2X camera, the same model camera police found in Kinsman’s apartment.
Other revelations in the documents outlining the two police probes, the first called Project Houston and the second called Project Prism, include: • McArthur’s friends and family investigated as possible accomplices: Once McArthur was deemed to be the killer they were looking for, Toronto police investigated several people he was close to in case any had knowingly helped him in his horrific deeds.
“During the course of the investigation a number of McArthur’s friends and family members were identified and the possibility was explored that they could have participated with him in the offences alleged,” the documents say.
Search warrants were even executed at some of their homes.
Among those police checked out were: an on-again, off-again boyfriend of McArthur’s; McArthur’s roommate at the Thorncliffe Park two-bedroom apartment where many of his murders took place; his son, Todd McArthur; McArthur’s daughter Melanie Prodan and her husband Michael Prodan; Roger Horan, one of McArthur’s best friends; and McArthur’s former wife, Janice McArthur.
A Stillwater man has been charged with first degree burglary, threatening to kill and assault and battery stemming from an incident that occurred on Tuesday.
Eduardo Gonzalez Pulido, 44, of Stillwater, was charged on Wednesday, according to court records.
A written affidavit states that the victim reported an assault at a residence on Crested Butte Drive, in which seven people came into his house and he was choked and assaulted.
Dispatch then advised that the victim had been able to get into his bedroom where he had a shotgun while the intruders were yelling at his roommates.
Another officer who responded  saw a white, two-door vehicle driving from the area that was overloaded with eight people.
Officers stopped the vehicle, and talked to the occupants briefly, receiving varying answers about where they were coming from and where they were going.
Officers at the scene of the assault were contacted, and more information made the officers believe the occupants of the vehicle were involved, according to the affidavit.
The victim reported hearing a loud knock on the door, and opened the door as a man barged in.
The man then grabbed him by the throat and pushed him against the wall while several other people followed into the apartment.
The victim struggled to break free, but the suspect pushed him to the ground, still pushing against his throat.
The man told him “it’s judgment day mother f-----” and “I’m your worst nightmare” and “Threaten my girl again,” according to the affidavit.
The victim eventually broke free and ran to his bedroom, locking the door and contacting police.
The victim said he had never before seen the man who assaulted him, and believed the man intended to kill him.
The victim was taken to the scene of the traffic stop, where he identified one of the occupants as the man who assaulted him and made threats to him, according to court records.
Pulido was placed into custody and transported to jail, where he was processed and charged with first-degree burglary, assault and battery and making threats to kill.
R. Kelly's attorney has given a $62,000 check to the singer's ex-wife to bring Kelly's child support payments up to date.
The Chicago Sun-Times reports that the payment was made during a hearing Wednesday in Chicago.
It comes weeks after Kelly was locked up because he hadn't paid more than $161,000 that he owed.
He was released from jail days later after he raised the money.
The issue of Kelly's back child support came up after he was charged in February with 10 counts of sexual abuse pertaining to three girls and one woman.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Earlier Wednesday, another judge ordered a default judgment against Kelly to be vacated and allowed that lawsuit to proceed.
It was brought by one of the four accusers.
The judge restored the lawsuit after one of Kelly's attorneys explained that the singer never responded to being served because he's illiterate and couldn't read the documents.
A judge who ordered a default judgment against R. Kelly after the singer failed to respond to a lawsuit filed by one of his alleged victims now says the suit can proceed.
The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Cook County Judge Moira Johnson on Wednesday reinstated the lawsuit after Kelly's attorneys said the singer never responded to it because he's illiterate and couldn't read the documents when he was served with them.
The lawsuit was filed by a woman identified as "H.W.," who is one of the four women that Kelly is charged in a criminal case with sexually abusing.
She contends she began a sexual relationship with Kelly in 1998, when she was 16.
Kelly is scheduled to appear at another hearing Wednesday in his unrelated child support case.
CARACAS- Agence France-Presse Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro warned on April 30 that those responsible for a military uprising against him would face "criminal prosecutions." "This will not go unpunished," Maduro said in an address broadcast on television and the radio.
I have spoken to the attorney general. I have chosen three prosecutors who will interrogate all people involved and they will launch criminal prosecutions for the serious crimes that have been committed against the constitution, the rule of law and the right to peace.
Demonstrators clashed with police on the streets of the Venezuelan capital on April 30, spurred by opposition leader Juan Guaido's call on the military to rise up against Maduro- who also said he had defeated an attempted coup.
An apparently carefully planned attempt by Guaido to demonstrate growing military support disintegrated into rioting as palls of black smoke rose over eastern Caracas.
Maduro declared victory over the uprising- congratulating the armed forces for having " defeated this small group that intended to spread violence through putschist skirmishes."
Guaido had been immediately backed by the United States, where President Donald Trump said in a tweet Washington was standing behind the Venezuelan people and their "freedom."
He rallied his supporters with an early morning video message that showed him for the first time with armed troops he said had heeded months of urging to join his campaign to oust Maduro.
Guaido claimed the move was the "beginning of the end" of Maduro's regime, and there was "no turning back." "We showed there are soldiers willing to defend the constitution, and there are many more," he said in a video message on April 30.
Thousands of opposition supporters flocked onto a highway near the air base, many waving Venezuelan flags, but they were met with gunfire and tear-gas fired by soldiers at the compound's perimeter.
Lopez later entered the Chilean embassy with his wife and one of his children to claim asylum, before moving to the Spanish embassy, Chile's Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero announced in Santiago.
Soldiers backing Guaido wore blue armbands to demonstrate their allegiance to the opposition leader- recognized as interim president by more than 50 countries- but there appeared to be few of them.
Brazil said later a number of Venezuelan troops had sought asylum at its Caracas embassy.
Brazilian media put that number at 25.
But Maduro had called on his forces to show "nerves of steel" and troops in riot gear, backed by armored vehicles and water tankers, lined up against the demonstrators.
Several vehicles plowed into the crowd, injuring some of the protesters.
Rioters later blocked the highway with a bus and set it on fire.
A plume of black smoke rose from an area near a helicopter hangar on the base, where demonstrators who briefly managed to enter were pushed back.
As United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to all sides to avoid violence, Venezuela's army chief and defense minister, General Vladimir Padrino issued a stark warning of possible "bloodshed"- adding that he would hold the opposition responsible.
He later said an army colonel had received a bullet wound to the neck during the clashes in Caracas.
Health officials said 69 people were injured, including two from bullet wounds.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN he believed Maduro was ready to flee to ally Cuba before he was dissuaded by Russia- a claimed Maduro later refuted.
Speaking late on April 30 to business executives in Washington, Pompeo voiced hope that Maduro would still choose exile in the coming days.
Moscow, Maduro's main backer and creditor alongside China, accused Guaido of "fueling conflict" in the oil-rich country.
Maduro's leftist Latin American allies Bolivia and Cuba also condemned Guaido.
Trump threatened a "full and complete embargo" and tougher sanctions against Cuba if it does not end military support for Venezuela.
Have you ever seen Detroiters ?
Man, that show was unbelievable!
Seriously, it might be the best new half-hour television comedy of the last 10 years.
That’s up for debate, of course, but it was hilarious.
How did Detroiters only last two seasons before getting cancelled, but Comedy Central keeps renewing Tosh.0 and other bottom-of-the-barrel bullshit without a second thought?
So dumb.
And sure, Tim Robinson’s new sketch show on Netflix is good too, but it’s got nothing on Detroiters .
It just needed one more season to find an audience.
Sadly, that will never happen.
It’s a travesty.
Why are we talking about this?
Oh yeah!
So there’s a scene in an episode of Detroiters —an incredible show that Comedy Central foolishly cancelled after just two seasons because they’re idiots—where Jim Harbaugh makes a cameo.
In that scene of the absolutely misunderstood series that had limitless possibilities, the hot-tempered Michigan coach tries his hand at “fowling,” a combination of football and bowling.
It actually looked like a lot of fun.
Anyway, we’re letting you know all this because 1. Detroiters was the best and more people need to know about it, and 2. Wauwatosa will soon be home to the area’s first dedicated “Football Bowling” establishment.
Milwaukee Record has learned that 1st And Bowl is coming to metro Milwaukee.
The business was reportedly eyeing a spot in Milwaukee’s Harbor District last year.
However, 1st And Bowl will be opening at 2969 N. 114th St, Wauwatosa, which is situated just across from the Mayfair Collection.
According to the forthcoming football bowling bar’s Facebook page , 1st And Bowl is expected to open this summer.
Check back for updates on 1st And Bowl.
And pour one out for Detroiters .
The United States is in the midst of a record-setting measles outbreak.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 760 individuals across 23 states have contracted measles this year—the “greatest number of cases reported in the US since 1994 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000.”
In light of this national health crisis, Mother Jones spoke with Sean O’Leary, a Colorado-based doctor specializing in pediatric infectious disease, who was, as he says, “on the front lines” of conversations with parents about vaccines as a former primary care pediatrician beginning in 1999.
He has also conducted research in identifying and addressing barriers to vaccination.
Here O’Leary tells us , in his own words, about his experiences: how he’s seen parents in recent years come to expect to collaborate with doctors on their children’s medical care and how that practice may lead to fewer vaccinations.
What he’s talking about is known as “shared decision making,” and research shows that asking open-ended questions like, “What do you think about Johnny’s shots today?” is less effective in getting parents to vaccinate their children than the “presumptive approach,” in which the language used assumes the child will be vaccinated: “Johnny has some shots today.”
While it’s not totally clear how big of a role provider-parent interactions play in vaccination rates across the country, O’Leary posits that almost every doctor currently deals with parents who expect to weigh in and collaborate on their child’s care.
As O’Leary explains to Mother Jones, he’s experienced the difference in the two approaches first hand— and he knows how these conversations can be stressful, and even confrontational.
But, he says, they’re crucial.
When I was first starting in general pediatric practice, there was a day I was going to see a four- or five-year-old child.
It was my first time seeing him.
But when I looked through his chart, I didn’t see any vaccines.
I thought, “Well, that’s weird. They must just not have the record.”
When I went into the room— and I remember the guy well—there was this dad.
He was an engineer.
I went through the regular visit with him and then I said, “Oh, you know, I didn’t find any vaccines in here. Do you have a copy of the shot records?”
He said, “Oh, no, we don’t vaccinate.”
And he brought out this notebook with Excel spreadsheets.
He had graph paper with his handwriting.
And he had done, essentially, his own analysis of a lot of the different vaccines.
He tried to convince me of why vaccines didn’t work and why they were a bad idea.
And I was just completely taken aback.
I had been trained in medical school and residency about the benefits of vaccines and I knew that these recommendations came from people who devoted their lives to studying these things, using the scientific method.
I came out of there shaking, I was so angry.
That was the first example [of an instance where I encountered a parent denying the science of vaccines].
With time, I certainly mellowed in my approach.
And I came to recognize that there’s a spectrum of people around vaccines.
The vast majority of parents are accepting of vaccines—you just say, “It’s time for the shots,” and they get them.
Then there’s a percentage of people that just have questions.
And Then, there are these rabid anti-vaccination parents like this guy.
In my practice, with the infant series of vaccines, we took a “presumptive” approach all along: They would come in and it would go without saying that it’s a 2-4-6 month visit [per the recommended screening and assessment schedule for newborns].
Then the nurse would come in and do your shots.
And I think that’s how a lot of practices worked.
We didn’t even think about it back then.
I started medical school in 1992, and  then a residency in 1996.
And  Then went into general pediatric practice in 1999.
It was an era when the internet was becoming more and more a tool for health information.
In the early 2000s, that’s when I started to see [misinformation].
It was not just about vaccines, but about whatever.
People would print stuff that they had found on the internet.
Once social media platforms became more commonly used, it just really fueled that spread of misinformation.
It was also around the time that adolescent vaccines were coming into routine use—Tdap, the meningococcal vaccine, and then the HPV vaccine.
And some of that is maybe coincidental, and some of it is also potentially related.
But that’s where you had to mention it to the parents and to the adolescent: “There are these shots we’re going to be doing today.”
And that’s where I first recognized as a clinician, I’m not going to ask about this, I’m just going to say it because I get less resistance when I do that.
The “presumptive” approach is something I think a lot of people have already been doing, but for those that aren’t, we now have evidence that it is effective.
“ Shared decision making” is really intended for preference-sensitive decisions—places where there’s no clear medical treatment, no clear correct medical decision.
For example, in making a decision between open heart surgery or using a catheter.
But where there’s a clear medical indication for an intervention, that’s not really an appropriate place for shared decision making.
And vaccines fit squarely in that space.
The benefits of vaccines greatly outweigh the risks and they’re in the best interest of the child.
For doctors, talks with hesitant parents are difficult conversations.
We found in a study in 2011 that when pediatricians do encounter parents with questions about vaccines, about half of them report spending more than 10 minutes [explaining the science].
The average “well-child” visit is about 18 minutes long in the US, so if we’re spending more than half the time talking about what is really the most evidence-based thing we do in pediatrics, that’s a real problem.
And as a pediatrician, this is a fairly common occurrence.
There is no debate in the scientific community about whether or not the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks.
And so when you’re having to spend all this time explaining something that should be just a complete no-brainer, it can be very frustrating.
Bruce Springsteen spent all of 2018 turning an acoustic one-man show into a massive Broadway residency.
He ended the year by releasing a Netflix special and a live album.
And when he finally finished that run, there was rampant speculation that he’d kick off another massive, stadium-sized tour with the E Street Band, the rock institution he’d led since 1972.
There was so much speculation, in fact, that Springsteen had to release a statement denying that there’d be an E Street Band tour in 2019.
Instead, Springsteen announced Western Stars, a solo album inspired by the folky California pop music of the ’60s and ’70s.
(He also shared the lovely single “Hello Sunshine.”)
But now he’s also gone ahead and said that, yes, there will be another E Street Band album, the first since 2012’s Wrecking Ball.
And yes, there will be a tour, too.
Last night, Springsteen did an appearance in Hollywood with fellow ’70s great Martin Scorsese.
The talk was ostensibly to remind Emmy voters that they should show some love to Springsteen On Broadway .
But as Variety reports, he also came bearing news.
While talking about the nature of songwriting and inspiration, Springsteen said this: It’s like I’ve spent about seven years without writing anything for the band.
I couldn’t write anything for the band.
And I said, “Well, of course… You’ll never be able to do that again!”
And it’s a trick every time you do it, you know?
But it’s a trick that, because of that fact that you can’t explain, cannot be self-consciously duplicated.
It has to come to you in inspiration.
And  Then about a month or so ago, I wrote almost an album’s worth of material for the band.
And it came out of just… I mean, I know where it came from, but at the same time, it just came out of almost nowhere.
Then it was good, you know.
I had about two weeks of those little daily visitations, Then it was so nice.
It makes you so happy.
You go, “Fuck, I’m not fucked, all right? There’ll be another tour!”
If you’ve never seen the E Street Band live — or, hell, if you’ve seen them dozens of times — this is delightful news.
An E Street Band show is something that you should absolutely witness at least once in your lifetime.
It’s fucking ridiculous how good it is.
We shouldn’t expect the album or the tour for a long while, but we might as well start getting excited now.
In the meantime, Western Stars is out 6/14 on Columbia.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) reported earnings last night and investors sold it on the headline.
It’s not like they delivered a bad report card; QCOM beat both sales and earnings expectations.
But the company committed the cardinal sin of earnings reports and guided lower because of weakness in their China business.
These days Wall Street is so obsessed with the forecast that management reports for future quarters that it’s almost like they don’t care about the actual results.
So in theory, investors are punishing the companies that like to under promise and over deliver.
Luckily for the bulls, coming into the earnings event, Qualcomm stock was near an all-time high and close to its Dot Com bubble level.
It came into it up 52% year-to-date, which is double that of the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ ).
So the price action setup favored the downside scenario.
In fact, I actually shorted the event via a put position.
This wasn’t a knock against the company’s prospects but rather betting on the binary event reaction.
QCOM management is competent so I knew they would beat the expectations.
But I felt that the prices demanded perfection from the report.
Before you label me a hater, I wrote about going long QCOM stock as it showed relative strength in early March.
The trade paid very well so I am not a perma-bear.
I trade around the price action.
So is it a good place to catch the falling knife?
Not yet.
Recently, the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) settlement headline caused an insane rally in QCOM stock.
The downside of having had that spike is that it sets up the potential for serious disappointment.
Those who recently bought the rally are weak hands and they will sell out of their positions very fast at the first sign of trouble.
So there is not a strong footing anywhere near these levels, even after the dip on the headline.
There is very delicate support around $80 per share, but then there is the pull from a massive gap to $71 per share.
Although this is not a forecast, this dip could target filling the gap.
This is a viable scenario that could unfold here, especially if the markets continue to fall like they did Wednesday afternoon.
The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spooked equity investors as he refused to commit to cutting rates.
This is a silly request from the traders, nevertheless, it caused real price action.
So if the tizzy lingers, then the QCOM stock dip will too.
This also depends on the trader time frame.
If the intent is to own QCOM shares for a really long time, then you can nibble down 5%.
But for most traders who prefer starting out green, I’d wait out the first down candle, especially when it’s this big.
The fundamentals are relatively healthy for QCOM.
But the stock is not cheap as it sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 56X.
So there is a bit of froth it can shed.
But we learned that the company will get about $4.5 billion from Apple, so that should go a long way toward supporting the stock price action this week.
Technically, there should be support before QCOM stock fills the gap below; $76 per share was pivotal from last September, so it should provide support on the way down.
Both bulls and bears will want to fight it out hard thereby creating price congestion.
In the long run, QCOM stock will rise with the stock market.
This is a successful company that just settled its dispute with the largest company on the planet.
And it will continue to be successful.
So there is no reason to short QCOM’s future and the stock will recover after the earnings tizzy is done.
The better entry points into the stock would be at pivot zones and those are at $80, $76 or $68.
PHILADELPHIA — The question, as Brett Brown likes to acknowledge, was fair.
The timing was perfect.
The response was measured enough that it resonated.
The 76ers had just defeated the Toronto Raptors, 116-95, to boost their control of this NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.
Joel Embiid had played 28:09, scored 33 points, was a plus-31, gathered 10 rebounds and made five blocked shots.
For a flourish, he provided a Dr. J. dunk, as the Raptors, disinterested by then and being laughed at by 20,658, just rolled out of his way.
So Brown was asked whether, when Embiid plays that way, the Sixers have the best player in the series.
A second went by.
But not two.
“Yes,” Brown said.
Yes, of course.
Left unsaid in that exchange was that the other candidate, the one Brown has called “true NBA royalty,” a visitor from his ever-referenced previous life as a San Antonio Spurs assistant, was Kawhi Leonard.
He had 33 points, too.
And for him, those 33 points were, by recent context, an off night.
For hadn't Leonard scored 45 points in Game 1 and 35 in Game 2?
So those were the major-party candidates, Embiid and Leonard.
And as it must be whenever the question is posed as it was, the answer had to be Embiid.
That's because, when at his best, Embiid is the best player in the series … and the best player the Sixers have ever employed.
That asterisk obviously glows, the hedge about Embiid being at his best.
Too frequently, Embiid is not available at all, either due to real pain or the kind the franchise's sports scientists endeavor to have him avoid.
But the way Embiid can dominate a game from every position on the floor, from baseline to baseline, defensively and offensively, as a foul shooter, in the paint and from the business side of the arc, there has never been anything like him in a 76ers uniform.
So as Brown's team has moved to within 10 victories of one of those Cottman-Frankford carry-ons, the appreciation of Embiid grows.
And his effort in Game 3, against a team that hired a center specifically to neutralize him, with higher-than-usual stakes considering how willing the owner and the general manager are to make faces should their team not experience a third playoff round, Embiid did not as much provide a boxscore line as an iron mallet.
Bang.
There it was Thursday night, the entire show in one compact appearance … and the reason the Sixers can win much more than a playoff series against the befuddled Toronto Raptors.
“For me it goes straight to the blocks,” Brown said afterward.
“We can talk about a windmill dunk. You can talk about some finesse post moves and that. But I go to defense. That’s what interests me the most to date with this series. When we talk about whatever we’re going to talk about, my mind goes straight there. “He is our crown jewel defensively, and I suppose offensively, too. But certainly defensively. And his rim protection and blocking shot ability tonight stood out as much to me as anything in an incredible performance.”
Rim protection at one end.
Three-for-four three-point shooting at the other.
Strength inside.
Speed in the open floor.
No other Sixer has ever had that depth of basketball skill.
Nor does Kawhi Leonard, as dangerous a scorer that he might yet prove to be with as many as four games remaining in the series.
And that's where the forecasts of Sixers doom were a bit off prior to the series.
Even among those viewing the matchup as competitive, the consensus was that Toronto had the best player.
That's close.
But it's inaccurate.
The Sixers have the best player.
Should they win six more times and likely confront Kevin Durant in the NBA Finals, that will change.
But along with his end-to-end dominance, the Sixers' center is producing staggering statistics.
Since 2009, only Embiid and Durant have had at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and five snuffs in a playoff game.
Durant did it once, Embiid twice.
When Embiid supplied at least 30 points and 10 rebounds in less than 30 minutes Thursday, he was the first to do so in the playoffs since Kevin McHale in 1990.
And in 15 career postseason games, Embiid has a dozen double-doubles, a Sixers first.
“He played great,” Leonard said.
“He made his presence felt. He got to the free-throw line, hit some big threes, had five blocks. “You know, he did his job.”
The Sixers are a unique team, making them difficult to characterize.
Most of their better players thrive at multiple positions.
And though Embiid is their best player, Butler is their leader.
That's an NBA oddity, but it works.
In large part, it works because Embiid makes it work, ever prepared to mix joy in with his dominance.
“I want to have fun,” he said.
“My game just changes. You know, I’m always told that if I don’t smile during the game, I’m either having a bad game or I’m not into it. “We all have fun as a team. You know, you can see it lifts my teammates and we all do a good job.”
Rested late in the season, slimmed some after his return, still experiencing some knee pain but improving, Embiid did more than a good job in Game 3.
The best player in the series did the best job.
“Cuppy cake” rejoice!
In the world of fashion today, big change: replaced long-legged skinny folk came plus size girls, that is “body”.
They are not ashamed of their cellulite and folds on the stomach and are increasingly appearing on the covers of fashion magazines.
By the way, these women (with sagging bellies and “breeches” on the thighs) much admired by the Renaissance artists.
Especially lovingly write them out Titian and Rubens.
How varied standards of beauty, and what he had to go to the fashionistas of different ages, found out the correspondent channel “WORLD 24”.
Meet this impressive size the woman’s name is Venus of Willendorf.
The statuette, made in the 23rd century BC, was found on the territory of modern Austria.
The work of the ancient masters shows: our ancestors chose the ladies in the body.
Similar standards of beauty were in the Renaissance.
Great artists have portrayed women with a tummy and cellulite, they were considered the embodiment of wealth and happiness.
And the ladies were glad to try: to become a Muse of Titian and Rubens, actively ate fatty butter and sour cream.
And in the middle ages not only plucked eyebrows, and even eyelashes.
Then the standard of beauty was that the girl should be high, rounded forehead and a minimum of facial hair.
To form the “right” traits, girls had their hair shaved off the forehead.
Now this image would call the consequences of severe rickets.
In Ancient Greece, on the contrary, the fashion was the unibrow.
It was considered a sign of aristocratic descent.
Girls who have not had a chance to have that kind of nature, tried to draw it with charcoal and even pasted on the forehead of the villi from bird feathers.
Psychologists confirm the veracity of the joke: if a woman has straight hair, she wants them to curl if curly, then by all means straighten.
“A woman always wants something to change. And the Middle ages is no exception. But because the time was not plastic surgeons, women could shave your eyebrows, to make some extraordinary hairstyles that are now perceived quite informal. In any case, they tried to change themselves. But at the time it was maybe interesting, original and even unusual,” said psychologist Sergei lang.
Today, some standards of beauty from the past seem to be just insane.
It is difficult to imagine the suffering of young Chinese women who in childhood have tight bandaged foot.
This was done in order that the feet always remained small.
But such practices have led to a terrible deformation of bones and joints.
In principle, many could no longer walk.
But beauty was important because it determined the future of girls, including and a successful marriage.
“If we’re in a time machine go to Ancient China and say, “Oh, my God, why have you bandage the girls legs? They just become sedentary in life.”
They would say to us: “You insignificant little people who are not surrounded by servants, do not know what prestige. We do our girls goddesses”.
Paphos has much more importance than natural data,” said art historian Maria Santi.
And in Japan at all times aspired to the white color face.
To emphasize its high origin, the girls painted face lead and zinc white.
They gave the skin a satin smoothness.
However, from the effects of toxic substances the person has acquired a grayish-yellow color and wrinkled.
Ceruse ate into the skin, but women have used them again and again to hide the resulting stains.
Despite harm (a white lead could cause infertility and even insanity) it was used until the XIX century.
And in the beginning of the twentieth century fashionista focused on the dimples.
Those who were not, had used a special device which was worn on the person, fixed behind the ears and chin, and very much pressed on his cheeks.
After some time of suffering and appeared desirable dimples.
It seems that no matter how crazy or was the standard of beauty, women in the pursuit of them will never stop.
Even before the surgeon’s knife.
Now, for example, someone wants my buttocks as pop diva beyoncé, and someone high cheekbones like Angelina Jolie.
Women are willing to make any sacrifice, just to meet the ideal of his time.
I am not a close follower of the British royal family.
I glance at online headlines and click on an occasional article, and that’s about the extent of it.
But my attention was caught by a headline a few days ago that read “BBC radio host fired over racist royal baby tweet.” “Why is that even possible?”
I wondered, so I read the article.
It identified the new baby as “biracial.”
I didn’t know that.
So, in my usual curious way, I Googled photos of the royal parents.
Prince Harry definitely looked like a Regular British White Guy.
And sure enough, Meghan is the one identified as “black.”
But when I Googled her photo, all I saw was somebody who might be seen as Latin American, or perhaps Southern Italian.
So I went further, and looked at Meghan’s parents.
Her father seems definitely to be another Regular White Guy, while her mother actually appears to have some African heritage.
But I’m guessing (and all of this was just guessing) that even Meghan’s mother is of mixed race, perhaps half African, perhaps even less.
Why does any of this even matter?
And I why shouldn’t I be slammed as a racist myself for even pursuing such a question?
Well, the second answer is simply that I am a naturally curious person, and I love to find the answers to all sorts of useless questions.
No question is forbidden if the motivation is simply to expand my store of knowledge.
But as to why it matters, here is why: Identifying the baby as “biracial” and his mother as “black” perpetuates the old, and wrong, idea that anybody who isn’t “pure” white is non -white, and if you are not white , then you are black .
Which is pure Jim Crow.
And yet we go along with it.
We call a baby “biracial” when he is, what, maybe 1/8 or less black because the full implications of the label “biracial” (two races in equal proportions) does not quite penetrate our consciousness.
I remember, decades ago, filling out forms that for one reason or another asked my racial background, and one of the choices would of course be “white,” while another choice would be “non-white.”
Even back then I saw that the categories could easily be understood as “pure” and “impure,” just as in the days of the Old South, when an “obviously” white man who was discovered to have even a trace of “slave blood” was considered to be black, and therefore ineligible for the privileges of white society.
And here we are today, in our much more “enlightened” age, still using the very same racial categories.
I don’t know what can be done to change it.
But short of ditching racial classification entirely (the ideal outcome), I would prefer somebody like little Archie to be described, if at all, as somebody who is of (I’m making this part up) English/Welsh/German/Ghanaian/Senegalese heritage.
Actually, I don’t even care for that, but it’s better than just saying “black.”
Or even “biracial.”
And that’s my 2¢ worth.
OPINION: Cast your minds back to 1999.
The internet was in its formative years and we were all surviving on painfully-slow 56k dial-up modems.
And despite this lack of speed, an infamous file-sharing program called Napster exploded on to the scene.
Within its two-year lifespan, it brought a multi-billion dollar music industry to its knees.
Sales of CDs halved within a few years.
And there was nothing anybody could do.
The secret was out.
Anyone with an internet connection, no matter how slow, could download practically any song for free.
Without going to the shops, without even leaving their house.
Why am I telling you this?
Because it demonstrates just how quickly technology can change an industry.
And I think TV will be the next giant to fall.
It's already happening.
Spark, a telecommunications company, changed the status quo by winning the rights in New Zealand to broadcast the Rugby World Cup this year.
Fair enough.
The move away from traditional TV delivery methods is a predictable one.
David Court: "If you ask me, Spark Sport could be in for a bloody nose this Rugby World Cup."
Spark Sport will also charge users $59.99 for the privilege.
Also fair enough.
It's capitalism.
People will pay the price if they're happy with it.
If Spark can make a profit from that, good luck to 'em.
But there's one problem.
Spark Sport only owns the rights to broadcast in New Zealand.
And broadcasters in other countries – England – are also broadcasting the 2019 Rugby World Cup.
For free.
Of course, overseas broadcasts will only be available to internet users in that country.
But there's one small problem with that.
VPNs exist.
And VPNs allow users to spoof their location to practically any country in the world for just a few dollars a week.
This isn't a brand-new thing.
Nor is it on a small scale.
In 2015, the BBC reported that more than 60 million people from outside the United Kingdom were using VPNs to watch BBC iPlayer for free.
If you ask me, Spark Sport could be in for a bloody nose this Rugby World Cup.
What are VPNs?
A VPN (virtual private network) is essentially the combination of military-grade encryption software and a global network of servers.
This simple combination lets VPN users spoof their internet connection to anywhere in the world where their provider has a server.
And most VPNs own tens of thousands of servers in more than 100 countries.
Initially, VPNs were used by people who wanted an added level of privacy when browsing the web.
They were also a virtual lifeline to citizens in certain countries, like North Korea, China and Saudi Arabia, where the internet is heavily censored.
But more recently, casual internet users have also discovered that the combination of encryption and a global network of servers has other benefits, such as accessing another country's free-to-air television channels.
Understandably, the popularity of VPNs is rapidly growing.
How are broadcasters fighting back?
Bear with me here.
Since 2016, broadcasters announced that they would start blocking VPNs from streaming their content.
Netflix and BBC iPlayer have been leading the way here as they're two of the most popular destinations for VPN users, but their success has been limited.
And that's putting it nicely.
Military-grade encryption is, as you'd expect, really good.
And that's significant here as it prevents a broadcaster from tracing the true location of their users.
Streaming services, therefore, have to block IP addresses (internet connections) they suspect belong to VPNs.
They do this first by using GeoIP databases to check who owns the IP.
Broadcasters also know that VPNs share their network servers (IP addresses) with large volumes of people.
This sometimes creates an abnormal number of simultaneous connections to the same site, from the same IP address.
If/when this happens, the offending address is blacklisted, thus blocking the VPN.
However, the effectiveness of this is limited as VPN companies simply create new servers.
In April 2018, the National Trust introduced new regulations on hunting.
The charity said these would make hunts “more accountable” while on its land.
So, The Canary caught up with National Dis-Trust (NDT), which holds the National Trust to account on hunting, to get its view on the new system.
In October 2017, at the charity’s annual AGM, the National Trust faced a motion to ban all hunting from its land.
The motion lost by just 300 votes.
But this narrow margin only spurred anti-hunting campaigners on even more.
The charity eventually agreed to review its hunt licensing system during the summer of 2018 and told The Canary in May 2018 that monitoring would be “stepped up” during the following season.
The 2018/19 hunting season ran roughly from September 2018 to April 2019.
And it was the first season to implement the National Trust’s revised monitoring system.
New measures included a “tightening up” of information available on the website as well as a new on-the-ground hunt monitoring team led by Nick Droy.
The National Trust said these measures would make hunts “more accountable and less likely to disturb wildlife on our land”.
Now the first season has ended, The Canary asked NDT its thoughts on how the new system has played out.
And the group was blunt in its opinion.
The National Trust cancelled a number of hunting licences during the 2018/19 season.
One of the most high-profile hunts dropped was the Portman Hunt, which had two dates cancelled in March at the Kingston Lacy estate, Dorset.
The BBC reported that the National Trust would not comment on specific allegations against hunts.
But the League Against Cruel Sports said it came after a “string of incidents” by the Portman Hunt, including allegedly killing a fox on 2 January.
Other hunting dates dropped by the charity include the South Shropshire Hunt at Long Mynd and the Trinity Foot and South Herts Beagles at Ashridge Estate.
The Canary asked NDT how it felt about this.
It said the cancellations were “definitely a step forward overall”, but that they were “in some ways frustrating as well”.
The National Trust appears to treat each hunt as an individual case.
Yet a consistent pattern across time and location emerges out of the charity’s own banning choices.
This led NDT to ask: We’ve seen multiple hunts lose their licences this season, some for blatantly hunting foxes on National Trust land as was the case on Long Mynd in Shropshire – but how many licences does the Trust have to cancel before conceding, after spending far too long refusing to change, that we are right in what we’re saying?
The National Trust says it permits trail hunting on its land.
In this legal activity, hunts should follow an artificially laid scent and avoid chasing wildlife.
But anti-hunting activists have consistently claimed that trail hunting is a scam intended to hide ongoing illegal chasing and killing of wildlife.
On the other hand, activists and members of the public have caught hunts using National Trust land without a licence.
On Facebook, NDT listed 24 instances of hunts trespassing on the charity’s land during the 2018/19 season.
Many of these included video or photographic evidence.
The National Trust says that it takes this issue “very seriously”.
But NDT told The Canary that: due to the attitude of the Trust, even when we report trespass, they refuse to update us about what they’re actually doing about it.
In one case, staff were in such a hurry to provide a copy & paste response describing how seriously they take licence breaches that they overlooked the fact that the hunt in question (the Cheshire Hounds) wasn’t even licensed – but they didn’t respond when this was pointed out.
And it said that fell packs have been particularly egregious in their actions.
Fell packs are foot-based fox hunts located throughout the Lake District and include the Coniston Foxhounds, Blencathra Foxhounds and Melbreak Foxhounds.
In November 2018, the Times claimed these hunts would be absent from National Trust land due to the “risk of attack by animal rights activists”.
But NDT said that: The key area, Cumbria (where National Dis-Trust began its campaign), has seen very frequent trespass from the criminal fell packs, none of which were licensed at all for the 2018/19 season For example, Cumbria Huntwatch claimed to have seen the Melbreak Foxhounds trespassing onto National Trust land near Lorton on 26 November 2018.
And Lancashire Hunt Sabs said it saw the Blencathra Foxhounds on the charity’s land on 29 December 2018.
NDT told The Canary there’s also been instances where hunts have exploited a loophole in the National Trust’s system: Even after licences [were] cancelled, at least one hunt still appeared on Trust land with their permission.
This was the Surrey Union Hunt, who killed a fox on 1st December 2018 and soon after withdrew their own Trust licence.
They later met at Netley House in February 2019 without a licence; the Trust responded by saying they didn’t need one as they ‘weren’t hunting’ and all concerns were met with arrogant dismissal.
In other words, the Surrey Union Hunt started and ended its day at Netley House on National Trust land.
But it technically hunted on land outside of the charity’s remit.
NDT said this loophole “isn’t acceptable” and that it: isn’t even in keeping with what the National Trust claim they want to do i.e. to be transparent on the issue.
We’ve referred to the Surrey Union Hunt, but actually there are a number of hunts that meet on Trust land for Boxing Day and these meets are nowhere to be found on the list of licensed ‘trail hunts’.
For example, the Avon Vale Hunt at Lacock and the Warwickshire Hunt at Upton House.
The group said it is “working” on getting this issue resolves with the National Trust.
They say something like 90 percent of the things we worry about never happen.
The point, therefore, is to not waste time or energy, and stop worrying.
It’s nearly impossible for some of us.
We are a not-brave but weary few: the champion warriors, those of us perpetuating the burgeoning cause of angst like a ribbon-worthy foundation.
We proud, pointless, exhausted few… I saw a Stevie Nicks quote the other day that totally spoke to me.
She said, “I’ve learned as time passes, all the things you’re afraid of will come, and they will go, and you’ll be all right.”
And I thought, yes.
This.
Some folks either don’t worry or don’t mind worrying.
My brother Hash seems to enjoy telling me how bad things are going to get.
He follows markets and futures and loves to make sure I know just how imminent the doom really is; whether it is economic collapse or global famine or biological warfare, it’s coming and there’s nothing we can do about it, so…why do I want to know?
We all have ups and downs in life.
But, like Stevie Nicks, the thing I have observed is that, somehow when the worst finally happens, it does often bring with it a kind of macabre peace.
It was in the back of my mind my whole life, worrying we would lose the farm.
Daddy complained and shared at every turn, how bleak the market always was, and how times were getting harder.
And then finally they got hard enough and the camel’s back finally gave.
For years, the worry was there, though pushed to the back for most of the time.
After all, as we tell ourselves sometimes, it’s always been OK, so it will always be.
Until the day when it isn’t… When something you have long feared finally comes to fruition, when the demon from the back of your mind finally jumps in front of your eyes, it can be overwhelming.
And yet, the sun keeps rising, doesn’t it?
And even though some things we go through emotionally are almost too hard to bear… we do.
We keep going on.
What recourse have we?
And I found myself, when the dust had settled, looking around and thinking that is one less thing I have to worry about.
What a strange, dreary blessing.
I no longer have to worry about losing the farm, because it happened.
We lost it.
It’s gone.
But we’re still standing.
We are still alive.
When I was a small child, the worst thing I could imagine was losing my Mommy.
She stayed at home and worked on the farm and so was always there.
The rare times she would leave us, I was devastated.
I would miss and pine for her until she got back home.
Nothing seemed right until she was on the place again.
I recall being old enough that I didn’t cry, but I still was not happy or at ease until she returned.
She was my safe place and my closest love.
And then one day, the worst happened.
I was grown when my Mom passed away, but still was quite young.
Again, devastated doesn’t touch it.
And yet…when this worst thing happens, and the sun still comes up…I don’t know about you, but don’t you get to the point where you look around and think, “Yeah…that was truly awful. But I’m still here.”
What’s my point?
This is America, and I don’t have to have one.
But if I did, I reckon my point is just that there have been other times in life when something I worried about sure enough did happen.
I, like all of you, have wept and moaned and regretted and worn my falling countenance as if it might trip me into oblivion, and I wouldn’t care when it did.
There are still things not yet happened that I worry about and dread or pray never come to pass.
But in the meantime, I have the heartbreak under my belt to fall back on and know: That didn’t kill me. I thought at the time it might, but it didn’t.
Maybe this next thing won’t either.
I reckon then the best thing about the worst is that: You live through it.
You get it over with.
And sometimes if you’re really lucky, things get better again.
That’s the best thing about the worst.
It does end.
You might carry the grief, but you can let go of the fear.
Whatever you think, you need an editor.
There comes a time in every writer’s life when the plot is adequately twisted, the characters are adequately developed, and all the typos have been eliminated with a laser gun.
You think.
Actually, you’re not sure if any of that is true because you’ve been staring at the same document on your computer for so long you’re kind of wondering if maybe you didn’t go blind last week.
You think you’re reading words.
You think those words are good.
The dreams about your story have stopped and now all you dream about is book parties and signings and big wigs and wine.
You think you’re ready to submit.
To publish.
To throw caution to the wind and send that manuscript off for some close reading.
Except you haven’t been able to read your own manuscript closely for months now and you’re honestly not sure what it says anymore.
Your characters could be marrying dogs or lost somewhere else in the muddle, you have no idea.
That’s why you need an editor.
Someone who doesn’t know you or love you but knows writing and loves reading freshly pressed work.
Someone who will look at your characters and say, “Hey, cool story, but did you notice Sally marries a dog on page 23?”
When I receive a manuscript to read, I welcome it with open arms.
And the brave writers who have sent their words to me wait patiently in the background brimming with nervous energy.
It’s a great relationship.
We email back and forth about little things.
We laugh.
I read and make notes.
And then I send the editorial letter.
And that’s when the fun stops.
Right there, in one convenient document, is an overview of all the concerns I have regarding their manuscript.
Plot holes, flat characters, lagging prose, over-telling, over-explaining, back story — all of it.
Their manuscript is suddenly less pristine and more of a mess and I know I’m not gonna be the one to clean it up.
Receiving an editorial letter after you’ve paid to have your novel edited sucks.
It just — sucks.
That’s pretty much the only thing I can say.
But!
That same editorial letter that sucks so much to read is also the heart and soul of what you paid for.
You asked someone professional with an objective eye to read your manuscript and deconstruct it — and that’s exactly what they did.
And they even went one step further and gave you suggestions on how to clean up your mess.
Still, I can hear it through the email; the writer’s happiness just deflates.
I receive an answer just dripping with defeat.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.
Steel your skin and prepare your mind before you open that letter.
And remember these things:
1. What is a Finished Piece to You is a Rough Draft to Me You may believe your manuscript to be finished and polished — but if you’re sending it to an editor, it’s not.
Why else would it end up on an editor’s desk?
There are things going on in your manuscript that you are simply blind to because you no longer have the distance and objectivity to see it.
Why would you?
You’ve spent months with your nose to the screen trying to figure out how to finish this thing.
2. Just Because You Receive In-Depth Edits Doesn’t Mean You Suck Everyone receives in-depth edits.
Everyone receives suggestions for change.
Everyone has to get edited.
I, too, am a writer.
And my critique group always makes suggestions for changes.
They even tell me ::gasp:: that something is not working .
And I get sad.
I go home.
I take a nap.
And then I rewrite.
3. By All Means, Get Angry — Just Don’t Call Me When you receive edits and they seem overwhelming, you’re going to get angry.
And you’re probably going to be angry at me.
That’s the nature of the beast.
So get angry.
But remember that it’s not me you’re angry with.
Frankly, you’re upset with yourself because you sent something that you thought was ready to go and it turned out to not be so ready after all.
And that’s okay, really.
It’s human nature to get upset when things are hard and writing is just that.
So read your letter, take a few deep breaths, hit a punching bag, and take a nap.
Seriously.
Naps fix everything.
When your emotions are defused and you’re ready to get back to work, then you can email me.
4. I’m Not Here to Make You Feel Bad My job is to make your writing better, and by default, make you a stronger person.
My job is not to take your money and rip your work to shreds.
It is not in my interest to be snarky and make you feel like shit.
I don’t want to make you give up.
I want to make your writing better.
I want to make your writing better.
I want to make your writing better.
That’s the first and last concern on any editor’s mind when we read your work.
Apple Computer was an innovative and nimble company in 1987, so it makes sense that people at the tech giant would imagine a world dominated by Apple ten years into the future.
And that’s precisely what it did when it released this goofy video from the perspective of the year 1997.
The 1987 video, which can be viewed on YouTube, is clearly meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but it shows viewers an amazing world of technological innovation with a handful of things that we actually got.
The video shows Apple payphone stations that communicate with satellites in space (at least they got the satellite part right), and something called the Vista Mac II, eyewear that doubles as a computer (something that we’re still waiting on, sadly).
And there’s so much more.
“There’s no question about it. The 1990s have really been the Apple decade,” former Apple CEO John Sculley says in the video from the imagined perspective of 1997.
It’s easy for those of us in 2019 to forget that there was a time when Apple was struggling.
And oddly enough, it struggled the most in the mid-1990s, precisely when this video was supposed to take place.
Apple reported its worst quarter ever in March 1996 and there was a very real chance that it wouldn’t survive.
Knowing that fact makes this video all the funnier.
CEO Sculley, it should be noted, was forced out in 1993.
Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak pops up a few times in the video to set up jokes about the size of computers ten years hence and even the future of automated mental health.
“A computer that talks is no big deal. A computer that really listens, that’s a breakthrough,” Woz says before the video cuts to a woman on a therapist’s couch.
The therapist, as it turns out, is an Apple computer.
The video has everything from holograms to networking—something that was still in its infancy in the days before the invention of the World Wide Web.
And we see an Apple computer in a kitchen right next to the coffee maker.
“Good morning, this is October 5, 1997,” the computer says.
“I have checked four wire services, scanned eight magazines and eighteen newspapers, and accessed the New York, Paris, and Tokyo databases. Here are three items you may be interested in.”
The 1987 video even has a fake news anchor proclaiming that Apple broke the $20 billion mark in revenue during 1997.
In reality, Apple’s revenue was just $1.6 billion in 1997, though the tech giant has certainly made up for it since then.
Apple reported $265.6 billion in revenue last year.
The video is full of jokes, but it’s easy to forget that some of the best futurism of the 20th century was jokes.
Even the original 1962 version of “The Jetsons” animated show was actually a parody of 1950s futurism.
And yet “The Jetsons” endures today as an important cultural touchstone for sincerely talking about the future.
And this video survives in much the same way.
Yes, it’s silly.
But it got to the heart of quite a few things we actually wanted—many 0f which we’re still waiting on today.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK.
It accounts for 15% of all new cases in the country, and about one in eight women will be diagnosed with it during their lifetime.
In the NHS, breast cancer screening routinely includes a mammogram, which is essentially an X-ray of the breast.
But the future of this early test is at risk as the number of specialists able to read them declines.
While this skills shortfall can’t be made up immediately, promising advances in artificial intelligence may be able to help.
Interpreting a mammogram is a complex process normally performed by specially trained radiologists and radiographers.
Their skills are vital to the early detection and diagnosis of this cancer.
They visually scrutinise batches of mammograms in a session for signs of breast cancer.
But these signs are often ambiguous or hard to see.
False negative rates – where cancers are incorrectly diagnosed or missed – are between 20 and 30% for mammography.
These are either errors in perception or errors in interpretation, and can be attributed to the sensitivity or specificity of the reader.
It is widely believed that the key to developing the expertise needed to interpret mammograms is rigorous training, extensive practice and experience.
And while researchers like myself are looking into training strategies and perceptual learning modules which can expedite the transition from novice reader to expert, others have been investigating how AI could be used to speed up diagnosis and improve its accuracy.
Machine diagnosis As in countless other fields, the potential for AI algorithms to help with cancer diagnosis has not gone unrecognised.
Along with breast cancer, researchers have been looking at how AI can improve the efficacy and efficiency of care for lung, brain and prostate cancer, in order to meet ever increasing diagnosis demands.
Even Google is looking at how AI can be used to diagnose cancer.
The search giant has trained an algorithm to detect tumours which have metastasised, with a 99% success rate.
For breast cancer, the focus so far has been on how AI can help diagnose the disease from mammograms.
Every mammogram is read by two specialists, which can lead to potential delays in diagnosis if there is a shortfall in expertise.
But researchers have been looking at introducing AI systems at the time of the screening.
The idea is that it would support a specialist’s findings without waiting for the second opinion of another professional.
This would reduce the waiting time and associated anxiety for the women who have been tested.
AI has already made substantial strides in cancer image recognition.
In late 2018, researchers reported that one commercial system matched the accuracy of over 28,000 interpretations of screening mammograms by 101 radiologists.
This means it achieved a cancer detection accuracy comparable to an expert radiologist.
In another study led by the same researcher, radiologists using an AI system for support showed an improved rate of improved breast cancer detection – rising from 83% to 86%.
This research also found that using an AI system reduced the amount of time radiologists spent analysing the images on screen.
Fine tuning But while the potential of AI has been welcomed by some radiologists, it has brought suspicion from others.
And though other researchers have also found that AI is just as good at detecting breast cancers from mammograms as its human counterparts, this comes with the caveat that more fine tuning and software improvement is needed before it can be safely introduced into breast screening programmes.
Exciting as it may be to think that AI could be used to help detect such a prevalent cancer, specialist and public confidence needs to be taken into consideration before it can be introduced.
Acceptance of the technology is vital so that patients and medical professionals know they are receiving the correct results.
As yet, there has been little research into the public perception of AI in breast cancer screening, but more general studies into AI and healthcare have found that 39% of people are willing to engage with artificial intelligence/robotics for healthcare.
This rises to 55% for the 18- to 24-year-old demographic.
The AI systems are still in the research phase, with no firm plans to use it to diagnose patients in the UK yet.
But these promising results show there is a tremendous opportunity for the delivery of radiology healthcare services, and ultimately the potential to detect more patients with breast and other cancers.
Hillary Clinton gave a lengthy interview to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Wednesday night, but she wasn't asked a single question about her own campaign's efforts to dig up dirt on Donald Trump, by way of foreign agents hired by Fusion GPS, paid for by the Clinton campaign and the Democrat Party.
The Maddow platform gave Clinton an opportunity to suggest once again that the Russians stole the election for Trump and that's why she lost.
And she said she's warning the current crop of Democrat presidential hopefuls that the same thing could happen to them.
Maddow asked Clinton: "I wondered, as you read the Mueller report, at least the parts of it that we can read, did you learn new things about what happened to you and your campaign in 2016 that you didn't know before reading it?" "I learned more, and I learned more detail," Clinton said.
But here's the important thing to me.
What I learned is that the Russians were successful.
I don't think there's any way to read that report and not conclude they accomplished what they set out to do.
They had an objective to sow discord and divisiveness within our society at large, and to help Donald Trump.
And they succeeded.
So let's move our vision forward and say to yourself, if you're in the Kremlin, you're Vladimir Putin who I've sat across (from) -- I understand his goal is to weaken America. I know that. He doesn't like me because I stood up for America. I get it. So if you're sitting there and you're saying this worked really well -- Trump just foments divisiveness in America.
He is helping to tear the country apart.
People are so upset.
What are we going to do to help him this time?
How do we best accomplish that?
And because we (the U.S.) have no real follow-up, and one of the things that concerned me in the Mueller report is when it's written that they didn't investigate whether or not the Russian active measures actually changed votes or affected the outcome because they assumed someone else was doing that.
They assumed the FBI was doing that.
And then we learned that the former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is ordered not to talk about election interference in front of Trump.
And then we learn that there is no concerted effort going on anywhere in our government to try to understand what it means that, for example, at least one county in Florida was breached, but not only that, the network of election machinery in one area.
What does all that mean?
If you're sitting in a secretary of state's office in some state or in a county election commission, what are you supposed to do?
And I'll tell you, Rachel, I met with most of the candidates who are running this time and answered their questions.
I always tell them, you know, you can run the best campaign.
You can be the person who gets the nomination, but unless we know how to protect our election from what happened before and what could happen again, because there is greater sophistication about it, you could lose.
And I don't mean it to scare anybody, but I do want every candidate to understand that this remains a threat...It wasn't on the level in 2016.
It could be once again not on the level, because we have never really understood as much as we need to.
And I think the Mueller report didn't go there.
That wasn't what they thought their charge was.
And since there is no, you know, like 9/11 commission to figure out what it is that happened.
So how we prevent it should be the priority of everyone.
I worry a lot that there's a greater sophistication.
They've learned some things that they now are going to deploy against us.
And us means the country, not just Democrats.
WALTER SMITH once transfer-listed Andy Goram because he was so exasperated with his behaviour.
But I don’t think for a minute Steven Gerrard has considered doing something similar with Allan McGregor.
Rangers keeper Allan McGregor was sent off by Bobby Madden against Hibs Having said that, there’s no doubt the Rangers manager must be pulling his hair out about what to do with his veteran keeper.
McGregor is one of those guys who is supposed to be setting the example as his side try to close the gap on Celtic.
But he’ll be sitting in the stand when Neil Lennon’s Hoops visit Ibrox for the final time this season.
That’s no good to Gerrard — or his team-mates — as they look to put down a marker for next time around.
And the thing he’ll be concerned with most is that it’s his BEST players who continue to step out of line.
Rangers look to McGregor and Alfredo Morelos to produce almost every time they step across that white line.
And they have — but the problem is they’ve been banned more times this season than anyone else at Ibrox.
In McGregor’s case, what must gall Gerrard even more is he keeps getting involved in nothing incidents.
You’d think at this stage of his career he would be calming down.
Instead he seems to be getting ANGRIER .
Keepers tend to be overprotected these days, but McGregor has taken it to another level this season.
The Gers No1 has always had a fiery side to his character, but now he seems to be in a permanently bad mood.
And at times it seems when anyone gets within a yard of him, he feels the urge to lash out.
It happened with Kristoffer Ajer in the first Old Firm game, it happened with Lewis Ferguson at Pittodrie.
He clashed with Motherwell’s Peter Hartley at Fir Park and then there was last week’s kick at Marc McNulty.
It’s not as if any of those players touched McGregor — he has been the aggressor each time.
And if you keep playing with fire then you’ll eventually get burned, as last week showed.
Gerrard has to hope that, by having to watch this game from the stand, the penny might finally drop.
This is certainly not an issue that he and Rangers can afford to let drag on to next season.
If they are going to end Celtic’s bid to win nine in a row they’re going to need everyone pulling the same way.
And there’s no question McGregor, at his best, is still a fantastic asset.
In the meantime, Wes Foderingham will don the gloves when his side face the Hoops.
And what an opportunity this is for him to sign off at the Ibrox club in the best possible way.
I thought Foderingham did well last year, but when Gerrard got the chance to upgrade the position by bringing in McGregor it was a no-brainer.
Up until last Sunday the Englishman would have thought he’d played his last game for Gers.
But now?
Foderingham has one last chance to show what he can do in a massive Old Firm clash.
And that could be the difference in what kind of move he can get himself this summer.
I expect him to be as fired up as anyone in a Rangers side desperate to prove a point.
On the face of it, both sides don’t have too much to play for given their respective positions.
But there’s NEVER been a dead rubber Old Firm game in the past and that’s not going to change now.
That win, which put the Ibrox side level with the Hoops, had them believing they could win the league.
But over the second half of the season the Parkhead side have proved to be far superior in every department.
And that’s why they head back to Govan this time around with the title well and truly in the bag.
Rangers, though, will want to show they are still a match for their rivals in a one-off game.
And a win would be the perfect way to say, ‘We’re still here — and we’ll see you next season’.
But Celtic will be just as keen to prove a point after failing to turn up that day in December.
Lenny’s side will want to show why they are champions and right the wrongs of that afternoon.
And a convincing win at the home of their oldest foes would be the perfect way to do it.
Pochettino ready to shock Tottenham and QUIT in summer unless he gets assurances by Daniel Levy despite Champions League heroics
Shawn Mendes is one of the biggest names in music, and he’s got the fanbase to prove it.
The 20-year-old released his first single, “Life of the Party” in 2014, which made him the youngest artist to debut in the top 25 of the Hot 100 with their first song.
Now, he’s headed to the SNL stage where he’s the musical guest, with Adam Sandler hosting for the first time in 24 years.
And as he takes to the stage, fans will undoubtedly grow curious about Mendes’ relationship status.
Is the heartthrob single?
In a relationship?
What do we know?
These days, Mendes appears to be single.
In a recent interview with Variety, the singer shared, “I’m not currently dating anyone, but it’s not because I don’t have time — I don’t know if I’d be dating anyone if I was home in Pickering, either,” he says.
“It hasn’t stumbled across me, and I’m not chasing it. Of course, seeing all those other artists and people in relationships, you think, ‘Maybe it would be nice; who would be great for me?’ And that’s when you realize: ‘This is wrong. Let it be. I’m not supposed to be with anyone right now.’”
In a separate February interview with Extra, Mendes admitted that he didn’t have a Valentine.
He said, “If I had a girlfriend, I think I definitely would celebrate… I never have gone and done something big for Valentine’s Day.”
He added, similarly to his interview with Variety, that he’s simply not looking for anything now.
But what about the past?
Who has Shawn dated up to this point?
For months, the singer was rumored to be dating Hailey Baldwin.
In 2013, Hailey even tweeted that she wanted to date Mendes when he was still a star on vine.
In 2018, the two walked together on the Met Gala red carpet.
They said it was “just as friends”, and they may have been telling the truth, because now, Hailey is married to Justin Bieber.
Her Instagram even boasts her new name.
And then there’s the whole Camila Cabello thing.
For years, fans speculated that Cabello and Mendes were seeing one another, but they, too, said it was totally platonic.
In February, rumors surfaced once again that the two were an item, after Cabello posted the following tweet: The latter part of the message, “I love you forever” is what really got fans thinking they may be an item, but if they are dating, it seems they’re keen on keeping the relationship under wraps for now.
Be sure to watch Mendes take to the stage to perform on SNL tonight at 11:30pm ET/PT.
Video New details are emerging from the deadly shooting in Southern California.
The deadly April 27 attack on the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California was particularly jarring for our Shadow Mountain Church Community.
Our congregation is a half hour from the synagogue, and our proudly Zionist church cherishes the Jews in our community, in Israel and around the world.
This has generally been our history in the United States since the first 23 Jewish immigrants landed in New Amsterdam (now New York City) in 1654.
Space prevents me from retelling the entire story of the mutual affection expressed between a Jewish congregation in Newport, Rhode Island, and the newly elected President George Washington.
But after a visit to Newport, President Washington wrote to the congregation: “May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while everyone shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.”
What I’m about to say is a dramatic statement, but not an overstatement.
I believe America’s future, and any nation’s future, depends in large part on one simple factor: our relationship to the tiny nation of Israel.
You may be wondering whether my thinking is upside down.
America is the world’s greatest superpower with a population of nearly 329 million; Israel is a tiny sliver of land accommodating only about 9 million people.
One would think that America is the key to Israel’s survival, not the other way around.
But I’m an unapologetic believer in the promises God has laid out in Scripture.
He tells us in Genesis 12:3, speaking to Abraham, “I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you.”
And God has a perfect track record for keeping His promises.
In some parts of Israel, herding one’s family to a bomb shelter is an almost routine experience.
But when Israelis take the tough but necessary measures to defend themselves, they are slammed by world censure by the likes of the United Nations.
Meanwhile, today a number of elected U.S. politicians openly voice their opposition to the “Children of the Stock of Abraham.”
The Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign has also gained a disturbing level of popularity in America, from college campuses to Capitol Hill.
Proponents claim to be holding Israel accountable for alleged human rights violations.
Yet in reality, we know the BDS movement is merely a cover for a deep-seated, centuries-long hatred of Israel and the Jewish people.
Many U.S. politicians have publicly supported the BDS movement, or at least are too scared to criticize it.
Fortunately some – including House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
, – have been courageous enough to confront members of their own party on this dangerous movement.
America is not the only nation in Western civilization to have politicians making poor choices regarding Israel and her descendants.
In Great Britain, there’s been a dramatic rise in anti-Semitic rhetoric, especially within Britain’s Labour Party, which has been the traditional home for most Jewish voters.
And all of this is taking place on a continent that should mind some extra caution, given its history with anti-Semitism.
We all know where intolerance can lead if left unchecked, and that oppression and opposition to Jews is nothing new.
That being said, whether or not our politicians, professors and pundits leave Israel alone, I’ve got a feeling that Israel is going to be just fine.
After originally reaching their promised homeland, the people of the young nation were continually attacked by hostile tribes and other nations.
In 722 B.C. the Assyrians conquered northern Israel and deported its people.
In 586 B.C. Babylon conquered southern Israel and exiled its citizens.
The Jews returned to their homeland 70 years later, but the Romans finally crushed them in A.D. 70, leaving them without a country for 1,878 years.
In the countries of their exile, the Jews were oppressed, denied rights, isolated in ghettos and persecuted.
In 1933, there were 9 million Jews living throughout Europe, but by 1945 two out of three European Jews had been gassed, beaten, starved to death or died of disease in Nazi concentration camps.
The Holocaust led to the elimination of one-third of the world’s Jewish population.
Since 1948 and the establishment of the modern state of Israel – despite being hemmed in on all sides by hostile nations and against all odds or human logic – Israel has survived all-out war and constant threats of terrorism.
Israel has been forced to maintain a continual state of warfare throughout its 71 years of existence.
Yet increasingly, the international media portray Israel as an aggressor nation, an occupying force, a brutal regime afflicting poor and disenfranchised Palestinians who have had their land stolen out from under them.
Indeed, many among the Palestinians genuinely want a peaceful resolution to the current conflict.
But a Palestinian nationalism continues to thrive with its singular fixation: the death of Israel.
The Palestinian leaders pay stipends to terrorists and their families who kill Israelis, financed in part by the Israel-hating and America-hating regime of Iran.
Modern Israel has mainly been surrounded by enemies who do not recognize its right to exist and openly vow to annihilate it.
These nations occupy a land mass of more than 5 million square miles.
Tiny Israel occupies a land mass of almost 9,000 square miles.
In some parts of Israel, herding one’s family to a bomb shelter is an almost routine experience.
But when Israelis take the tough but necessary measures to defend themselves, they are slammed by world censure by the likes of the United Nations.
The problem seems to be that many in the West won’t admit that Israel is in a fight for its very survival.
Yet the story of the Jews is not over yet.
In spite of overwhelming odds and seemingly insurmountable challenges, the Jewish people have maintained Israel’s position as the only true democracy in the Middle East and the epicenter of progress in their region of the world.
CAMDEN, N.J. — Having won the home-court edge in the second round of the NBA playoffs, with all their players relatively healthy and behind the momentum of a telling victory in Toronto, the 76ers will return to the Wells Fargo Center Thursday low on concerns.
So, there is this: In Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Raptors, Joel Embiid took five shots and scored 16 points.
In Game 2, Embiid took two shots and provided 12 points.
Even with the reality that Embiid had been battling a sore knee and, for Game 2, was so stricken by gastroenteritis that he reportedly required pregame treatments, that is a potential crisis.
Long term, and their postseason requirements aren't even close to half over, the 76ers need Embiid to score.
They need him to score big.
They need him to score from in tight and behind the arc.
They need him to make free throws.
Then they need him to score some more.
So it was after practice Wednesday that Embiid, who regularly announces that he is basketball's most unstoppable force, was confronted with those two pedestrian box score lines.
His basic response: Eh.
“I've watched a lot of film,” Embiid said.
“I've always figured things out somehow. I have been stopped in situations before. So I'm going to figure it out. But at the end of the day, I'll do whatever I am asked to do.”
After he was neutralized by Marc Gasol in Game 1, Embiid was widely expected to be asked to provide more down-low force in Game 2.
At times, that looked to be the Sixers' plan.
Yet in 32:05 on court, Embiid looked slow, if not sluggish.
The stomach issues were real.
So there was that.
But as he saw it, he took what the game provided, supplied what the game required, and was happy with a critical 94-89 victory that helped the Sixers avoid series catastrophe.
“If I have to set screens, roll to the basket and find other guys when I am doubled, that's what I'll do,” he said.
“ And I am going to keep on doing that. I am not going to force the issue because I am not averaging the same amount of points or I am not scoring as much.”
Embiid averaged 27.5 points in the regular season and had 31 in a first-round game against the Nets.
He did not score fewer than 22 points in the Brooklyn series.
The Raptors, who knew the deal, acquired Gasol at the trade deadline strictly to match up against Embiid, or at least it was so whispered.
At 7-1, 255 pounds, with the ability to stray from the paint and add to the passing game, Gasol is a virtual professional copy of Embiid.
“He's a great defender,” Embiid said.
“He's big. He's also pretty smart. And their whole defensive scheme is good. They shift a lot. And most of the time, we are seeing double and triple teams. So it is hard to find myself in a one-on-one situation. He's a great defender. But if they are going to keep throwing up those double and triple teams, then I've got to pass the ball. That's all I can do, either make a quick move or pass the ball. “They are such a heavy shift team, it's kind of hard to go quick, because they are coming. So I just have to be patient and make the right decisions.”
Not only have the Raptors confronted Embiid with Gasol, but they have aggressively helped against the Sixers' center.
Though it didn't help Toronto preserve its home-court advantage, it did help limit the Sixers to 95 points in Game 1 and 94 in Game 2, that after they'd almost scored at will vs. Brooklyn.
It is a plan Toronto could continue to use, and one that, eventually, could drag the ever confident and proud Embiid into frustration during a potentially lengthy series.
Game 3 will start at 8 Thursday.
“We've got great shooters,” Embiid said.
“We've got guys who can make plays. It's definitely easier to trust your teammates, knowing that they have a good shot at scoring the ball. We have to make sure we make the right pass or the right decision. That goes a long way. And I am extremely comfortable with that.”
That comfort helped the Sixers win a game in Toronto, though it was not really sealed until Embiid forced his way to the hoop for a critical bucket against Gasol and two helping Raptors with 24.3 seconds left.
“If I only have to take five shots, but I make the right decisions to win the game,” Embiid said, “that's what I am going to do.”
Q:I've Been Working on the Railroad. My husband and I live in Utah.
We went to file for our Social Security benefits last week.
And we were shocked to learn that his claim must be processed by some railroad board.
Why?
The work he did for the railroad was more than 30 years ago!
A: I can explain.
But frankly, I can't quite understand it.
Recently, I wrote a column in which I bragged about the fact that I can give the rationale behind almost all Social Security rules and regulations.
But I admitted there were several rules that I couldn't explain.
I forgot to add this one.
It involves the jurisdiction of Social Security claims involving people who also worked for a railroad.
Many of my readers may not be aware of this, but people who work for a railroad don't pay into Social Security.
Instead, they are covered by the Railroad Retirement System.
Why that is dates back to the 1930s.
Congress started working on setting up a pension system for railroaders before they got going on Social Security legislation.
Once they got the ball rolling on Social Security, I guess Congress figured that people who worked for a railroad didn't need to be covered under the new Social Security law since they already had their own pension system.
But almost all railroad employees have worked at other jobs where they have paid into Social Security.
And here's the rub.
The rules say that if you have just 10 or more years of railroad work, the Railroad Retirement Board has jurisdiction of not only the payment of railroad benefits, but also of any claims for Social Security benefits that you or your dependents or survivors might file.
You didn't tell me how long your husband worked for the railroad.
But here is a typical example.
Hal worked for a railroad for just over 12 years early in his life.
However, he spent the rest of his career, about 40 years, working at jobs where he paid into Social Security.
So when he files for Social Security retirement benefits, Hal is surprised, and probably a little upset, to learn that his Social Security claim must be sent to the Railroad Retirement Board for processing.
And if his wife files for spousal benefits on Hal's record, her claim is shipped to RRB for processing, too.
They will end up getting whatever Social Security benefits they are due, with some augmented RRB benefits.
But again, the rules say the RRB takes charge of both Social Security and railroad claims.
I understand they have to set up the payment of whatever extra railroad benefits might be due.
But why they have to take control of the Social Security claim is a bit of a mystery.
Anyway, that's why your husband's claim was shipped to the RRB for processing.
And one possible downside to that development is the service you can expect.
Unlike the Social Security Administration, which has something like 1,300 field offices around the country, the RRB has only 30 or so, and most of them are clustered east of the Mississippi.
The good news is that they appear to have a really good website: www.rrb.gov.
Q: I worked for a railroad for eight years back when I was in my early 20s.
Someone told me that I must file for my Social Security benefits with the Railroad Retirement Board.
This doesn't make sense.
A: You're right.
It doesn't make sense.
And that's because it's not true.
Your railroad work didn't meet that 10-year threshold mark that requires RRB jurisdiction.
Guy Verhofstadt has been receiving a lot of attention today for his brutal remarks in a BBC Brexit documentary. The European parliament’s representative on Brexit has angered Leavers after he was filmed laughing at the UK’s dire attempts to get out of the EU and appearing to mock Theresa May.
But this isn’t the first time Verhofstadt has hit back at Brexiteers - the EU politician has been a frequent critic on social media for months.
Here are some of his most ruthless comments.
First up...
Nigel Farage The Brexit Party leader is one of Verhofstadt’s favourite targets and the two have clashed for years in the European parliament.
He called out Farage in 2012 for not attending meetings in the parliament, calling his salary “the biggest waste of EU resources”.
He also mocked Farage over the poorly-attended March to Leave protest earlier this year.
And took a swipe at him during the 2018 World Cup, when Farage tried to belittle Belgium (Verhofstadt’s home country).
But Verhofstadt has also shown his dislike of other Brexiteers.
In February, he doubled-down on Donald Tusk’s “special place in hell” jibe by wondering if Lucifer would even want to accept Farage and co.
And he compared Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg to the leaders of the French Revolution, noting that those men “ended up on the guillotine”.
He’s not a fan of Labour Leaver Kate Hoey either.
And he's picked out Rees-Mogg individually for criticism.
But more than any one person, Verhofstadt just hates Brexit in general.
You can’t imagine Theresa May being so fiery on Twitter...
In Moscow there are 20 new sites for marriage registration.
In the list of sites – Ostankino TV tower, a mansion in Volkhonka, Moscow planetarium, the House of music.
The correspondent of “MIR 24” Anna Purpura visited the most unusual ceremonies.
This March stadium haven’t heard: instead of football sounds wedding.
And play on the field and cheer for the same team – Alexandra and Olga, Belenko.
In a football style everything from vases to flowers to stand under the basket.
Even the costumes of the newlyweds in the colors of their favorite team.
“It is fantastic. This is the class that all you can think of. And these emotions and feelings will remain. It is impossible to forget,” say the couple.
For a pair of dancing cheerleaders.
And commenter at the site who is not every match is worthy.
True, he’s a bit nervous for the first time at the stadium in this role.
“In the match you know exactly what’s going on. And here’s a solemn, important moment. People focus on the procedure that someone happens few times in my life, but it is better to have one,” says sports commentator Georgy Cherdantsev.
Instead of simply dresses and heels – free jacket and sneakers.
To change into a dress of the red Queen, and the Registrar’s office to change on the historic estate, Julia surpassed dozens of competitors to write the best speech.
It turns out that wanting to work at such celebrations all lined up.
Even had to hold a competition among registrars.
“Today it’s unbelievable. For us it is a personal holiday. Because it’s a different atmosphere. We are plunged into the atmosphere of fairy tales”, – said the chief specialist of wedding Palace No. 5 Julia Blokhina.
And these thematic wedding venues in Moscow 20.
Each with their own style.
“Young will have to pay only the state fee of 350 rubles, and the rest we take care. Organize, prepare these sites for yourself,” says the head of the registry office of Moscow Elena Efremova.
Today at the field sites recorded 500 pairs.
And then the employees of the registry office awaiting wedding boom.
Because such holidays is yet another argument in favor of formal relations.
Did you know the condom is over 5,000 years old?
That's right, some of the first forms of birth control date back to around 3,000 BC, and while the condom has made some strides since the Bronze Age, men still don't have a much better option all these millennia later.
Besides a vasectomy.
Especially compared to the pills, IUDs, and implants available to women today.
So why don't we have birth control for men?
In 2002, researchers asked more than 9,000 men across four continents whether they'd be willing to use contraception capable of preventing sperm production.
Over half said yes.
So the problem isn't lack of interest, it's partly human biology.
Women ovulate just one or two eggs each month.
Men, on the other hand, produce sperm daily, and it's not just one or two.
There's literally hundreds of millions of sperm produced each day, so because there's so many sperm produced, actually, you can reduce your sperm number over 90% and still be completely fertile.
Narrator: To reach infertility, a man's sperm count needs to be somewhere around 1 to 10 million per milliliter, but getting there is near impossible, at least without side effects.
That's because sperm count is tied to the production of testosterone.
In the past, researchers tried decreasing testosterone in an effort to decrease sperm count.
The problem is you don't have any libido, you have very little testosterone to act on other tissues and so forth, and so the side effects were so dramatic that it really wasn't ever going to be a contraceptive pill.
Narrator: Scientists also tried using different compounds that attack the cells that produce sperm.
But again, biology got in the way.
Germ cells, as they're called, developed inside a fortress-like structure within the testes.
So literally, nothing can get through it.
There's been a lot of small molecule studies to try and actually attack the germ cell to stop it from working.
Literally, I can think of 10 or 15 different compounds that actually have been developed to do that, but they don't work because of that barrier.
Narrator: But the complex male anatomy isn't the only problem.
It's also funding or lack thereof.
In 2002, two big pharmaceutical companies took interest in male contraception, Schering and Organon.
And together they funded a large clinical trial on a hormone-based contraceptive, offering hope that a pill backed by Big Pharma might be on the horizon.
Then these two companies became, as you know, acquired by bigger company, and then even bigger company, so now they are merged in huge companies, and women's health is still a priority in many of the companies, but men's health became part of the general matter of health.
And therefore, the development of contraception becomes a really very low priority.
Narrator: According to Dr. Wang, male contraception was also too risky for Big Pharma at the time.
The long-term side effects were unknown.
Companies were concerned that women might not trust it, and despite the survey results, it was unclear whether men would actually use a hormone-based contraception.
Today, the limited funding comes mostly from government agencies like the National Institutes of Health.
But there are in fact some promising lines of research.
Dr. Wang is working on a gel that can lower testosterone where it matters, in the testes where sperm is produced, while keeping testosterone levels normal elsewhere.
That means low sperm count and, more importantly, no major side effects.
We have preliminary studies to show that if we give the gel and if the man applies the gel, 90% of the men will reach the level that you talk about, 1 million per mil.
And Skinner is pursuing a new approach, shutting down Sertoli cells, which are a part of that impenetrable barrier that houses germ cells.
So if you shut down the Sertoli cell, then you shut down the sperm production.
Narrator: But perhaps most promising is a sort of reversible vasectomy that's in the works.
So they have this ability to inject this gel into what's called the vas deferens, and it makes this plug, so then essentially it does the same thing, but you're not cutting it.
Then believe it or not, you can actually inject this chemical mixture, which will dissolve the plug, and so then you can get your fertility back.
Narrator: But as promising as these approaches may be, they're still years, if not decades, out, Skinner says.
And without more funding, some of them may never hit the market.
So at least for now, men are left with few options.
Irreversible vasectomies, pulling out , and that slightly updated Bronze Age invention.
Last weekend, a group of Americans embarked on road trip to Canada — but not to take in the sights of northwestern Ontario.
They came to buy insulin.
It was worth the long journey, because the price of the diabetes medication they need is so much cheaper north of the border.
The group called themselves the Caravan to Canada.
Lija Greenseid, one of the participants, came to buy a type of insulin for her daughter that's not covered by her U.S. health insurance.
She spoke with As it Happens host Carol Off about the trip.
Here is part of their conversation.
How far did you travel to buy this insulin in Canada?
We drove about 300 miles each way, for 10 hours total for our trip.
So was it worth it, this so-called Caravan to Canada?
Absolutely it was.
So, first of all I got to buy some insulin that I otherwise can't buy here in the United States with my insurance.
So that's really helpful to me and to my daughter with Type 1 diabetes.
And also, I think it's working because we're raising a lot of attention to the problem of the high insulin prices here in the United States.
How many people went with you?
They were a total of six of us — either people with diabetes, or people like myself who have children or others with diabetes.
Lija Greenseid holds up the insulin medications she purchased on her trip to Ontario as a member of the #Insulin4all Caravan to Canada.
(Submitted by Lija Greenseid.)
Just give us some ideas of how much cheaper it is to buy the insulin in Canada than it is in the United States.
It's about one-tenth the cost.
So a vial of NovoRapid in Canada costs about $30 US, and in the United States that same vial — It's called NovoLog — costs about $300.
One of my friends, Quinn — she is paying about $600 a month for insulin.
And she was able to bring back with her a three-month supply and saved about $3,000 for her insulin.
There are a couple others that were like that as well, who bought ... many months of supply for themselves to use.
I personally bought a type of insulin that our insurance won't cover here in the United States.
It's a backup type of insulin that we'd use if my daughter's insulin pump were to fail.
And I'm very grateful to be able to buy exactly the right type that I want to be able to have for her, that we've always used in the past — instead of the new type that our insurance is now only going to cover.
So, in your case, hundreds of dollars.
In the cases of some of the other people, thousands of dollars — for very short periods of time of the insulin supply.
Is that typical of what people are facing in the United States?
It is typical.
There are many of us who are insured, and have what we call a high-deductible health insurance plan.
So we pay for the first $7,000 of my daughter's health needs each year.
And that's becoming more and more the case that the costs — upfront costs — are being passed off to American patients.
So last year, my family paid $27,000 for our health-care insurance premiums, and for medications and hospitalizations and everything else for my family.
And the issue with insulin, though, is that it's getting more expensive to buy.
Why is that in the United States?
Well, all health-care costs keep going up in the United States.
And really, frankly, the reason why is because we don't have a government way of regulating or putting any price caps on prescription drugs, so the price continues to increase.
The type of insulin that my daughter uses — there are only two manufacturers worldwide of a similar type.
And they continue to increase their prices lockstep together.
This has been going on for many years now, and I think we're finally at the breaking point where the cost is just too high for too many people.
And there have been reports in the U.S. Congress about this — that the price of insulin is so high, that people are rationing their insulin due to that.
And that this is across the United States, then?
That's correct.
There's been some research recently that about one in four people with diabetes are rationing their insulin in the United States.
And as we know, if people with diabetes don't have enough insulin, their blood sugar will be high — and that can result in some terrible long term complications, such as blindness and amputation and kidney disease.
In the short term, if someone with Type 1 diabetes doesn't have enough insulin, they can die.
Greenseid (far left) with other members of the #Insulin4all Caravan to Canada.
(Submitted by Lija Greenseid.)
And there's a very sad story here in Minnesota of a young man, Alex Smith, who lost his mother's insurance when he turned 26 years old, and rationed his insulin and died within a month of losing insurance.
He had gone to a pharmacy to fill his prescription and it was going to be $1,300.
He only had $1,000 in his bank account, and tried to use insulin sparingly to get through to payday.
But he didn't make it.
Oh, that's tragic.
Insurance companies in the U.S. have acknowledged that insulin prices are out of control.
Are they doing anything to try to rein them in?
There's been more efforts recently, as there's been increased pressure from patients.
But there are many people who still are paying too much.
And without a broader coordinated effort, I fear that there will always be some who slip through the cracks and aren't able to get the insulin that they need.
The love of a child’s parents is always going to be important in that child’s upbringing.
And society is always going to promote proper parenthood for all kids.
But as much as we would want to believe that all parents are going to love their children unconditionally, this is a very clear delusion.
Even though kids are always deserving of love, not all parents are going to be so willing to love their kids in the manner that they deserve.
Not all people are going to be mature enough to raise kids.
And not all people who have kids might actually be prepared to fulfill the roles and responsibilities that come with adulthood.
As rough as it might be to believe, parents aren’t perfect.
And a lot of the time, their imperfections can lead to some very poor upbringings for kids.
Some parents won’t necessarily be very effective in the way that they would love and guide their kids.
There are some parents who will have substantial weaknesses and emotional baggage that might impair their abilities to be effective guardians for their kids.
Some parents might actually struggle with mental health conditions, addictions, personality disorders, and much more.
And as a result, the parents who are unprepared to raise kids aren’t really going to do a very good job in preparing their kids for the treacheries of adulthood.
And these kids are left to fend for themselves and acquire skills that are quite difficult to learn.
These kids have to learn how to be more sociable, how to handle their feelings in a healthy manner, and how to view a mature and healthy perspective of the world.
Kids have to learn how to be decent human beings and have proper morals and ethics.
However, it’s very difficult to acquire these personality traits without having proper guidance and support from an adult.
And sometimes, kids can stray down a dark path without their knowing.
The results of straying down these paths can be catastrophic.
These kids can find themselves in emotionally overwhelming situations that might potentially cause some serious trauma and harm upon them.
And this is especially true for women.
In a patriarchal society, it’s much more difficult for a woman to make it out on her own.
And she might be carrying a lot of the trauma of her difficulties along with her as she becomes an adult.
But the worst part is that the trauma might impact whatever relationships she gets into in the future.
Not a lot of people might think that a child feeling unloved at a young age can have long-lasting effects that carry over into that particular child’s future.
But it’s true.
Emotional wounds take a very long time to heal especially when they’re left unresolved or unaddressed.
That’s why even while they’re adults, women who were unloved as kids can have some serious emotional baggage with them.
1. She will have trust issues.
She is a girl who is going to struggle with trusting the people around her.
Not being loved in the past has made her feel hurt and vulnerable.
And because of all the pain and vulnerability that she feels, she is going to find it difficult to trust the people she meets.
2. She will have commitment issues.
She is going to deeply struggle with commitment issues.
She isn’t really going to want to attach herself towards other people.
She doesn’t really know what it means to be able to invest herself in another human being.
And it’s all because she never really got to experience love in the past.
3. She will be very fearful and anxious.
A girl who doesn’t feel loved is always going to feel fearful and anxious.
She is going to be afraid of taking risks because she doesn’t know how she would cope with failure.
She doesn’t know what it means to feel safe and secure as a result of being love.
And that’s why she struggles with fear and anxiety a lot.
4. She will struggle with the idea of boundaries.
She isn’t really going to have any idea of how to set or enforce boundaries within a relationship.
She is going to have very poor self-esteem.
She won’t really know much about her individuality as a result of not being loved as a child.
And she wouldn’t really be able to tell if she’s being violated or disrespected.
5. She will have a poor sense of self.
A girl who grew up not being loved by her parents is going to find it really difficult to love herself.
She doesn’t know what it means to be loved and appreciated.
And so, she won’t really know how to engage in self-love and self-care.
She won’t really know how to demand respect and proper treatment from the people around her either.
Scientists are setting a new course in their quest to treat Alzheimer's disease.
The shift comes out of necessity.
A series of expensive failures with experimental drugs aimed at a toxic protein called amyloid-beta have led to a change in approach.
The most recent disappointment came in March, when drugmaker Biogen and its partner Eisai announced they were halting two large clinical trials of an amyloid drug called aducanumab.
It was like being punched in the stomach, says Phil Gutis, 57, an Alzheimer's patient in one of the trials.
Participating in this trial, it gave me hope for the future.
Gutis, who once was a reporter for The New York Times and worked as an advocate at the American Civil Liberties Union, had hoped the experimental drug would preserve some of his remaining memories.
I'm just being erased, he says.
The day before the aducanumab trial ended, Gutis had been leafing through pictures of his dog, Abe, a Jack Russell terrier who died last year.
He was trying to remember the companion who'd shared his life for 12 years.
But there were no memories, he says.
And then I told a friend about this and she said, 'You don't remember walking on the trail and how he used to scamper ahead and try to trip you?' And I'm like, no, I don't.
The failure of aducanumab was a huge letdown for both patients and researchers.
Even though previous amyloid drugs had faltered, this one had a remarkable ability to remove the toxic protein from the brain.
And preliminary studies had suggested it might also slow the progression of dementia.
So the end of aducanumab appears to signal the end of the era in which pharmaceutical companies poured billions into amyloid drugs.
The scientists have largely said, 'OK, we give up,'
Gutis says.
Now the question is: What comes next?
And scientists say there is a wide range of potential answers.
Current strategies include everything from modulating the brain's immune system to finding drugs that can protect healthy brain cells from toxins.
Dealing with the amyloid is probably important, but it's not going to be sufficient, says Dr. Daniel Alkon, president and chief scientific officer of the biotechnology company Neurotrope.
Before helping to found Neurotrope, Alkon spent decades as a researcher at the National Institutes of Health and then the Blanchette Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute at West Virginia University.
His research focused on memory formation and the wiring that allows brain cells to communicate.
And that led him to focus on a key feature of Alzheimer's that didn't involve amyloid.
One of the earliest events in Alzheimer's disease is the loss of that wiring, Alkon says.
And as the wiring loss progresses the cognitive function loss progresses.
So Alkon and a team of scientists studied mice that had been genetically altered to develop a condition similar to Alzheimer's.
And he says they realized something surprising.
You saw this very significant loss of wiring and you could actually reverse it, he says.
You could regenerate the wiring.
The brain did this by creating new connections between brain cells.
And this process was controlled by a naturally occurring protein called PKC-epsilon.
Alkon's team thought if they could find a way to tweak PKC-epsilon, maybe they could get the brain to replace some of the wiring lost in Alzheimer's.
We asked, is there any known drug in the world that can target PKC-epsilon safely, without hurting a patient, Alkon says.
And they found one.
It's called bryostatin-1 and it comes from a tiny marine animal often mistaken for seaweed.
Decades ago, researchers at the National Cancer Institute studied bryostatin as a treatment for cancer.
That effort didn't work out.
But Alkon thought bryostatin might work for Alzheimer's because it was really good at activating PKC-epsilon.
So his team tried it, first on animals and then a small group of people, including a man named Frank.
He had been sitting in a chair staring at the ceiling, hallucinating, Alkon says.
Within a couple of weeks of our treating him he started swimming, playing pool, communicating, feeding himself.
Two preliminary studies hinted that patients with advanced Alzheimer's could get better with bryostatin.
And a more rigorous study of about 150 people suggested a modest benefit for some.
So now Neurotrope is working to confirm those results in another trial.
And, of course, bryostatin is just one potential treatment, says Dr. Steven Arnold, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.
Several other experimental drugs target a toxic substance called tau that builds up inside the brain cells of Alzheimer's patients, he says.
And still others target inflammation or brain cells' mechanisms for clearing out toxins.
These are all really powerful ways in which we can perhaps prevent, delay or even reverse Alzheimer disease, Arnold says.
Some of the experimental drugs may have applications beyond Alzheimer's.
That's because these drugs are intended to protect brain cells from a variety of threats and help them function better.
If we do that, we may find that it's not only good for Alzheimer disease but it's also good for other degenerative conditions of the brain, like Parkinson's disease, Arnold says.
In the meantime, Alzheimer's patients like Gutis, who now serves as an advocate for the Alzheimer's Association, continue to look for anything that might help.
Gutis was devastated when the drug trial he'd been in was halted.
But asked if he'd enroll in another trial he says, "I would. In a second."
Despite being a child that did not agree with being naughty, Where the Wild Things Are became one of my favorite books.
From Max in his wolf costume chasing after his dog, to wild things hanging off trees and roaring their terrible roars, I saw my desires enacted on the page.
I wanted to roar.
I wanted to act up and be bad.
I wanted to be queen of the wild things.
Except without repercussions.
And I could be, in my imagination.
I became Max as I read, and enacted the wild things within me that I couldn’t in public, something I continue to do today, if with different books.
Where the Wild Things Are is rightfully iconic and memorable, playing an important part in many children’s reading lives.
It wasn’t until I started working in a used bookstore that I discovered how vast Maurice Sendak’s bibliography was, and when I started collecting his books.
Now, I own about thirty Maurice Sendak books, including several first editions and one signed.
I recently gave my one-year-old the same wild thing stuffed animal I had as a kid, and read Wild Things to her for the first time.
I look forward to reading his books with her when she’s a little older, and asking her what she thinks.
We can dress as our own wild things, and romp through the house on a wild rumpus, together.
For many, our memories of reading Maurice Sendak books begin and end with Where the Wild Things Are , published in 1963 and winner of the Caldecott Award.
But his bibliography extends far beyond the wild rumpus.
In fact, he had illustrated over 40 books by then, and had authored and illustrated seven.
In the very first book he authored, Kenny’s Window, Kenny goes on a quest to find a garden from his dreams, with the help of his stuffed animals.
But can he answer seven questions posed by a rooster?
The dream world is explored in many of his picture books, where Sendak’s embrace of the nonsensical is fully developed.
In my favorite of his earliest works, The Sign on Rosie’s Door, four chapters chronicle Rosie’s adventures pretend playing as her alter ego Alinda with her often annoying friends from the neighborhood.
Told almost completely through dialogue, Sendak captures child play perfectly.
His last four books before Wild Things are contained in The Nutshell Library, perfect for little toddler hands.
These are illustrated much more simply than Wild Things , with minimal coloring, sparse backgrounds, and expressive child faces.
But he had plenty of experience illustrating at that point, with more than 40 collaborations with authors and working at FAO Schwarz creating children’s window displays.
In A Hole is to Dig by Ruth Krauss, an author he frequently collaborated with, he utilized the same crosshatching technique he would later implement in Wild Things , and it’s a super cute book, another small sized book aimed at preschoolers.
He also illustrated the famous Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle’s Farm by Betty MacDonald.
And he illustrated my favorite early readers series—Little Bear by Else Holmelund Minarik.
Minarik’s simple and sweet stories pair beautifully with Sendak’s expressive little bear.
In fact, there’s something very Max-like in the upright Little Bear.
While the only book Sendak authored to win the Caldecott Award was Where the Wild Things Are , In the Night Kitchen (1970) is a Caldecott honor book, and is his second most well-known book, as well as the most banned.
I read In the Night Kitchen in elementary school.
I remember the red haired school librarian reading it to the class, and later I remember reading it by myself.
Like many young children, authors meant nothing.
I didn’t notice the name Maurice Sendak on the page and associate it with Where the Wild Things Are .
It was just another book to read that I found confusing but also enjoyable.
My favorite children’s books were often those that left me scratching my head.
If I’d been a discerning child, I would’ve noticed that Mickey from Night Kitchen looked awfully similar to Max, and that just like in Wild Things , the pages with Mickey at home are small, but once he enters his dreamworld with the bakers, the illustrations fill the page, the bakers—like the wild things—looming over-large and over-smiling.
Night Kitchen doesn’t use the same crosshatch drawing style as Wild Things ; instead, the illustrations are dark and vivid and bold.
And here again we have the dreamworld theme.
In the Night Kitchen is banned because Mickey doesn’t wear clothes in his dream.
But I don’t remember giving Mickey’s penis a second thought as a child.
Instead, I examined the buildings in the background—a tea kettle filled with windows, a tall square building called “CAKE” with beaters on top, a building called “TA-KA-KAKE” (“What’s ta-ka-kake?”
I thought. A sugar corn flour cake, it turns out).
As usual, people who ban books make a mountain out of nonexistent problems.
Six-year-olds have seen plenty of naked toddlers.
We know what they look like.
The only ones offended are the narrow-minded adults.
A few years before Night Kitchen was published, Sendak wrote and illustrated the hilarious chapter book Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More To Life.
In it, Jennie the dog decides despite living the perfect doggie existence, she must go out and see the world and experience life.
Once traveling, she sets her heart on becoming the leading lady in The World Mother Goose Theatre.
But she’s got to pick up some experience first.
It’s just as fun to read as an adult than as a child.
He based the character on his own Sealyham Terrier, Jennie.
A lifetime lover of dogs, Sendak often featured his beloved pets in his picture books.
In the world of illustrated books, he began collaborating with author and poet Randall Jarrell, a collaboration they would continue through 4 books.
These books make wonderful introductions to poetry for elementary students, particularly The Bat-Poet.
The half bathroom is inching closer and closer to being finished!
The one big thing hanging over my head is still the floor, but I have a few more things I still want to get finished before I tackle that huge project.
I finished painting and adding the resin coating on all of the tile, let it cure for a couple of days, and  then got most of it installed.
But something still seemed “off” about the whole thing — the yellow chair rail, yellow tile and yellow lower wall.
The yellow tile seemed bright and cheerful, but the yellow chair rail and wall looked dull.
That seemed strange since it was literally the exact same paint color out of the same container.
And yet, it looked dull on the painted finishes.
So I tried the chair rail in white, and I loved it!
I had rejected the idea of white wainscoting before because it just looked so boring against the upper walls.
And I do love white wainscoting, as you can see in the music room and hallway bathroom.
But in this bathroom, it just seemed so… blah .
But as it turns out, just the addition of the yellow tile with the white wainscoting was all it needed to take it from blah to bright and interesting to my eye.
So I painted the lower wall white as well to get the full picture of what it would look like.
This was after one coat of white on the lower walls, but it already looked so much brighter.
And of course, the addition of all of the bright painted trim (picture frame molding, baseboards) will complete the look.
Speaking of trim, I finally cut the access panel in the wall behind the toilet.
This was the whole reason this bathroom had to have wainscoting in the first place.
If not for the need for this access panel (due to the special plumbing required in this bathroom), I wouldn’t have chosen to do wainscoting with picture frame molding in a room with such busy upper walls.
But I couldn’t think of a better way to disguise the required access panel than with picture frame molding.
So after cutting the panel out of the drywall, I trimmed the edges of the cut out piece with base cap molding, and then put it back in place.
I still need to come up with a way to keep it in place.
Right now, I just have a tiny piece of wood shim wedged in there so that the panel won’t fall out.
I’m still trying to figure out a more permanent solution for holding that panel in place.
I also got the window casing installed, although I still need to caulk and paint.
That window casing is another reason I decided to try the white on the chair rail and lower walls.
I knew that with the addition of the tile backsplash/accent around the room, that would put the chair rail up much higher, which wouldn’t allow for a full apron under the window.
I couldn’t imagine the window casing in white with a narrow little apron up against a yellow chair rail.
That would have just highlighted the narrow apron.
With the window trim and the chair rail white, it better disguises the narrow apron under the window.
And of course, it’ll look better once it’s all caulked and painted.
Today, I hope to continue with the trim and get all of that installed (including the crown molding), get the tile grouted, and get the second coat of resin on the countertop.
And speaking of the countertop, I’ve decided to give the final coat of resin a matte finish.
Resin generally has a very shiny and reflective finish, which you can see here… But yesterday, I watched a video about how to get a matte finish in resin.
I’ve done it myself before, but that was for the huge piece of artwork that hangs in my music room… But even after sanding that resin to a satin finish, it never dawned on me to try that on a countertop.
But in the video I watched, they said that a matte finish would hide scratches on a resin countertop (obviously), so I’m going to try it.
I decided to test the look by sanding the right side of the countertop by hand with 220-grit sandpaper, and it looks pretty amazing… It’s hard to see the full effect in pictures, but there’s not a bit of shine or reflection on that side of the countertop.
It’s just pure matte goodness.
Of course, the sanded resin will have to be waxed, so it will probably end up being more of a satin finish.
But it will still be better at hiding scratches than a really shiny, highly reflective surface.
So that’s the progress!
I’m definitely on the downhill slide towards the finish line with this, but again, I won’t be able to get it completely finished until the floor is done.
Ugh!
Stupid floor!
I hate it when a huge, daunting project holds up progress.
If it weren’t for the floor, I could probably have the bathroom done by the end of the weekend.
Again..ugh!
So, I had a mediation scheduled for yesterday, and I've known it was coming up for the last few weeks.
It was nerve-wracking the last couple weeks knowing that I was going into it yesterday, and I lost a lot of sleep coming up with irrational ways that I'd get screwed over.
And while I launched what I felt was a good initial offer to her, I got an absolute no-faith offer sent back.
I honestly just about walked out twice looking at some of the things she was asking for.
But I bit my tongue and counter-offered for about four hours.
Four, long-ass hours.
And we got it settled.
I do have to sell my house as I predicted, but the proceeds do pay off my own debt first, and then is split after that's settled.
And I am on the hook for a small amount of alimony for two years.
Custody was already settled going in.
But I'm free.
I'm free!
No more of her slob behavior and clothes all over the place, leaving dirty dishes in the bedroom, and barely cooking a thing for my kids.
And no more dead bedroom.
I've actually met someone online that I like a lot, and she knows my reddit name (hey out there!).
It's going to get so much better.
I know it.
I was scared as hell at points, but I made it happen.
And you all can too.
The dead bedroom is no more!
I remember having measles as a kid.
Believe me, it was no fun.
Also, measles could cause birth defects if a pregnant women got infected.
If you were elderly, measles could be fatal.
Eventually, after vaccinations became nearly universal in America, measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000.
But now the measles are back – already surpassing 700 cases this year, in 22 states.
So far, 66 people have been hospitalized, a third of them with pneumonia.
What happened?
We stopped vaccinating everyone.
More than 500 of the new cases are in people who had not been vaccinated.
Last Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention renewed an urgent call for parents to have their children vaccinated.
We stopped vaccinating all children because some parents have had religious objections.
Others haven’t liked the idea of injecting a live virus into their little ones.
Some just never got around to it.
And some parents – succumbing to growing skepticism about science and burgeoning conspiracy theories – believe vaccinations cause autism.
The claim has been promoted by Russian internet trolls as well as Donald Trump.
In a 2015 presidential debate, Trump told of an employee with a two-year-old daughter who “went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic”.
Trump has finally stopped pushing this lie.
Last week he tersely said “they have to get the shots”, which is about as much of a concession to the truth anyone can expect from America’s liar-in-chief.
In reality there’s zero evidence connecting measles vaccine to autism.
Let’s be clear.
To eradicate measles – and other dread diseases such as tuberculosis, polio and tetanus (which also protects from whooping cough and diphtheria) – parents must have their children vaccinated.
Parents have a right to choose what happens to their own children, of course.
But the right isn’t absolute.
Parents who abuse their children may lose custody of them.
Courts have ordered that children with cancer receive chemotherapy despite their parent’s objections.
There are also the interests of other children and of society overall.
Measles travels through the air.
The virus can live for hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed.
The core issue here is the common good.
If enough people are vaccinated, everyone benefits.
But if enough people decide to opt out of vaccinations, for whatever reason, they put everyone at a higher risk of contracting disease.
So what’s the incentive to get yourself and your child vaccinated when you might prefer to rely on everyone else vaccinating themselves and their kids instead?
Partly it’s laws that make vaccination compulsory.
Yet right now only three states require vaccinations for children to attend kindergarten without any nonmedical exceptions.
Most states give parents a pass if they have religious objections.
Nearly 20 states don’t even require that objections be religious – any objection will do.
So the first step is for all states to require vaccinations, or for the federal government to step in and make them mandatory.
But not even a universal legal requirement would be adequate if enough parents were determined to thwart it.
So at the most fundamental level, vaccination comes down to a duty inherent in being a member of a society.
In all sorts of ways, each of us might prefer to rely on everyone else doing certain things so we don’t have to – whether following mundane norms such as not littering or of giving up our seat on the bus to an older person, or simply obeying laws that are rarely or inadequately enforced, or taking on more heroic roles like teaching in a poor school, being a social worker, serving in the armed services or acting as a first responder.
The idea of the common good was once widely understood and accepted in America.
After all, the US constitution was designed for “We the people” seeking to “promote the general welfare” – not for “me the selfish person seeking to do whatever I want for myself and my family”.
Yet the common good is no longer a fashionable idea.
We celebrate our personal freedom on Independence Day but pay less heed to our interdependence.
We relish our bill of rights but are less attentive to what might be called our bill of responsibilities.
Some demagogues insist our national identity depends on the whiteness of our skin, our European heritage and our English language.
And on keeping “others” out.
Rubbish.
Our identity depends on the ideals we share and our willingness to sacrifice for the good we hold in common.
Measles are back, largely because some people have stopped vaccinating themselves and their kids against them.
Vaccination against measles and other dread diseases isn’t just a personal choice.
It’s a social responsibility.
If we really want to make America great again, social responsibility is the place to begin.
Kendall Jenner belongs to a dynasty that produced two of the most viral direct-to-consumer beauty lines in modern history: Kylie Cosmetics and KKW Beauty.
But Jenner will be the first to tell you that unlike the rest of the Kardashian women, her beauty routine is 100% fuss-free.
Sure, when I sit down with the model at an Ulta Beauty store in L.A. to celebrate her collaboration with the just-launched hair tool brand Formawell Beauty, her hair is immaculately tousled, her skin behind a living filter, her lashes defined to perfection, and her lips almost intimidatingly plump.
But this is a special day ( and the family's resident makeup guru Hrush Achemyan was there to help).
By contrast, Jenner's everyday approach to beauty is as relaxed as a day at the beach —so much so, in fact, that when I open my interview by asking her to name her "holy-grail desert island beauty products," Jenner begins listing the supplies she'd bring were she realistically shipwrecked on some abandoned coastline— and I don't have the heart to clarify that I was simply fishing for her current beauty favorites.
A lash curler?
Hrush suggests from offstage to which Jenner endearingly replies, "No! Who am I trying to impress on a desert island? I wouldn't want to put on makeup if I were on a desert island. I'd be focused on, like, getting out of there."
Jenner doesn't speak the typical beauty guru language of cut creases, chemical exfoliation, and desert island products—though she does have strong preferences when it comes to makeup, hair, and skin.
Keep scrolling for Jenner's low-maintenance beauty secrets , including her drugstore skincare essentials, her favorite summer trends, and her top beauty pet peeve.
What are your holy-grail desert island beauty products at the moment?
Ooh.
Well one of them's gotta be sunscreen for sure.
For my face, I actually just use the regular sunscreen I use on my body—Sun Bum.
All over my body and my face.
Then I'd need a hair tie, a scrunchie because you gotta get your hair out of your face.
I really like a scrunchie right now, and I never thought I'd say that—I was never into them.
But I really like a simple black silk one.
They don't dent your hair like a rubber band would.
Then maybe… Oh man, what do you need on a desert island?
Chapstick.
Because you're gonna get dehydrated out there.
Chapped lips.
And then a water bottle.
Water is a beauty product.
Do you have any beauty pet peeves?
Honestly?
Too much makeup on a pretty person.
On a pretty girl.
I mean, everyone's pretty, so I guess just too much makeup in general.
But like, sometimes I'll just see a really beautiful girl and she'll have SO much makeup on.
And you're like Why?
You're so pretty!
I suppose some faces just take makeup better.
Totally.
I mean, I have five sisters who take makeup really well.
But like I said, they're very beautiful, and sometimes I see them with so much makeup and I'm like Why?
You don't need it.
My sisters and I will always be on different pages with makeup.
Though I have learned from them to experiment more and get funky sometimes.
What's your number one skincare concern and what do you use to treat it?
Acne is definitely one of them, and I use Proactiv.
Then I feel like everyone hates dry skin.
I hate to be dry.
So a really good moisturizer, or even something more hardcore if you need it: Aquaphor is very multipurpose, so I'll use that if I have a patch.
What is your go-to lazy day hairstyle?
We were talking about scrunchies—maybe pulling it up in a scrunchie because it makes it cuter than just a regular pony.
Or a big clip.
Like an alligator clip?
Yes.
Whatever those are called.
A big one.
What summer 2019 beauty trends are you loving right now?
Just like that cool-girl style that's happening right now—girls who are wearing not too much and are really glowy.
And then maybe like a bright colored eye shadow or a colored liner and nothing else.
I think that's really cool.
Are there any trends you're seeing that you would never wear?
Let's see.
I'm kind of into everything I'm seeing.
I love big eyebrows.
I love glossy skin.
I'm into all of it.
There's not much going wrong right now.
If I gave you $25 to shop for beauty products at the drugstore, what would you buy?
I'm really into little tools.
I just got these really cheap little peach fuzz razors because I have a stash.
Gotta get rid of it.
Maybe an eyelash curler and a lash comb.
I'm all about my lashes, clearly.
They're my biggest thing.
I'm wearing Lancôme Hypnôse Drama ($28) mascara right now, and my makeup artist] Hrush added a couple individual falsies to the ends for today, but normally I just wear mascara.
And I do them myself.
Because they're too—I'm not complaining—they're too long sometimes.
They have good days and bad days, so sometimes I just feel like I need to do them because they need to be tamed.
The national statistics overall show that mood disorders among children, adolescents and young adults have increased significantly over the past 10 years.
If you asked me in 30 seconds to describe the biggest challenge to us in the mental-health arena, it would be that area.
But a youngster who is depressed, a youngster who feels that death is better than life, can end up dying.
That’s the single biggest area that’s of concern to us.
Now, there’s some pretty significant racial and gender differences there.
Among males it was 5.1 percent.
Among females it was 9.3 percent.
Among African-Americans it was 9.8 percent, among white teenagers it was 6.1 percent.
Among what is called sexual minorities, it was 35 percent.
These are extraordinarily high numbers of our young people who have a couple things in common.
No. 1, they generally feel as if they are a burden to other people.
No. 2, they don’t have the relationships with caring individuals that get most of us through the tough times.
And then finally No. 3, they have come to some accommodation that death is better than life, generally because they feel that the pain that they are experiencing today will go on forever.
(Most adults) know one thing: whether today is a good day or a bad day, it’s going to pass.
Kids don’t feel that way, so the pain they feel, again with this anxiety and depression, they feel will go on forever.
There’s no relief in sight, therefore I’d just as soon be dead.
The research on technology and social media is now complete.
It is a major factor leading to mood disorders in teenagers.
Period. We need not debate that anymore.
That’s not to say that all technology and all social media are bad for all kids.
But it is to say beyond a tipping point, kids spending so much time in social media is significantly related to these mood disorders.
And the way it works is almost common sense.
The more time you’re spending on that, you’re not interacting in person.
So you’re not building up the relationships that get us through our tough times.
If you’re texting someone or you’re on social media or you’re getting support from a friend rather than a family member, it doesn’t have that same qualitative thing.
Not to say that we should suddenly take our kids away from technology, but we need to place limits on it and we need to teach them how to be responsible digital citizens.
I think most people would agree that’s a factor.
I think the question’s been answered.
Other people are not quite so definitive.
But my reading of the literature says that’s a major factor.
I think well-meaning and loving parents have over-protected our kids and not allowed them the gift of dealing with failure and frustration at a younger age, leaving them ill-equipped as they enter the tougher teen years to deal with real-life situations.
The end result is, I’ve never learned to get up after falling because my parents never let me fall.
When I do fall, I think, “Oh my goodness, the world’s coming to an end.”
So-called “helicopter parenting” … It may make parents and kids feel good in the moment.
But it’s a harmful way of raising kids, because it doesn’t teach them the skill of resiliency.
And the third and final factor … there’s a fascinating increase, well-documented, in kids’ trait of perfectionism.
Perfectionism meaning, I expect myself to be perfect, I expect you to be perfect and I think that you expect me to be perfect.
And by definition since that’s an ideal we can never fully achieve, when things don’t reach that ideal, kids feel badly and act on those feelings.
So those are kind of the three things that I think are at work.
And again, different people will rank those differently.
I get asked all the time what can parents do — and the answer is simple, but doing it is difficult.
And that’s to stay engaged with your youngster.
To raise them in such a way where you are an askable parent and kids feel like they can say things to you that reveal a little bit of who they are.
So that when the times do get tough, they have you.
It’s tough.
And for some kids, frankly, it’s tougher than others.
For the most part it’s not a matter of bad parents or bad kids, it’s a matter of kids encountering normal situations but not being equipped to deal with them.
Whenever I travel somewhere new, I check out Instagram to see what kind of photos people are posting in the location.
Specifically, I check out Instagram to see what kind of food photos people are posting in the location.
Instagram lets me see what’s hot and trendy in each location and helps me come up with a list of spots I want to stop at.
But I admit that I also spend far too long looking at worldwide food trends on Instagram when I’m sitting at home simply lusting over my next hypothetical travel destination.
And lately, there’s one food trend I’ve been seeing a lot of: Bubble waffles.
Bubble waffles first became popular in Hong Kong, but the trend is spreading quickly and these super fun treats are all over the place now.
So, when Pampered Chef reached out to me and asked me to team up with them to try out their new Waffle Puff Pan, I immediately agreed.
I couldn’t wait to make my own bubble waffles and see why this trend is taking over the food world.
I contemplated what to make for quite a while as so many exciting ideas were popping into my mind.
I almost made raspberry swirl bubble waffle ice cream cones.
Then I almost made fried chicken savory bubble waffle cones.
But I ultimately decided to make bubble waffle banana split tacos.
This was my first time using a waffle puff pan.
In fact, it was my first time using an actual waffle pan as I generally use electric waffle makers.
With the Pampered Chef’s Waffle Puff Pan, you simply use it over your stovetop.
But don’t worry, the square pan has a well to catch batter spills, so you won’t have any messes on your stovetop.
It also comes with a nifty little nylon fork to help you lift your waffles from the pan once they’re done.
And since the pan has a PFOA-free ceramic nonstick coating, it’s super easy to remove the waffles.
In fact, this waffle pan is incredibly easy to use from start to finish!
If you check out the trend on Instagram, you’ll see that bubble waffles are most often used as ice cream cones.
But there’s SO much more you can do with them.
I made sweet funfetti taco shells with mine for these banana split bubble waffle tacos.
In addition to filling the bubble waffles with ice cream, bananas, strawberries, chocolate sauce, walnuts, whipped cream, and sprinkles, I decided to make the bubble waffles banana flavored, too.
I easily mixed up the liquid ingredients for the batter in my blender.
And then stirred the mixture together with the dry ingredients in a big bowl.
Once the batter was combined, I folded in some rainbow sprinkles.
Because any time I can make a food funfetti-style, I will be doing it.
And then I was ready to make my bubble waffles!
I started by spraying the Waffle Puff Pan with cooking spray and letting it heat up on my stovetop.
Once it’s heated, I poured the batter into the pan, filling all the bubbles, closed it, and flipped it over.
I let it cook for 3 minutes before flipping it again and letting it cook for another 3 minutes.
I open the pan and my bubble waffle was perfect!
How fun are these??
Obviously, you can leave them as is and eat them with some maple syrup and fruit for breakfast.
I love that these ones are banana flavored, but you can, of course, make plain ones (the Pampered Chef has a great recipe on their website) or use any add-ins that you want (like cookies!!).
But for these bubble waffle banana split tacos, I had to shape the waffles into taco shells.
As soon as they came out of the waffle maker, I gently folded them into a taco shell shape and set them in a little loaf pan so they’d stay in the folded shape.
As they cooled and hardened a bit, they maintained their shape.
Then I filled the taco shells!
I went all out here with vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry ice cream.
Then I topped the ice cream with sliced banana and strawberries and chopped walnuts and drizzled everything with chocolate sauce.
I added a healthy amount of whipped cream and sprinkled more rainbow sprinkles on top, along with a cherry.
I would never turn down any banana split, but after indulging in these bubble waffle banana split tacos, a plain old banana split will never be the same!
And when I say “indulge,” I mean it.
This dessert is the kind of thing you make when you really want to impress your guests and give them something to talk about.
Or post on Instagram.
It’s mainly a dessert, but I also think it would be a pretty fun addition to brunch.
They do say brunch is the most Instagrammable meal, right??
I’m so thrilled that I can now make bubble waffles any time I want and I can’t wait to check out all of the other products from Pampered Chef.
Did you know they have more than 400 high-quality products, including cookware, bakeware, stoneware, food preparation tools, pantry items, and more?
Something all their products have in common is that they make life easier for you and you don’t have to be an expert cook to use them!
They help you create memories… And really, really pretty Instagram photos.
Hello guys this is my third post on reddit.
Deleted my 2 post a while ago, because, 2 people commented and i dont know what to reply.
So last night I have unistalled my facebook app, my twitter app, instagram app, my clash of clans app, my mobile legends app, and even deleted my dota 2 and pubg app on my pc.
Why?
Because it reminds me of my ex.
Im (24 years old female, working in a university as a project staff) i have my first boyfriend (20 years old) He broke up with me.
For the reason that i want to meet his family.
Although he introduced me to his friends, but i want more.
I want to meet his mom and siblings.
But he doesnt like, he said that he is still not yet ready to introduce me, yes our relationship is private.
And it hurts so bad.
Now its already 9 months since our breakup.
But every night it hunts me, our memories together, i still cant sleep, its so hard to move on.
Till now he still keep liking and sends heart react in my instagram and facebook post.
(why what is the meaning of this)
So for the last 3 months im busy at work.
Already sleeping at our office because of my heavy work load and deadlines.
I wake up every morning to serve my boss to meet deadlines, to earn money for myself and for my family.
I push myself so hard at work and keep myself busy.
But why guys?????? Its hard to forget him.
They say keep yourself busy so that you can move on.
But guys, people on reddit, its not working.
What should i do.
I have my friends, i have my family to ask for advice, but im so afraid to tell them what i feel - that im a pathetic loser, i'm tired, im feel so empty, i feel so alone.
For many years I’ve had what you might call, “dealer phobia.”
It’s a condition that results from buying a car when you’re young and then naively taking it back to the dealer for service.
The service rep sort of walks around the car, then sizes you up, then takes a long pause.
And you just start wondering what he could be thinking about.
During this pause, you know he’s figuring out how to tell you the bad news, and you’re thinking: “What’s wrong? Is it serious? Maybe I need a new engine?”
You’re young, and you don’t know anything about cars, and you really don’t know what to expect, but you know one thing for certain, and that is: you trust the dealer!
He’s operating under a big Chevrolet logo, and Chevrolet vets all their dealers to make sure they’re honest, right?
What you learn later is that the service rep is sizing you up and thinking, “This kid is so young, I know he doesn’t have a job, therefore, he doesn’t have any money. And even if he has a job, he’s making minimum wage, and so he still won’t have any money. This kid really isn’t even worth my time.”
And while he’s thinking about whether he even wants to accept your car into his pristine shop, the car that has a pair of dirty underwear and a half-eaten dried-out pizza in the back seat, the service manager comes over and whispers in his ear.
You don’t know what the service manager is saying, but it reminds you of a movie where the Godfather whispers to Michael Corleone, and then somebody disappears as they cut to a scene with two guys using two shovels to dig a rectangular hole in the ground.
Then the service rep looks up at you and gives you a big smile, and says, “We’ll check it out and let you know! Do you have the key?”
Of course you have the key!
You drove in there, didn’t you?
So you leave the car, and they offer you a cup of coffee while you wait, and wait, and wait.
Finally you say, “Maybe I will take your offer of that shuttle after all.”
Then, around 4 p.m., the service manager calls you back and says, “I’m afraid we’re going to have to keep the car overnight. We have it apart, and we’re talking to the insurance company. The adjuster can’t get here until Thursday. Would you like to rent a car?”
You think, “Thursday? Just to have it ‘checked out?’” So you agree to rent a car, and they come back over and pick you up.
And you think, “I wonder how much all this is going to cost?”
A couple of days later, you get another call.
“Your car is all ready; you can pick it up.”
And you think – does that mean it’s fixed?
Of course it’s fixed you idiot – you’re at the dealer!
They fix things.
Now, you have already been to the other guys where they try to fix things.
The problem is they don’t have the manuals, they don’t have the parts, and they don’t have a mechanic who knows anything about your model car, much less your model year.
They do charge you less, but they don’t fix anything, so you have to bring it back, and bring it back, and pretty soon you’re in a full-blown relationship!
They tell you about their kids, they ask you about your dog, they wrap up in aluminum foil your dried pizza in the back seat, and the guy’s wife even washes and folds your dirty underwear.
You love this place.
If only they could fix your car in one visit!
Anyway, you’re back at the dealer, and you walk up to the service rep, and now he is a jokester – OMG, he’s got jokes, funny jokes, and you laugh.
Why?
Because you are even more nervous than he is.
But all the while you are wondering, what is the number – exactly – that this is going to lead to at the end of the joking?
You see him punching in numbers on the computer, recycling fees, taxes, disposal fees, more taxes, parts, labor – OMG.
You’ve got to be kidding!
How did it ever get to be that much?
That’s incredible.
You whip out your phone, flip to the calculator, add it up – yup.
It adds up right, so it must be correct.
Whew!
That’s a lot.
And now, how am I going to pay my tuition bill next week?
What do I do now, sell drugs?
Rob someone?
Sell my body?
How the hell am I ever going to pay this enormous freaking bill?
“ And the insurance?” you ask meekly.
“Sorry, didn’t cover it.”
Then you relax and ask, “Do you take plastic?” “Of course we do, sir – Visa, Mastercard, American Express – we take ‘em all.” “OK, well, let’s see if there is enough on this card – or maybe this card – well just split it between both of them. And here’s $20 in cash in case it doesn’t go through.”
So you walk away, and think: Wow, that was an expensive cup of coffee! How do I make sure I never have to experience that again?
I know, I’ll find a good mechanic that I can afford. He’s out there – somewhere; I just haven’t found him yet. But I’m going to keep looking…
For the last 6 years of my life, gas lighting has slowly lead to the detriment of my psyche to such an extent I don't know what's real anymore.
It's addictive, in a sense, as I feel obligated to know what "they" are up to or else I'll become uninformed.
And if that happens, if I don't know what causes to fight for, my life loses all meaning.
It would be one thing if this stayed in the realms of the internet, but I've been programmed to hear dog whistles in everyday conversations.
I wish I could treat my hobbies and relationships outside of the Internet and politics normally, but it's impossible.
I fear that my loved ones and friends are falling victim to propaganda and feel the need to silently inform strangers where I stand on issues.
What makes this worse is that these issues are not intrinsic to the ideology, but instead it's the internet and my brain.
I've radically changed beliefs but it still feels the same.
No matter the issue and no matter the stance I take, I always feel the same.
I often feel like I'm becoming more informed, a better citizen of the world, having a full understanding of the issue.
Give me a break.
I don't know *.
I just repeat what I've heard and pretend that I'm some sort of expert because I watch certain videos, read certain posts, and listen to certain people.
And I don't mean in a im14andthisisdeep type of way.
I'm not saying the evil internet is implanting ideas in my head or how "it's just like Orwell predicted".
I mean in a much more real way.
I'm talking buzz words.
Mantras.
Whatever you want to call them.
And what's worse is that some of these figureheads actually know what they're talking about.
But the communities around them are cease pools and people just repeat what they say and how they say it, but worse.
And because it's worse the ideas behind them are less sound.
But because in essence it's the same idea as before, people believe it's the same.
But it's so much easier to scrutinize that the "enemy" is easily able to pick it apart.
Therefore, no one believe's each others ideas have any merit.
Therefore, no progress is able to get made on the issue through dialogue.
**Sidenote: I'm really sorry this is sounding like a South Park or ENLIGHTENED CENTRISTS type of argument and I'm definitely not saying every idea is worth debating, especially those related to ethnic genocide ; Now, I'm not blaming the internet for my stupid mental issues or my life problems.
I just want a *ing break man. I'm tired of thinking like this.
But the issues I care about are REAL.
They impact REAL people, often those who I don't even know.
Indifference makes me feel guilty, as if I'm apart of the problem.
I don't have any goals or solutions to help the situation, oh no.
But actively not doing anything?
That's when my mental health is the worst.
Prior to 2000, the majority of China's industry was basically manufacturing businesses expanding from the Pearl River Delta to the Yangtze River Delta, and then onto Chengdu and Chongqing.
However, with the production ecosystem growing mature, many of the supporting sectors also started to take shape, giving a new outlet for China's industry.
In 2000, SMIC was founded in Shanghai, becoming the pioneer of China's semiconductor manufacturing industry.
In 2002, BOE announced its advancement into the LCD panel manufacturing industry.
The two firms were the pioneers of China's key components sectors.
The two companies primarily relied on domestic clients initially.
With investments from local governments, the two makers were able to quickly expand their production and business model to help local panel and semiconductor industries reach where they are now.
China's handset industry that began to develop rapidly around 2000 was initially a sector that focused mainly on copycat feature phones.
After going through waves of elimination and innovation, it was able to establish its own ecosystem and competitiveness, forming the foundation of China's dominance in today's smartphone market.
South Korea fell victim to the rise of China.
Its dominance in the steel industry was broken by China in 2003, and its petrochemical industry was also caught up by China's in 2004.
In 2009, South Korea's shipbuilding and car industries both lost out to China.
South Korea's shipbuilding industry faced huge losses and pressure to lay off workers.
With an economy only one eighth of China's, South Korea could barely fight back.
China then surpassed South Korea in the smartphone manufacturing and panel industries.
And now South Korea's memory industry - its last lifeline - may also be in danger due to competition from China.
In 2018, South Korea's semiconductor exports totaled US$108.9 billion and of Samsung's profit of US$52.7 billion in the year, around US$40 billion was contributed by its semiconductor business.
Amid the US-China trade tensions, China is seeking to expand its memory manufacturing and the move will significantly affect Samsung's profitability, which may be halved to only US$20 billion in 2019, according to forecast from South Korea.
We planned a trip to celebrate wedding anniversary No. 21.
Just the two of us.
The husband and me.
Four days, three nights.
Since we made the reservations in January, that meant I had more than three months to prepare.
And by prepare, I mean diet.
And by diet, I mean playing a diabolical mind game that destroys one’s self-esteem.
All to wear a bathing suit I don’t like in front of people I don’t know.
And why?
The people we don’t know lounging at the beach near us don’t care how I look in my suit.
Some don’t care what they themselves look like in bathing suits.
I would kill for the secret to their self-esteem.
I think it’s alcohol.
Leading up to the trip, every Monday would start and end the same way.
Monday morning: “I’m cutting carbs.”
Arrive at office.
Walk by kitchen.
“Cookies.”
Monday night: “I’m not eating anything after 6 p.m.”
Watching the season finale of Vanderpump Rules.
“I can’t stand that idiot Jax. I need something with frosting. I’ll try again next week. What was I thinking starting a diet during sweeps?”
Side note, do you know who is more pathetic than Jax from Vanderpump Rules?
The 45-year-old woman who is invested enough in a ridiculous reality show to know the names of every character.
I don’t even know the names of all my children’s friends.
Two weeks before we left, I made peace with the fact that I wouldn’t be showcasing a perfect six pack while at the beach.
I made peace with that fact after I had my first child, the closest I’d get to that look is with one of those bikini body T-shirt cover-ups with the cartoon drawing.
Usually, I wait until the day we leave to admit defeat, but this madness had to stop.
Every time we go to the beach, I start trying to diet weeks and weeks before.
And every Monday after, I berate myself for not following through.
It doesn’t do me any good.
It doesn’t do anyone any good.
Oh, what I would give to be as fat as I thought I was while in high school and college.
But even then, I wasn’t happy with the way I looked in a bathing suit.
The vacation never turned out any better either.
I look at social media posts from friends enjoying their perfect vacations with their perfect children and perfect bike rides and perfect shots of them reading in a beach chair and think, “How can they read an iPad in the sun? I prefer a book.”
The truth is those photos are often an airbrushed misrepresentation.
Just like the ones I posted when my children were smaller.
I have a series of family photos that capture a smiling, relaxed family.
What those images don’t show is me screaming, “I don’t ask a lot of you people. You will wear those shorts, you will smile, and you will like it,” moments before.
I can’t do that now.
Teenage boys have a way of humbling us that way.
They will call you out on pictures that you’ve just spent 10 minutes using an app to airbrush away imperfections.
So, I ditched the diet, believe it or not, and we had a great time.
My husband and I lounged and walked and talked and explored a new city.
For so long, I had a genuine fear of wearing a bathing suit in public.
This year, I realized that fear was unrealistic.
Kind of like my fear of quicksand as a child.
I always thought it would be a much bigger deal as an adult.
I expected to have one close call.
But no, I’ve never been almost swallowed up by the earth because of quicksand.
It’s just like I won’t get swallowed up by the earth if my hips show a few more dimples or my boobs hang a little bit lower than everyone else’s at the beach.
Who knew all along gravity was the real enemy?
That fear will never leave.
In early April, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) released its border crossing and apprehension numbers for the month of March.
And as The Daily Wire has repeatedly noted, the situation was already so dire that CBP Deputy Commissioner Robert E. Perez referred to the onslaught, at the time of the release of the March numbers, as a "system-wide emergency": "We are currently experiencing a system-wide emergency in our processing and holding facilities.
The humanitarian crisis created by a massive influx of family groups and unaccompanied children in recent months has forced CBP to reallocate resources away from law enforcement, trade and travel missions to process and provide care for those in our custody," said CBP Deputy Commissioner Robert E. Perez.
The impacts to legitimate trade and travel cannot be overstated. As this crisis continues to worsen, it undermines CBP’s ability to perform its dual mission of protecting our borders and facilitating legitimate trade and travel.
We are past the point of being in a full-on crisis at our southern border, as even an increasing number of Democrats and venerable leftist media outlets are willing to concede.
And yet, as The Daily Wire reported yesterday, the brand-new CBP numbers released for the month are even more harrowing.
It is worth breaking down the numbers a little more.
Per CBP's official data release, total border apprehensions between points of entry in April rose 6.62% over March's already-record-shattering pace.
Astoundingly, April's apprehension total of 98,977 is a full 94.04% higher than the monthly total from the beginning of the federal government's fiscal year, in October 2018.
In other words, apprehensions between points of entry along the border have nearly doubled in just the first seven months of the current fiscal year.
As Daniel Horowitz observes, the combined total for points of entry inadmissibles and apprehensions between points of entry is 109,144, which is the highest monthly total since the second term of the George W. Bush administration.
Furthermore, as Horowitz states, "it is very likely the highest number of unique individuals of all time, given that many in the past were the same individuals deported multiple times within the same week, while almost all of these are first-timers."
It is also worth re-emphasizing the social transformation without representation that is currently transpiring with respect to our immigration numbers from Guatemala and Honduras, in particular.
As the Department of Homeland Security has stated, over 1% of the populations of each country have entered the United States since September.
But according to immigration policy expert Horowitz's own math, "the size of these countries’ populations in America equal roughly 6.6% and 9.2% of their respective populations in Guatemala and Honduras."
Those are eye-gouging statistics.
TheBlaze broke down the single adults and family unit tallies: "CBP reported that most of those apprehended in April (58,474 or 59 percent) crossed the border in a family unit. Less than one-third (31,606 or 32 percent) were single adults. In contrast, most of those turned away at the border (6,144 or 60 percent) were single adults."
CBP sounded the alarm yesterday on its official Twitter feed, tweeting, "As of Sunday, only 7 months into the fiscal year, #BorderPatrol has surpassed the TOTAL Southwest border apprehensions of every fiscal year since 2009."
It also tweeted, "#CBP is experiencing an unprecedented and unsustainable situation at the Southwest border. In April, CBP apprehended or deemed inadmissible 109,144 individuals along the SWB." "Unsustainable," indeed.
Hopefully our policymakers are paying attention.
But now she has staked Scotland’s claim to reach zero net carbon emissions by 2045, other changes must follow.
You can’t be half-hearted in an emergency.
As Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said on Wednesday, when burying the SNP’s plan to halve air departure tax (ADT), “concrete actions” must be taken.
“We know that difficult decisions are required,” she said.
Let’s not get carried away, though.
The SNP stumbled into its position on ADT.
It didn’t go looking for it.
A combination of bureaucratic delay and political pressure forced its hand.
It had been ardently defending the policy until a few weeks ago, even though it knew it would generate up to 60,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas a year from extra flights.
The idea of cutting air duty was always a classic piece of corporate capture, a policy based on work commissioned by self-interested airlines themselves.
After some flattery from Easyjet and others, Alex Salmond got on board in 2011 and the idea of halving and then abolishing ADT in Scotland appeared in the 2013 White Paper on independence.
The first cut would costs taxpayers £150m a year in lost revenue, full abolition £300m.
When the UK Government legislated to devolve air duty, and allow Holyrood to cut it locally, Ms Sturgeon kept the expensive wheeze alive in her manifesto.
But then red tape tripped it up.
In 2001, the airports of the Highlands and Islands were granted an exemption from passenger duty to help them survive.
The SNP wants to keep that exemption.
But the EU has changed its state aid rules since 2001, and if the tax is devolved the exemption might fall foul of them and disappear.
So after three rounds of delays, the tax remains at Westminster, where the SNP cannot cut it anyway.
Add to that emphatic opposition to an ADT cut from the Green MSPs the minority SNP needs to pass its budgets, plus Labour tabling a Holyrood vote to ditch the tax cut for Wednesday afternoon, and Ms Sturgeon didn’t really have much choice.
The plan was effectively dead already, climate emergency or not, and she didn’t want to be seen siding with ghastly Tories to defend it.
So she wrapped it in a green shroud and gave it an organic burial.
Once she’d done that, her opponents naturally moved on to the SNP’s support for the new Heathrow runway.
So that joined her list of policies under review.
Note, there is no timescale for the review reporting.
It’s just officials and ministers looking at things through the “new lens of climate change”.
This is a messy process, full of inconsistencies and hypocrisies.
But that’s a small price to pay given what’s at stake.
The SNP didn’t intend to be in this position when it made its manifesto promises or signed its memorandum of understanding with Heathow three years ago, but if its actions help save the planet, I’d recommend forgiveness.
Besides, serendipity and chance have always played a big part in politics.
Sensing when the political weather is shifting and making the most of opportunities are essential arts.
And while business leaders and airport owners are squealing this week, I think the electorate will take a more enlightened view.
In our hearts, we all know the world is getting sicker and worry for our children.
The new stance on the climate has also whetted the edge of a government dulled by 12 years in power.
In defending policies that shorten the future, Ruth Davidson’s Tories look like dinosaurs.
The SNP’s position could secure them the support of generations of young voters, those with the most to lose, as well as foster a sense of national pride that Scotland is trying to blaze a trail.
I have a hunch the SNP might be able to use the story of a county proudly re-inventing itself in another context too.
But it will not be easy.
The SNP are not born-again environmentalists.
They are a staunchly petrochemical party.
They wouldn’t have achieved their position without the extraction and burning of billions of barrels of North Sea oil since the 1970s - or the UK Government’s short-sighted mismanagement of a £300bn windfall.
“It’s Scotland’s Oil,” went the slogan 45 years ago, and it’s still deep in the membership’s psyche.
Both that sense of a wrong that must be righted, and future bounty almost within reach.
Ms Salmond was forever talking about Norway’s oil fund, you may recall.
It now stands at £750bn, thanks to decades of prudent saving, investment and state-owned oil assets.
A Scottish sovereign wealth fund was dangled prominently in the White Paper.
In an interview in 2014, the then First Minister told me Scotland’s natural resources should be developed “to the fullest extent”, ie to the last drop.
When I pointed out the International Energy Agency said we should leave two-thirds of fossil fuels unused to avoid cooking the plant, he said: “Well, the IEA says many interesting things, but I think we should develop.”
That sentiment is not unique in the SNP.
The party’s Growth Commission accepted a Norway-sized piggy bank was now impossible, and recommended a more modest Fund for Future Generations.
But it was still predicated on collecting billions in taxes from pumping North Sea oil and gas that would add to carbon emissions.
The idea was endorsed by the same SNP conference at which Ms Sturgeon declared her climate emergency.
She would find abandoning such a Nationalist shibboleth far, far harder than binning a mortally wounded boondoggle for the air industry.
The SNP has always been supremely pragmatic in pursuit of its founding goal - against EU and Nato membership, then for them; for the euro, then against it.
How it copes with living by principle in the face of a climate emergency will be fascinating.
The moral high ground is a notoriously slippery spot.
Experts predicted Theresa May and her Conservative party would experience an electoral massacre.
Certainly, the results were a stinging rebuff as they lost well over 1,000 council seats.
It was even more dreadful than predicted.
But the Tories were always going to do badly because the last time these seats were fought had been a high water mark for them electorally – David Cameron’s general election victory of spring 2015.
However, Labour is also a big loser in these local elections.
They should have scooped up barrowloads of votes considering we have the weakest Prime Minister in memory – and that news on polling day had been dominated by Tories being convulsed by recriminations over the sacking of Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson.
The fact is that according to the iron rule of British politics, when a government is in trouble, the Opposition is bound to benefit.
Yet Labour was hit by a series of hammer blows.
The party lost control of Bolsover District Council for the first time in more than 40 years.
This is the Derbyshire former mining town that’s been represented in Parliament by the veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner since 1970.
Other key losses were the Wirral and Hartlepool councils – traditional Labour areas.
Overall, they lost more than 75 councillors and control of several local authorities.
Gaining control of Trafford Council, a long-term target, was only a small compensation.
Almost as calamitous for Jeremy Corbyn was the fact that the biggest winners of the night were the Liberal Democrats, who had been written off as a political force with just 11 MPs.
Of course the Tories are still in deep trouble.
But Thursday’s local election results are a brutal reminder that Labour is in no fit state to form a government.
Most pertinently, they expose the huge risk Mr Corbyn took at a meeting of the party’s governing National Executive Committee on Tuesday by not committing Labour to a second EU referendum.
Instead of doing so decisively, and thus pleasing the majority of party members who want a second vote, he sat on the fence, doubtless cynically hoping to appeal to Leave voters and Remainers at the same time.
As so often has been the case with Mr Corbyn’s leadership, his cynicism and procrastination have done him no good.
His attempt to appeal to all sides has left him offending parts of both.
In the Brexit-supporting North East, voters abandoned Labour in droves.
And in pro-Remain areas elsewhere, people who traditionally vote Labour defected to the Lib Dems, the Greens and other fringe candidates.
More worrying for Mr Corbyn, his flawed tactics are set to make matters more difficult for him.
There is no reason to expect Labour will do better in the European elections at the end of this month.
Indeed, anecdotal evidence from canvassers suggests that Mr Corbyn himself is no longer popular.
This may be partly down to Labour’s crisis over anti-Semitism, which could intensify over the next month if the Equality and Human Rights Commission launches a full investigation.
And last week it emerged that Mr Corbyn wrote a favourable introduction to a shockingly anti-Semitic book, written by Left-wing author JA Hobson before the First World War but republished a few years ago.
In addition, while the Tories seem irrevocably split between ultra and soft Brexiteers, Labour is seriously split, too.
But the Tories have a disadvantage.
They cannot agree on who should be Mrs May’s replacement.
By contrast, there is one plausible name on Labour MPs’ lips as a possible replacement for Mr Corbyn: His deputy Tom Watson.
This week, Mr Watson stormed out of a Shadow Cabinet meeting held shortly ahead of the NEC’s decision not to commit the party to back a second referendum.
Mr Watson is a supporter of what he calls a ‘People’s Vote’ and is frustrated with his boss’s refusal to commit to one.
He has also warned that Labour will be beaten by the Brexit Party if it continues to ‘sit on the fence’ and offers only ‘mealy-mouthed’ support for a second referendum.
The 52-year-old Yorkshireman has transformed himself over the last few months.
Two years ago he was a 22-stone political thug with undoubted talents but a shambolic life and was often to be found in a pub.
But he has now lost seven stone in little over a year.
It doesn’t take a super-brain to work out that any politician who loses weight and spruces up their appearance (Boris Johnson is another example, having lost 12lb and with an uncharacteristically neat haircut) is part of their preparation to pitch for the top job.
Meanwhile, a summer of political destruction lies ahead.
Mrs May has promised to be gone within months.
And the local election results mean Mr Corbyn is in deep trouble, too.
In the short term, fresh electoral catastrophe beckons for both main parties.
It’s only three weeks until the European elections – the ones that Mrs May vowed would never happen.
A new menace will appear in the form of Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, which threatens to take away millions more Tory votes.
This takes us to the heart of the nightmare conundrum facing Mrs May and Mr Corbyn.
The Labour leader could agree a Brexit deal with the Prime Minister that would see both their parties fulfil the demands of the 2016 referendum result and take Britain out of the EU within weeks.
But if he does that, he would have thrown the Tories a lifeline and saved them from electoral wipe-out on May 23.
Most disturbingly for our country’s future, this week’s electoral results show that the leaders of the two main parties are stuck in a potential death-trap and neither has any clue how to get out.
A greener city is going to need bigger buildings.
That’s one of the ideas that Vancouver’s city council has just adopted as part of a proposed Climate Emergency Response policy.
And if it seems counterintuitive, it’s actually a crucial insight: That addressing the climate crisis will involve a huge rethink of the way we do architecture and land-use planning.
Vancouver is on the right track here.
City planning staff have developed “big moves” that are meant to support Vancouver’s target of cutting its greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030.
Some of these moves are easy to understand: requiring zero-emissions vehicles, replacing heating systems that run on fossil fuels.
But No. 1 is “walkable neighbourhoods.”
Matt Horne, the city’s climate policy manager, explains that there are two aspects to this: “We want to put housing near amenities,” he says, “ and we need to add amenities where people are living.”
That means touching the third rail of municipal politics: putting new buildings in existing neighbourhoods.
Figuring that out is a challenge of global importance.
Right now, according to city planners, 45 per cent of Vancouver residents live within an easy walk or roll of the things they need daily - jobs, retail and services, schools, parks and community centres.
Planners want to double that to 90 per cent.
The logic is simple: If you can walk to where you need to go, you’ll generate zero pollution.
“The best commute is a short commute, ideally on foot or a bike," Mr. Horne said. Planners estimate that with the “walkable neighbourhoods” tactic, carbon pollution would be brought down by 153,000 tonnes, about a sixth of the city’s desired reduction.
It will also reinforce other policy changes: improvements to sidewalks and cycling infrastructure, and increased transit use.
“There are many other benefits to planning in this way,” Mr. Horne says, “including improved resilience.”
In other words: People are more likely to know their neighbours and to be there to help them in a crisis.
The jargon for this is “social resilience,” and it’s a widely documented and powerful force.
All this is sensible enough, but how do you reshape a city to make it possible?
It means putting more new housing, and jobs and shops and services, in existing neighbourhoods.
In their report to council, staff write that that “will require sensitively introducing more housing choices and essential amenities to neighbourhoods across the city.”
And that is a big challenge.
To be fair, Vancouver is not starting from zero.
Its downtown is synonymous with walkable urbanism and, beyond that, the city has very progressive land-use planning policies.
But this is still North America.
In most of Vancouver, and more so across the region, it’s still convenient to drive.
For now, roughly half of all trips in the city are made by private car.
There has already been discussion here that connects density and sustainability.
Former mayor Sam Sullivan introduced the idea of “EcoDensity” more than a decade ago, and the city, under then-chief planner Brent Toderian, put in place a series of relevant land-use policies in 2007.
Lots where only a single house had been allowed were now allowed to add both a basement suite and a laneway unit.
And yet the topic remains controversial.
Last year’s Making Room plan, an attempt by the outgoing Vision Vancouver administration to push for more multifamily housing, got a mixed reception.
In this city with a housing crisis, the debate is often about what new housing will or won’t do for affordability.
Some locals - especially some older homeowners on the west side - simply won’t get on board with the idea of a denser city.
A recent dustup over a proposed five-storey affordable-rental building in Kitsilano illustrates the point: One neighbour told a local journalist that this modestly scaled building, with polite and elegant design by Metric Architecture, would be “dropping the ghetto in Kitsilano.”
The climate crisis offers a powerful tool to cut through this kind of classist nonsense.
The stakes are high: As the staff report makes clear, Vancouver is already feeling the effects of climate change, “including more severe storms, flooding, and forest-fire smoke. Every degree of warming will increase those impacts and make it increasingly difficult, and eventually impossible, to adapt.”
The city needs to contribute to a solution.
Every city does.
And that means living closer together to each other and to the things we need to get by.
Addressing the climate crisis really is a design problem.
Getty Images Gavin Williamson has been sacked as defence secretary for allegedly disclosing plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build the UK's 5G mobile internet network.
Mr Williamson has strenuously denied he leaked the information from the National Security Council.
Following the dismissal, some MPs have questioned whether the Official Secrets Act has been breached and now want a police investigation.
So how does the law work and what are the penalties?
What is the Official Secrets Act?
The law was first created in 1911 and updated in 1989.
A person can be guilty of an offence if they make a "damaging disclosure of any information or document" relating to security or intelligence of which they are in possession.
The law is strictest for those working for the security and intelligence services, past and present.
Any unauthorised disclosure - under any circumstances - is a criminal offence.
But the rules are different for Crown servants (for example, civil servants, government ministers, the armed forces or police).
In these cases, a person is only guilty of an offence if the leaked information falls into one of the following categories and is deemed "damaging".
Security and intelligence Defence International relations Information which might lead to a crime Foreign confidences Investigations under the Communications Act 1985 and Security Service Act 1989 A person does not have to officially "sign" the Official Secrets Act to be bound by it.
The 1989 Act states that a person can simply be "notified" that it applies to them.
For example, it might be stated in a government employee's contract that the Act applies to them when they start work.
Getty Images Why aren't the police investigating?
Following Mr Williamson's sacking, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, wrote to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, calling for a criminal investigation.
Ms Dick says the Met will "look at any complaint", but adds the force has not received any referral from the Cabinet Office.
The force says it needs a referral and to see material before it can decide whether to carry out an investigation.
Whether or not a disclosure is deemed "damaging" is a decision for the attorney general.
Any prosecution, under the 1989 Act, has to be done with their consent.
If the police do decide to investigate, they would aim to determine the nature of the leaked information and who did it.
But No 10 appears to want to draw a line under it.
A spokesman said it "considers the matter closed".
How often are people prosecuted?
Prosecutions under the Official Secrets Act are very rare - about one a year - according to the House of the Commons Library.
But over the years, there have been some high-profile cases.
In 1983, civil servant Sarah Tisdall gave documents to The Guardian which gave the arrival date of missiles to an RAF base.
She was given a six-month sentence.
In 2007, Scotland Yard civilian police worker Thomas Lund-Lack gave information to a Sunday Times journalist on planned al-Qaeda attacks in Great Britain and the West.
His disclosure resulted in an eight-month sentence.
The maximum penalty for an unauthorised disclosure under the Act is two years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both.
Surveys and pundits keep saying that people dislike evangelicals’ involvement in politics.
Frequently it’s framed as a problem with our witness for Christ.
Onlookers claim that more people would actually come to faith in Him if evangelicals would quit doing so much politicking.
But I’ve got a question: Could someone explain to me just what the problem is here?
Sure, we’ve all got our inconsistencies; we all make mistakes.
But I keep hearing there’s something systemically wrong, right at the heart of what evangelicals hold dear.
And that’s the thing I wonder about.
I’m not saying there isn’t any issue.
I know it’s there, at least in perception; no doubt about that.
But I can’t put my finger on precisely what that problem is.
None of the potential explanations make sense to me, when I look at them closely.
Let me illustrate with four of them.
1. “Christianity should have nothing to do with politics.”
For some Americans, religion is a heavenly matter that has nothing to do with worldly affairs.
Others will accept it as a private practice for home or church, but want it kept it of the public square where it might impact or influence others.
The Bible teaches a religion of public involvement; it’s actually a matter of Christian doctrine.
And in a democracy, that necessarily includes political involvement.
So when people tell Christians we should keep our religion out of our politics, they’re imposing contrary, un-Christian views on us.
So if we follow the Bible’s teachings on this, how does that harm our witness?
2. “Evangelicals can do politics all they want, but why don’t they do ___ instead?”
You can fill in the blank all kinds of ways: “Why don’t put all that energy into caring for the poor?” “Why don’t they fight divorce like they opposed gay marriage?” or “Why don’t they help young mothers as much as they fight against abortion?”
The answer to that is easy: We do.
We don’t do it as publicly as we do our politics, but that only makes sense.
Politics just is a public activity.
These other caring acts are better done one-to-one, or at least on a community level.
3. “We don’t like evangelicals’ moral values.”
But maybe it isn’t our involvement in politics that bugs people.
Maybe it’s the policies we tend to stand for.
We’re convinced unborn children are morally significant human beings, so we oppose abortion.
We tend to favor “traditional” morality in matters of sex, sexuality and marriage.
We’re strong on helping others in need, but we don’t think the government does a good job of it, and we question the morality of doing it through forced taxation.
So we tend not to support wealth redistribution via taxation.
We’re convinced our nation must sustain its economy and its identity if it is to sustain its compassion; therefore we support wise and firm immigration policy.
All of that’s easy to re-phrase in negative terms: “Anti-choice. Homophobic. Uncaring. Racist. Xenophobic.”
From inside evangelicalism, though, it looks a lot different than that.
We make every effort to explain the caring and convictions that motivate our policy choices.
But we keep getting shouted down.
Should we give up, then?
This, too, makes little sense to me.
4. “Evangelicals are hypocrites for supporting Donald Trump.”
But maybe the real problem is our support for Donald Trump.
(Forget for a moment that people were telling us, “Stay out of politics!” before Trump entered the picture.)
Here’s how the line goes: Evangelicals came down hard on Bill Clinton for his sexual misconduct, but we’ll give Donald Trump a pass for his — along with his disrespectful treatment of minorities, the disabled and so on.
So although we may pretend we care about morality, all we really want in a politician is someone who’ll help us to have our way.
But that doesn’t make sense, either.
Granted, we tend to support Trump as president.
I don’t think that’s hard to explain.
We support a lot of his policies, pure and simple — a lot more than we would have Hillary Clinton’s.
Meanwhile I don’t know any evangelical who’s happy with his misconduct.
It’s wrong.
It’s set a bad example for every person he influenced as a businessman, as a TV star, and now as the president.
Unlike Bill Clinton, however, Trump did it before he entered politics, and there’s every reason to believe he has now ceased.
Can’t a person actually think two things about a leader at the same time?
His disrespect toward others as humans?
Bear in mind, I’ve also heard stories of his respecting people, more than most of the public knows.
Still, when he gets it wrong, I cringe, and I call it wrong.
So do the great majority of evangelical leaders.
Again, I have trouble understanding how this harms evangelicals’ witness.
Can’t a person actually think two things about a leader at the same time?
Can’t anyone hear us when we explain (repeatedly!) that this is what’s going on in our view of the president?
Feel Free to Explain It, Please I know my answers here might seem defensive to you.
In reality, no; the truth is, I’m baffled instead.
It’s easy enough to guess why people think there’s a problem with evangelicals and politics, but I have trouble seeing how those answers make sense, once you take a second look at them.
So what am I missing?
Where, exactly, is the problem?
I don’t want Christians doing anything that would stand as a barrier between unbelievers and Jesus Christ.
People say our politics have become that kind of barrier.
That implies we should do something about it.
If you’ll help us define that problem in terms that make sense, maybe we’ll know what we should do about it.
As long as you don’t expect us to give up our convictions, so we can convince others to join in them.
That wouldn’t make sense at all.
You see the phrase ‘political performance’ a lot in this business.
But the truth is, most politicians, even good ones, can’t perform worth a damn.
They’re hams, most of them, by necessity.
In politics, nuance doesn’t sell.
That’s what made what Marie Henein did Wednesday so remarkable.
For more than 30 minutes, she performed in the truest sense.
She put on a piece of political theatre — complete with shrugs, half smiles and quiet asides — that was as understated as it was devastating.
In front of the assembled Ottawa press corps, Henein flayed the prime minister without ever mentioning his name.
She never said the words “SNC-Lavalin,” either even as she linked her client’s case, indelibly, to that festering scandal.
Henein was speaking to reporters Wednesday after the charges against her client, Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, were stayed in a surprise court appearance.
The prosecutor told the court that, after reviewing new evidence, the Crown no longer felt it had a reasonable chance of obtaining a conviction in the case.
The decision was a massive win for Henein and her client.
The politically-charged case against Norman — he was accused of leaking confidential material related to a ship building contract — had come to centre in the public eye, like the SNC affair, around an accusation of political interference in a high-profile prosecution.
The SNC-Lavalin affair has come to define the later part of Trudeau’s tenure in office.
And on Wednesday, Henein kept the focus on Trudeau, and his brand, from the moment she sat down.
“Before we get started,” she began, “I’d just like to introduce the” — at this point she paused for half a beat and allowed herself the slightest smile — “ all female team that represented Vice-Admiral Norman.”
She delivered her next line in a stone-faced deadpan.
“Fortunately Vice-Admiral Norman didn’t fire the females he hired.”
The reference to Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott could not have been clearer if it was stencilled in red paint on a white wall in letters a hundred metres tall.
But Henein was far from finished.
Again and again, she hammered in references to the SNC-Lavalin affair without ever making them direct.
“The decision to stay this prosecution,” she said, “was discretion exercised by prosecutors and the (Director of Public Prosecutions), unimpacted by any political considerations, as it should be.”
She delivered that last line with a staccato flair, underlining each word as a separate sentence.
She slipped in the next one, the most devastating one, as a casual aside.
“That is in fact how things are supposed to work,” she said.
“Politics are supposed to stay out of the prosecutorial process.”
Henein took pains to praise the prosecutors in the Norman case for their integrity and professionalism.
She was not as kind about the Prime Minister’s Office and the Privy Council Office, which she blamed collectively for withholding a host of documents, over months and even years, that she felt were crucial to her client’s defence.
“You should be very concerned when anyone tries to erode the resilience of the justice system or demonstrates a failure to understand why it is so fundamental to the democratic values we hold so dear,” she said.
“There are times you agree with what happens in a court room there are times you don’t. And that’s fine. But what you don’t do is you don’t put your finger and try to weigh in on the scales of justice. That is not what should be happening.”
Henein was 100 per cent clear on one point: the decision to stay the charges against her client, she said, repeatedly, was an independent one made without political interference.
“The prosecutors in a high-profile case looked at the evidence and did what they’re supposed to do,” she said.
“They said we don’t have a reasonable prospect of conviction. The DPP acted independently.”
Fortunately Vice-Admiral Norman didn’t fire the females he hired But she followed that, too, up with a thinly veiled barb about the SNC affair, which centred on alleged political interference into the DPP’s decision on whether or not to offer the SNC Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement.
“If it tells you anything, it should tell you that when she (the DPP) thinks she should prosecute, she goes ahead”—at that Henein paused almost imperceptibly and smiled just for an instant—“ and when she thinks she shouldn’t, she declines to do so. That’s the way it should be.”
The defence allegations once again put the prime minister on the defensive.
“The process involved in a public prosecution like this is entirely independent of my office,” Justin Trudeau said before the weekly Liberal caucus meeting.
“We have confidence in the work done by the director of public prosecutions.”
Henein was later asked if Norman was owed an apology.
He has been through a great deal, she replied.
“There is a ship, a supply ship, that is in operation, on time and under budget, thanks, in part, to Vice-Admiral Norman.”
Here her voice dipped and got a little gravely.
“I think it’s time”—she waited half a beat—”to say sorry to him.
” In Ottawa, a world of Tommy Wiseaus, Henein was Meryl Streep on Tuesday.
And in one inspired performance, she may have done incalculable damage to the already limping Liberal brand.
The Senate is a problem for Democrats.
Well, it’s two problems.
The first is short-term.
The odds that the Democratic Party will win a Senate majority in 2020 are slim.
To get to 50 seats — which is only enough if they win the White House — they need a net gain of three seats.
But while there are 22 Republicans up for re-election next year, only two of them are in Democratic-leaning states, and one of those incumbents — Susan Collins of Maine — is incredibly popular with her constituents.
There are almost-swing states that Democrats could win, but the strongest candidates have either declined to run (Stacey Abrams of Georgia) or set their eyes on the presidency (Beto O’Rourke and Julián Castro of Texas).
And there are states that Democrats hold, like Alabama, that will fall back to Republicans unless everything breaks in the incumbent’s favor.
If, somehow, Democrats win a Senate majority and defeat President Donald Trump, they’ll have to make fundamental changes to the rules of the chamber — like ending the filibuster — if they want their agenda to move forward.
And if they can’t win a majority, Mitch McConnell may cripple a Democratic presidency from the start, blocking judicial and executive branch nominations in an even more extreme replay of his blockade of President Barack Obama’s final Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.
Without the Senate in hand, Democrats could win the immediate fight against Trump in 2020 but lose the larger battle against the Republican Party that supported and enabled him.
The second problem is a set of long-term trends that will benefit the Republican Party as long as it maintains its hold on the least populated states and burden the Democratic Party as long as it represents most of the densest, most diverse and fastest-growing major metropolitan areas in the country.
In 1790, the largest state was Virginia, with 747,610 people, and the smallest was Delaware, with 59,094 people.
Because of the Senate’s equal representation of states, Delawareans had more than 12 times the voting power as Virginians — a large disparity, but not a yawning one.
Today, the largest state is California, with nearly 40 million residents, and the smallest is Wyoming, with just under 600,000 people, a disparity that gives a person in Wyoming 67 times the voting power as one in California.
These population disparities will only get worse.
By 2040, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, half the population will live in eight states, with eight other states representing the next 20% of the population.
The remaining 34 states will hold 30% of the population.
In the Senate, this would give them 68 seats.
Overall, half the population of the country would control a whopping 84 of the 100 seats in the chamber.
As it stands now, the Senate is highly undemocratic and strikingly unrepresentative, with an affluent membership comprised mostly of white men, who are about 30 percent of the population but hold 71 of the seats.
Under current demographic trends, this will get worse, as whites become a plurality of all Americans but remain a majority in most states.
The Republican coalition of rural whites, exurban whites and anti-tax suburbanites may not be large enough to win the national popular vote in a head-to-head matchup with Democrats.
But it covers a much larger part of the country’s landmass, giving it a powerful advantage in the Senate.
And while this coalition — or its Democratic counterpart of liberal whites and the overwhelming majority of nonwhites — isn’t set in stone, it could be years, even decades, before we see meaningful change in the demographic contours of our partisan divides.
Politics is unpredictable and events matter, but it’s also clear that Republicans are on the verge of a durable structural advantage in the Senate that will make Democratic majorities rare outside of the occasional “wave” election.
There are no immediate solutions to this problem.
But progressives — who have the most to lose if the Senate becomes an even larger obstacle to their preferred policies — have started to brainstorm about reforms that might make the Senate more democratic and representative without changing the Constitution itself.
One path involves statehood.
In his book “It’s Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority,” David Faris, a political scientist at Roosevelt University in Chicago, calls for at least eight new states.
The first is Washington, D.C. The second is Puerto Rico, assuming its inhabitants agree to statehood.
And the next six would be formed from America’s superstate, California.
“If the state were more or less evenly divided between left and right, its comparative lack of power in the federal government would be less of an issue,” Faris writes.
“But California is now one of a handful of the most left-leaning states in the entire union, and Californians’ lack of voting power and Senate representation means that the country is pulled inexorably to the right.”
It’s a radical solution, and while it might work, it has one clear downside — Republicans could respond in kind with similar schemes for conservative megastates like Texas and, to a lesser degree, Florida.
And that’s assuming California voters would sign on to the project.
But finding ways to expand the Senate with new members is the right idea, and a recent report from the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, offers an approach that doesn’t rely on extreme forms of constitutional hardball.
To accommodate the demographic trends of the next few decades, the institute calls for expanding the Senate to include other federal units besides states, for the sake of greater democracy and representation: “A modern Senate should reflect a modern federalism encompassing not only states and the federal government but also the district, territories and tribes.”
Under the Roosevelt Institute proposal, Washington, D.C., the Atlantic territories, the Pacific territories and the Native tribes would each receive two senators and a voting member in the House of Representatives.
Individual units could still pursue statehood, but the lack of that recognition wouldn’t preclude representation in Congress.
Today's never-before-seen computing power and technological advancements originally spooked technologists and futurists who preached doom and gloom for the future of the American workforce.
But the Brookings Institution, in a recent report, paints a more nuanced picture of the stresses artificial intelligence will place on society.
And it identifies Dallas Fort Worth as one of the metro areas with a moderately high risk of overall disruption.
Dallas' J.H. Cullum Clark strongly disagrees that artificial intelligence is guaranteed to negatively impact the economy.
With a history degree from Yale and a Ph. D. in economics, Clark leads the George W. Bush Institute's work on domestic economic policy and economic growth.
He acknowledges that history shows the evolution of labor happening now could continue to exacerbate income inequality, and warns employers that they'll need to remain agile in a rapidly changing labor environment.

The Dallas Morning News spoke with Clark about what artificial intelligence could mean for the region's workforce.
This Q&A has been edited for clarity and brevity.
Artificial intelligence may conjure up images of human-looking robots with advanced intelligence.
What does artificial intelligence actually look like in the workforce today?
We're really talking about ever greater computing power.
Computers that can do more and more calculations with more and more complex data, faster.
And then we have this concept that's a little bit hard to define that typically people are including when they speak of artificial intelligence -- the concept of machine learning.
Machine learning is the idea that not only is the computer really, really good at doing lots of calculations in a hurry with a lot of input, but it actually is in some sense good at learning on its own.
You could present a whole lot of unstructured data to the computer without particularly telling it what to do, and it can sort of iteratively do what human beings do when they really learn about a subject.
When it comes to the workplace, you're basically just saying, "can you increasingly substitute computers for what human brains do?"
You're taking tasks that would normally be done by humans and automating them.
In the past, what automation has mostly meant in the world is machines stepping in where human or animal muscle power used to be.
When we think about big assembly lines, robotic arms at an automatic automobile plant, we were talking about things that were backbreaking, literally.
It was about people lifting things, moving them around and attaching them together.
Increasingly, you can harness machines to do all that.
We often see warnings of a dystopian future in which robots take our jobs, but there are benefits to AI and automation as well, correct?
Oh, absolutely.
We're heading toward a world where machines are being substituted not just for muscle power, but for brain power.
So then the question arises: Is it coming for all of our jobs?
That's sort of the question of the hour, isn't it?
Every imaginable new technology since the dawn of time can be a substitute for one or another form of human labor, or it can be a complement to human labor.
If you have more of the technology and more human labor going into the processes those technologies require, then you get good results.
The existence of the technology actually creates new demands for human labor.
It's just not the case that all technological improvement always reduces the demand for human labor.
On the contrary, countless technological improvements have increased the demand for human labor.
And there's no reason to think the future is going to be any different.
Your view of our future job options isn't necessarily dismal then?
No, the idea that AI and computers will, across the whole economy, drastically reduce the demand for human labor is very improbable.
History overwhelmingly, and really without any exception, argues against that.
What actually happens is not that the demand for human labor collapses.
What happens is the demand for human labor in particular activities declines.
We figure out how to produce something with drastically less labor.
Relative to people's incomes, the price of buying that product tends to go down a lot, freeing up spending power to buy a new product.
The demand for new products creates all kinds of new demands for human labor.
You're talking about a shift in the kind of labor humans are needed to perform.
How does that play out in Dallas-Fort Worth?
AI could certainly be good for some and bad for others.
Technological change has generally been good for people who are relatively high skilled and highly educated.
And it's been bad for people who were relatively low skilled, less educated.
That's probably the single biggest driver of rising income inequality in our country.
That's the last 40 years or so.
So how about the next 40?
As AI emerges and plays a larger and larger role in the economy, that's ultimately good news for people who have the skills to be software code writers and people who know how to manage all of the technology within a company.
What may increasingly happen is more and more automation of service industries as opposed to manufacturing industries.
These are typically much more labor intensive than manufacturing is today.
You could very well see the kind of pain that has happened in the rust belt -- places that were very centered around manufacturing.
I tend to think they are most likely net losers from AI.
A more controversial argument, and in some sense a scary one, is that AI could start to seriously impact service industries that depend on lower-skilled or medium-skilled labor.
That's got D-FW written all over it.
D-FW is a place that has a relatively low dependence on manufacturing, but an unusually high dependence on medium-skilled service occupations.
That trend would be worse for Dallas than other places that primarily consist of high-skilled industries, like Silicon Valley or New York City.
That doesn't mean everyone in Dallas-Fort Worth is a loser because of AI.
We'll find that a more AI-enabled workplace makes a whole lot more jobs more valuable, rather than less, because it turns out to be complementary with a lot of jobs.
It isn't obvious that all technological change will be skill-biased and bad for relatively low-skilled workers.
Although you’ve almost certainly heard of Lyme disease, there’s a good chance that you don’t know anyone personally who has been diagnosed with it.
Most doctors are very hesitant to diagnose it, and evidence is pointing to the disease being originally developed as a biological weapon.
The illness, which causes loss of memory, constant pain, crippling fatigue, and possibly psychosis, blindness and paralysis, can sometimes be fatal.
It’s caused by the bacterium known as Borrelia burgdorferi and is usually transmitted to people via the bite of an infected tick.
While many cases can theoretically be treated successfully by a round of antibiotics over the course of a few weeks, it’s often not diagnosed in time for successful treatment.
It can begin with a distinctive bull’s-eye rash, but not everyone will get it, and some people have a different type of rash.
This can make it hard for people to get antibiotics before it has progressed too far.
This is compounded by its remarkable ability to avoid detection in routine tests by altering the outer surface protein of its cells, making many people test negative when they do actually have the disease.
It also mimics a range of other illnesses, leading to no small number of misdiagnoses.
It presents itself in a unique way among various patients, which can even leave patients being dismissed by their doctors as hypochondriacs.
One theory is that Lyme disease originated in the Animal Disease Center on Plum Island, a site that has been linked to biological weapon experiments during the Cold War and a place where Nazi scientists once worked.
100% organic essential oil sets now available for your home and personal care, including Rosemary, Oregano, Eucalyptus, Tea Tree, Clary Sage and more, all 100% organic and laboratory tested for safety.
A multitude of uses, from stress reduction to topical first aid.
See the complete listing here, and help support this news site.
Situated off the coast of Long Island, it was first set up to study foot and mouth disease.
It’s now part of the Department of Homeland Security, and it is shrouded in secrecy.
Plum Island is located just a few miles off of the coast of the rural town of Lyme, Connecticut – the site of the first outbreak of the disease in 1978.
A cluster of adults and children who lived there suddenly started experiencing unusual arthritic symptoms with recurrent attacks of pain and intervening periods without symptoms.
Some had an unusual skin lesion prior to getting the joint symptoms.
Although scientists claim all the island’s animals are killed to prevent the spread of disease, there is nothing stopping birds that fly between the mainland and the island from picking up diseases and spreading them.
One attorney who represents Lyme patients pro bono is baffled by the government’s attitude toward the illness, saying that “it’s weird that no one wants to talk about it, doctors are scared to treat and diagnose it, and the government doesn’t talk about it .”
Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that many doctors are very hesitant to diagnose it, and insurance companies generally won’t cover antibiotics for the illness even though they’re typically covered for many other conditions.
There’s also the fact that post-World War II experiments carried out on Plum Island used ticks as disease vectors for germ warfare.
Although the Plum Island Animal Disease Center claims its facility doesn’t carry out Lyme research, other experiments they’ve denied in the past, like those of Cold War biological warfare, were later proven to have taken place, so it’s hard to take anything they say at face value.
It’s worth noting that people can’t even get into the facility in most cases.
When a small group of reporters asked for access, the New York Times reported that they had to undergo extensive background checks and their visit started and ended with searches by armed guards, who also accompanied them everywhere they went throughout the facility.
The use of electronic devices and photography was prohibited.
Although we can’t say for sure that Lyme originated at the facility, no one would dispute the fact that there are too many unanswered questions surrounding the disease, leaving sufferers confused and frustrated.
With its dubious origins and doctors’ mysterious unwillingness to diagnose it, this has “biological depopulation weapon” written all over it.
DETROIT — A Detroit woman is buying back her neighborhood -- one brick at a time. Meet Nya Marshall. She's investing in the neighborhood she grew up in -- and she's not stopping there.
Marshall bought a building, five blocks from West and Indian Village in Detroit and she plans to open a farm to table restaurant.
Ivy Kitchen and Cocktails will open on East Jefferson this summer.
“My goal is to make sure Detroiters have options for healthy food,” said Marshall.
In fact, Marshall says the restaurant will not even have a freezer because all ingredients will be delivered fresh daily.
It’s an unlikely venture for this female entrepreneur, whose background is in engineering and finance.
Now, she has her builder’s license, too.
“I own this building outright. I paid for it. I developed it. I manage my own construction. I hired every single crew. I did all the work. I did it all!”
Marshall says she’s proud that she didn’t have to take out a loan, and she plans to use the rest of the building as an entrepreneur incubator and café.
“It just says that I can do it, and I want to show others that they can do it as well,” said Marshall, whose new company is called “doing it on my own.”
Gary Neville says he "still can't believe what he's watching", while Jamie Carragher has labelled his former side "extraordinary" after Liverpool kept their title hopes alive at Newcastle.
Liverpool overcame the loss of Mohamed Salah to a heavy knock to the head, beating Newcastle 3-2 thanks to a late goal by Divock Origi to return to the top of the Premier League.
Origi's header from an 86th-minute free-kick glanced off Newcastle defender Jamaal Lascelles on its way into the net as Liverpool earned an eighth straight league win, which puts them two points clear of Manchester City.
Predict 6 correct scores for your chance to win £250K.
All eyes will now turn on Pep Guardiola's side as they host Leicester City, live on Monday Night Football , with Carragher claiming that two "extraordinary" teams are vying for the Premier League title.
What this team are doing is extraordinary.
The problem Liverpool have is that they're alongside another extraordinary team in this title race.
It means it goes to the last day and it means City have to keep providing the answers.
What both teams have done I've never seen before in the English top flight.
It's sad that one team has to finish second, but that's football - you can only have one winner.
The spirit after Wednesday night, a poor result, to come here - a tough place to go no doubt about it against Rafa Benitez's Newcastle - this support were right at it.
This was a difficult game, probably the most difficult game left out of any of Liverpool or City's games, and they've got the three points.
Now, with City players watching tonight - Liverpool will be watching Monday night.
I saw them get panicky against Everton and Manchester United in recent months, and I thought I was seeing that again, if I'm being honest.
They didn't create a chance I can think of after it went to 2-2.
You just felt like it wasn't happening.
With the players going off and those coming on, questions were being asked of Liverpool.
If they miss out on the title, I think people will say that they don't have the bench of City.
People would say that when they make changes, they don't have those players.
But to be fair to the players coming off the bench, at tough times they delivered.
Origi, whether it's his goal or not, Shaqiri puts the delivery in.
Going back to the first part of the season, you had [Daniel] Sturridge's goal at Chelsea to get Liverpool a point.
Origi's goal against Everton - so by hook or by crook, those players at times have got Liverpool over the line.
More and more it's looking like we're going to see two months of flawless results, which each team winning every game until the end.
I can't believe it.
I still can't believe what I'm watching.
Tonight was more like it in terms of what you would historically expect with teams flagging a bit under real pressure.
I think City will win on Monday and I think they'll beat Brighton.
I think Liverpool will beat Wolves, and I've not seen anything that would tell me otherwise.
There was a part in that second-half when you thought, 'here it is'.
'Here's the moment where a team blinks'.
They looked desperate and they looked leggy.
Title race final day live on Sky Sports The last act of The Run In will be shown live on Sky Sports with Manchester City and Liverpool's final matches to be broadcast live on Sunday.
You looked at that front three with Salah going off and Firmino not playing, you think they had Shaqiri from Stoke last season, Sturridge who was on loan at West Brom, and Origi who was at Wolfsburg and you start to think the drop in quality, the big games in Europe, it's all coming on top.
Out of nowhere, they get a goal, and that is a monumental victory as Newcastle had them tonight.
Man City vs Leicester May 6, 2019, 7:00pm Live on That's the best of Liverpool's eight wins in a row.
That is what a title race is; a team is flagging, showing signs of vulnerability, they're losing players, they could have had a man sent off, the crowd is up for it, it's a Saturday night.
Newcastle were at it and it had all the hallmarks of what you've historically seen, like Crystal Palace in 2014, it had everything written all over it.
For Liverpool to come through that, they can be proud.
They weren't at it, they looked dishevelled, the team was all over the place, there was no shape, they were panicking, it was rash, but they got through it.
That's all that matters.
That was as good as it could've gone for Barcelona, who rested 11 players tonight.
It was a leggy Liverpool.
They weren't at it, maybe for obvious reasons, and you have to give Newcastle some great credit.
They sat in when they needed to defend and they were aggressive and put their foot in.
Liverpool made hard work of it.
It was a real slog for them and they got away with it.
Did they deserve to win? I'm not quite sure, but it's game on.
John Murphy returns from a personal hiatus to score PBS and BBC’s adaptation of Victor Hugo’s classic novel.
When you hear the title Les Miserables , you automatically think of the bombastic and overly played Broadway musical that came to a city near you.
Or you saw the film adaptation that won Anne Hathaway her first Oscar a few years back.
Since it debuted over 3 decades ago, Les Miserables has won the hearts of millions around the world.
John Murphy, however, isn’t really a fan.
You’ve heard the music of John Murphy but you may not know it.
I had no idea that he was the man who created that jolting music behind the opening sequence of 28 Weeks Later , and he also composed the lyrical and epic sound to Danny Boyle’s Sunshine (not only an underrated film, but an underrated score).
After taking a personal hiatus to focus on family and his personal life, Murphy wanted to jump back into scoring something completely different.
If you look at his resume (you can sample his music here), there isn’t anything like Les Miserables on it.
This is a classic tale of redemption with a sprawling scope and massive cast, and that wasn’t lost on Muphy.
The score shows a huge amount of range, and he really digs into the minds of the characters.
One moment the minds of Jean Valjean and Javert are amplified by the incessant plinking of simple piano strings and the next we are witnessing the horrors of Fantine literally selling her body for the sake of her child.
It’s a familiar story, for sure, but the execution is sophisticated and smart.
The music is classic and enthralling in a way that a staged musical never could be.
You haven’t done a big project like this in a long time.
Why return from your hiatus with Les Miserables ?
I had enough of the movies, to be honest with you.
I wanted to spend time with my kids.
The spark had gone from me, and I felt that I was going through the motions.
I wanted to feel like a human being again.
When I decided that I was going to come back, I went in to see my agent, and we sat down to figure out what I wanted to do.
I didn’t want to pick up right where I left off—with the wall of the sound, post apocalyptic sort of edgy thing I was getting known for.
I wanted to do something a bit more grown up with more weight.
I wanted something with gravity.
A few days later, my agent said there was interest in my doing Les Miserables .
I just cracked up, because, of course, I was thinking of the musical.
I do think that’s everyone’s immediate thought.
I hate musicals.
I told my agent that I’d be the worst person for that —I’d mess it up.
When he told me it was the book, something clicked.
I remember that I read the book years ago.
I used to tour a lot, and every time I was on the bus, I’d take a big stack of books.
On a tour through France, I read Les Miserables .
I loved it.
I’ve never seen the musical, and I never want to—it’ll ruin it for me.
It’s got everything.
It’s got these dark characters wrestling with demons, good versus evil, death, betrayal.
When I found out that it was going to be a 6 part adaptation and that it was going to be written by Andre Davies—who did the last War & Peace series—I knew I had to do it.
I had a Skype interview with the producers and the director, Tom Shankand.
He was so passionate that I knew he was the real deal.
He wanted to go back into the Victor Hugo book.
It’s like a French Uncle Tom’s Cabin.
Part of what Hugo was trying to do was let the world know of how these people were suffering.
He was a brilliant man.
He was trying to change legislation—he was a real champion of the poor.
Tom wanted to get back to what the story was about and keep it raw.
I was sold.
A week later I was lucky enough to sit in a read through with the actors.
Normally, I get brought onto a movie and they’ve practically finish the cut.
It was interesting because they hadn’t even started filming yet.
Yeah, I got to sit in and listen to their inflections the first time they were reading through it.
There were ideas straight away.
Lily Collins is this tiny thing, so that vulnerability was there immediately.
I got to see Dominic—this huge guy.
It was very inspiring.
When I came onto it, I thought they weren’t going to start shooting for another 2 or 3 weeks, so I thought I’d have 6 months to wait for it.
Then Tom and producers told me they wanted songs written, and I was like…hold on, what do you mean songs.
There are these little songs and piano pieces in Hugo’s novel.
They asked me if I wanted to do it, and I told them that I had never written anything before they started shooting ever.
So I had 3 or 4 weeks writing these things.
With sitting in on that first reading, did it feel like the music could change with the characterizations or maybe that it would even help build the characters?
I’ve never heard of a composer getting to see that so early.
Neither have I!
With these great actors, it was amazing to see them.
With David Oyelowo, you could see the posture he adopted—just reading it aloud.
And I thought to myself, “That’s not natural.”
There were all these different things I was watching—with him especially.
When you’re composing in a medium that you already know about, you’ve got to make the distinction that you’re not scoring the book.
If you're on GitHub, then it's almost certain you're there "on business."
However, those of you also slightly interesting in the social aspect of GitHub might find Git Random fairly entertaining, let's call it that.
Displays a random GitHub user each time your open a new tab in Google Chrome In just a few words, Git Random is a lightweight Google Chrome extension that provides your favorite browser with an atypical new tab screen which displays a random GitHub user, and it's related information.
This means that each time you open a new tab in your computer's Chrome browser, you can view the profile picture, name, location, related websites, email address the first joined date, and all the repositories associated with the user in question, and that's basically about.
Simplistic extension with a straightforward installation and configuration process To start using it, you will need to access its official Chrome Web Store page and then click the "ADD TO CHROME" button.
As expected, the extension also integrates with Chrome's toolbar via a small icon, but there's no extra functionality provided by it, so you might as well hide it, after the following step.
Finally, since the extension relies on the GitHub API (which has an applied rate limit), you should set up an API Token.
Log into your GitHub account, go to Settings, Personal Access Tokens and generate a new token which then can be copied to the special section on your extension's Options section.
Brings random GitHub users a bit closer to you Taking everything into account, Git Random is a non-impressive yet unique Chrome extension that's aimed at users who are also interested in the social aspect of the famous repository and version control platform for building software together.
Dear Coleen I’m worried I’ve made a huge mistake and I don’t know how to make things right.
I’ve always been in love with a wonderful guy, but nothing has ever happened between us.
He’s a real go-getter and is always away for months on end working on exciting projects, but we meet for drinks whenever he comes back home from his travels.
We’re from the same town and went to college together.
The last time he came home, he had a girl with him and he introduced her to our group of friends on a night out as his girlfriend.
He was clearly in love with her, which was like a knife in my heart.
Soon afterwards, they went back to London where he’s currently living.
I felt so angry with myself that I’d never told him how I felt.
I also know his younger brother and we started hanging out a lot more, one thing led to another and we ended up dating.
Fast forward four months and we’re now engaged.
His parents even had a party for us and his older brother came with his girlfriend.
I felt so upset and panicked all night because I really wanted to be with him.
I feel ridiculous that I’ve got into this situation and don’t know why I did it.
My fiance is a great guy, but he’s not the one I want.
Coleen says I think you may have got into this ­relationship with the brother ­unconsciously as some kind of revenge or maybe in the hope of forcing the other brother’s hand to say to you, “Don’t do this, be with me”.
I’ll tell you how you get out of it, just get out of it!
You don’t have to mention his brother, but you can say you feel things have moved too quickly and you don’t think it’s right.
But please don’t go ahead with a wedding – it’s really unfair on your fiance.
Also, think about what it would be like for you – if you did go ahead with the marriage, you’d be forced into family situations with the older brother all the time.
He might go on to marry this girl and have a family, which will only be more agonising.
The fact is, even if you’d told this guy how you felt, I think if he’d felt anything more than friendship for you in return, he probably would have told you and you’d be together.
Because you can’t have him, you’ve gone for “second best” and your fiance will never live up to his brother.
Don’t make the situation any worse than it is – there’s still time to get out of it.
If you love him and respect him as a person, you have to end the relationship now.
At some point in everybody’s life, there comes a moment where you can’t just say you’re going to do something — you have to actually do it.
Now is that moment for Washington Redskins WR Josh Doctson.
After the Redskins declined to pick up a 5th-year option for the former first-round pick ahead of his final year in Washington, the pressure now rests completely on Doctson’s shoulders to perform.
He has had his chances to become the playmaking ball-hawk that the team envisioned when drafting him in 2016.
Time and again — be it due to injuries or other circumstances — he has fallen short of those expectations.
The Redskins are ready to cut ties, and Doctson knows it.
Washington drafted two receivers in the 2019 NFL Draft, highlighted by former Ohio State standout Terry McLaurin, who can be a solid possession receiver as well as a dangerous deep threat.
The Redskins have acknowledged their lack of depth at the receiver position, and they finally took steps to improve it.
The writing is on the wall.
So what would it take for Doctson to secure a second contract with Washington?
The simple answer is production, The former TCU WR has one year left before he hits the free agency market, and if he wants to ensure a check from anybody — let alone the Redskins — he had better get those numbers up.
In his three year career, Doctson has hauled in just 8 touchdowns while averaging a paltry 33 yards per game.
That level of production for any starting receiver in the NFL is lack-luster, and it’s harder to swallow once you consider that Washington has sunk more than $10 million into those three years of mediocrity.
If you ask the team what they expect from Doctson in 2019, you’ll widely get the same answer; a breakout season.
Washington coach Jay Gruden has gone on the record as saying that inconsistent QB play is what has hindered Doctson so far in his career, while pointing out that it could take just one big play to unveil the years worth of suppressed talent.
With Case Keenum at the helm, and Dwayne Haskins in the waiting, the team is going to look better on offense, but they could also run out of excuses for Doctson’s lack of production should nothing change.
When it comes down to it, this is put-up or shut-up time.
The pieces are falling into place for Doctson — he is no longer buried on the depth chart behind Jamison Crowder, and there is finally an average quarterback looking to utilize his potential playmaking ability.
Should nothing change, then it’s time to accept the fact that Doctson could go down as one of the larger busts in franchise history.
It looks as if the team is prepared to come to grips with that realization.
We have somewhere in the region of 70,000 thoughts a day.
70,000...that really is a lot of mental activity!
When you take a moment to absorb that enormous number, it becomes useful to reflect on your relationship to your thoughts.
Do you believe them?
Do you take them seriously?
Do you try to pay attention to them all?!
Thoughts arise naturally in the mind.
Some think of this process as like a sense organ, with the mind producing thoughts in the same way that the eyes produce pictures and the ears produce sound.
All of our senses transmit messages to the brain and we then experience the effects.
What we think affects us deeply, and impacts what else we do and don't notice.
Thinking can also be a deliberate act.
A thought arises, and we then somehow get hold of it and add to it, multiplying it, replicating it, extending it, refuting it, pushing it away...we can be very busy in our minds.
Our cognitive ability is a wonderful gift.
It makes it possible for us to set goals, to plan, to achieve and to be conscious of ourselves and our impact in the world.
Like anything though, it has a shadow side.
Thinking can be enabling, or disabling (or anywhere in between).
For this reason, I believe having perspective on our thinking, noticing its nature and its effects, is very useful.
Perhaps you may experience yourself as the sky through which thoughts pass like clouds?
Or as a mountain that the clouds of thoughts pass over, sometimes raining or producing thunder, and sometimes benignly passing.
Maybe sometimes your mountain basks in glorious sunshine, with a cloudless sky above?
However it is you connect with the sense that you are more than your thinking, that thoughts are temporary, passing phenomenon that come, hang out a while and then pass by.
do take some time to notice the nature of what fills your head.
We all of us could write soap operas using solely the content of our own heads, so can you detach yourself and watch the drama unfold?
He's been in the wars, hasn't he? the receptionist at the Vet's said to the Boss.
He has, the Boss says grumpily.
Do you have pet insurance? "No. I thought he'd be the healthy one. He's been very expensive to run, as a matter of fact."
Now, that's me he's talking about and I'm the one suffering.
It's only money to him but I'm having to put up with pain.
You'd reckon he'd be a bit more sympathetic.
See, I was tearing through the bush down by the river, giving fair chase to a hare and clipped a log as I went over it.
And it must have been a huge log because I can leap high and long, like a kangaroo, as you probably know.
Naturally I kept going - a tough hound like me doesn't let a nasty injury slow him down or anything - but the Boss says I just made it worse.
He had a look at my bleeding claw and toe when we got back to the house and shook his head.
You'll just have to put up with it, General, he says.
Just like that.
And that was last Tuesday, before the rain came.
But the morning walks got a little shorter after that and he was watching me limping while pretending he wasn't really noticing.
By Saturday he was feeling guilty enough to run me in to the Vet.
And about time, if you ask me.
He told the Vet he thought I might have a splinter in my toe but she shaved around it and told him a claw was dislodged and should probably come out, or it could get infected.
He seemed to think she could do it on the spot and she splashed a bit of "local" on it, whatever that is, gave it a few minutes and took some monstrous clippers to it.
Naturally I howled like I was having my throat cut and she said "He'll need to be sedated."
That was obvious, wasn't it?
To me, anyway.
You can't put a noble creature like me through excruciating pain like that.
He's a sook, said the Boss.
A sook!
It wasn't him getting half his leg ripped off.
The Vet and I both looked at the Boss like the unkind brute he really is and he finally nodded.
Half an hour later I'm under it, the claw gets pulled out and I'm all wrapped up, as you can see, with a plastic bag thing so I can go outside and be a real dog.
With a few good drugs to ward off any unnecessary effects.
The Boss drove me home, complaining that it was all the price of a small car.
You'd think he'd be saying soothing things like "It'll all be okay soon" or "You're a fine hound, General, and worth every penny" but he said nothing like that.
So I've been whimpering a lot and hobbling in quite an obvious way so as not to cut him any slack but all he says is "Quit whingeing."
He's not very happy with me at the moment and it shows.
What a dog has to put up with.
Woof!

So, I feel that way a lot.
My kid is an only kid, husband does NOT play other than video games, and while I am not my kid's cruise ship director, at the same time our relationship is important to me.
I have had enough valentines come home and notes written from my kid that say something along the lines of "Mommy loves me when she plays with me," that I know he experiences it as maybe the most high value love.
Also, I ask him to do a lot that he does not really want to do, for me.
Go to the grocery store on the way home from school, and not be grumpy about it.
Eat when and what I decide.
Clean up when I say so, etc.
And he does.
He does it with a smile on his face.
Sometimes he cleans up his toys so quickly that I don't even realize he's done it.
He almost never complains.
So I think - two way street, golden rule.
He is so generous about doing what I ask, let me show him the kind of love that's most important to him by doing what he asks for 30 minutes or so.
It's not much to ask of me, so dig deep and find the love and do it (I tell myself).
That's how I get myself in the spirit, when I'm struggling to do so.
(But I also do respect my own limits).
I'm not saying by the way you have to play all the time, I just mean, when I have decided I want to do it, here's how I get in the spirit.
Ok, so I'll start by saying sorry.
I'm a long time lurker, first time poster and I'm on mobile.
So, I (25)picked up my sister from my mom's tonight with my fiance (28).
I did that because I listened over the phone, (and she also admitted to me that this is what happened) as her bf beat the hell out of her.
My sister (11), lives with them.
I was on the phone with my sister when it happened.
Fiance and I immediately hopped in the car and headed to go get her, while calling a family friend who got there first, as we live an hour away.
We get there and the house is a *hole for lack of a better word.
Dog * everywhere, stuff everywhere, it's been like that for a while, and no one should be living there.
I've been hinting that my sister should come stay with my fiance and I for a while.
So I told my mom that was it, I'm taking my sister.
She didn't fight it, brought us her school stuff and some clothes and we left.
We are currently at my fiance's parent's house because they live closer to my sisters school and she has school in the morning.
School doesn't last out for another like 17 days.
I guess my questions are, legally, what do I do to get custody?
Where do I go and who do I talk to?
Can I legally be in trouble for taking her like this?
Mom didn't fight it?
Please help with any advice.
I'm lost on what to do from here, but I'm bound and determined that she's not going back.
Bellingen Museum has a problem: its collection is large, repetitive and disorganised and its displays are outdated and uninviting.
Luckily the volunteers who run the place also have clear ideas about how to improv it.
In conjunction with Kevin Williams from Arts Mid North Coast, they've developed a strategic pathway, and with the help of Museums & Galleries NSW, they've done a standards review, assessing their operations and policies against best practice.
The reason we wanted to do these two things was that we were at a standstill. The museum was stagnating, Bellinger Valley Historical Society president Susan Lloyd said.
The first step, organising a vermin-proof, temperature-controlled store room with shelving, is already underway.
This will allow them to clear the decks, create new displays and rotate the objects being presented.
They are also in the process of digitising the collection records to an Access database, so they can readily identify what they have and where it is.
And there will need to be a bit of clear out, which in the language of those who collect things is called 'deaccessioning'.
We need to deaccession a lot of stuff, Susan said.
We have lots of repetition because the collection has just been added to without any discernment about what's worth keeping.
For instance, they have 25 old-fashioned irons, mostly the flat-iron type that was heated up on a wood stove.
You do not need 25 irons Susan Lloyd "You do not need 25 irons," Susan said.
She stressed that when an object is found to be surplus to requirements, the museum will try to contact the original donor to see if they'd like it back.
After that, other museums will be offered the opportunity to take it.
And the grand plan they are working towards?
A timeline display that will take people on a circuit around the museum, focusing on the various eras of Bellingen's history.
They'll be seeking professional help and grant funding for this, but in broad terms it will start with Aboriginal times, go through the early settlement period with people like Mary McNally, then look at the historic buildings, such as those by George Moore.
Then there will be a section on the 70s and 80s, when Bellingen changed considerably.
And then we'll probably finish up with all the festivals in the present day, Susan said.
Volunteer Jann Simmonds said one of the first things she noticed when she came to the museum was that Bellingen's history seemed to stop in 1945.
She's been going through scattered files to consolidate information about the Bellinger River.
I'm up to the water wars of the 90s, she said.
Then I'll get onto the floods and bridges.
The history of how the river has been treated is fascinating.
They've tried to mine it , they 've tried to drain it , they 've tried to dredge it. They've thought about diverting it and damming it. It 's really amazing that it still trickles down, Jann said.
Jann also questioned why the museum had nothing documenting the era when Bellingen's status as a conservative rural country town was shaken up by an influx of alternative lifestylers.
Where's the hippies? she wanted to know.
Pamela Whitehead, who moved here as a 26-year-old in 1977, and Disrael Shore,who visited in 1978 and moved here in 2000, are both gathering information about the 1970s and 1980s.
Disrael is focusing on collecting old films and photos, while Pamela is currently pouring over old copies of the Bellingen Courier-Sun , tracing the rise and fall of the community centre in Meeting Place park.
Originally the town's primary school, the vacated building was repurposed by the new settlers as a community centre in 1975, before being controversially demolished by council in 1981.
A Hippie Trail walk conducted by Ross Macleay as part of the Arts MNC holiday program last week unearthed colourful stories about this event, and others, from attendees who had been part of the action.
Advertising for the walk also triggered some enquiries that are somewhat premature.
People are coming in to look at our hippie display but we haven't even done it, Susan said.
It's at planning stages, gathering information.
Photos and films from the 1970s and 1980s are sought, as are more volunteers prepared to make a commitment to researching and writing.
People willing to donate and configure equipment for an audiovisual display would also be a welcome addition to the team of volunteers.
As a mom, I've lived the endless hours of careful nurturing that go into raising a child, which help your kid develop strong self-esteem.
I also know how quickly a few nasty comments can cause all that to crumble.
Bullying is all too common these days — sometimes so bad that it ends in self-harm or worse.
In this scene from Life and Other Inconveniences (available Aug. 6), Emma, mother of 16-year-old Riley, takes charge like a boss when she learns her daughter is being bullied and goes to town like the mama bear she is. I put my arms around her and smoothed her thick red hair, panic kicking up in my chest.
For a minute, I just let her cry, selfishly savoring the fact that my daughter was seeking comfort from her mommy, and I could breathe her in and hold her close.
Then she pulled back and dashed her arm across her eyes.
What happened?
I asked again.
They're just . . . b*tches, Mom. That's it, in a nutshell. "Who?" "Annabeth and Jenna and Mikayla," she said, her eyes welling again.
Those were her three best friends since they were teeny.
Her only three friends, so far as I knew.
Group friend dynamics were so hard — it was heady stuff to belong, and hell when you didn't.
What did they do?
I asked.
She shook her head and used Blue Bunny to wipe away her tears.
Apparently, they all went to a party this weekend. A party I wasn't invited to. And they all . . .
She gave me a look.
They all hooked up with boys from a fraternity at Northwestern! And got drunk. Now it's like I don't even know them anymore. They sat there at lunch today, practically high-fiving each other because they're not virgins anymore. "Are you kidding me?"
Like Riley, Mikayla had started school a year early.
She wasn't even sixteen yet, and in Illinois, the age of consent was seventeen.
If she'd slept with a college boy, he'd be criminally liable for statutory rape . . . and if Mikayla's parents knew what she was up to, they could be charged with child neglect or abuse.
They said they did it. Or they almost did it. I don't know. That's not the point. The point is, they're sluts all of a sudden! "What did you say?" "I said, 'Why would you do that?' and they just looked at me like I was a stupid little kid." "I'd have the boys arrested, drawn and quartered and dragged through the streets."
I would have to call the girls' mothers, of course.
Which wouldn't help Riley, but my God, if my child was being given alcohol and being taken advantage of at frat parties — raped, let's call it what it was — I'd have the boys arrested, drawn and quartered and dragged through the streets.
Then hanged, then disemboweled, then burned.
I don't understand why they're doing this, Riley said.
I took a slow breath.
Sex, you mean? "Everything! I didn't know they wanted to have boyfriends or hookups or whatever! It's like all of a sudden, no one's talking to me, and I'm totally left behind."
She burst into fresh tears.
They're having sex! I mean, they're just too young! And drinking? At a frat party? They were so proud of themselves. Are they idiots? "Yes," I murmured.
Most teenagers are at one point or another. "Last week we were friends. We had so much fun at the coffee shop the manager asked us to quiet down, we were laughing so hard! Today, they just froze me out. Talked about what they were doing this weekend and no one even looked at me, and when I reminded them that they were sleeping over here and we were going to the movies, they just kept talking like I didn't say anything, and I wanted to get up and walk away, but I didn't. I just sat there like an idiot." "Oh, sweetheart," I said, putting my arm around her again.
I'm sorry. That must have felt horrible.
Was she not included because they knew I wouldn't let her go?
Because she wasn't into boys yet, or maybe ever?
Was this somehow my fault?
Her shoulders shook.
I thought we were the same, you know? Like we weren't in a rush to get into all that boy stuff and drinking and drugs. Annabeth was talking about trying E! We belonged to the Clean Edge Club! We founded it! But I guess they all quit and didn't even talk to me about it, and, Mom, I feel like such a loser.
Damn it!
Why did girls have to do that to each other?
The primal, maternal part of me wished I had those girls in front of me so I could slap their smug little faces.
It seemed like no one's adolescence was complete until a friend turned on them or, in this case, the whole group.
You're not a loser, Riley, I said, hugging her tight.
You're the best kid I know. "Said my mother. Sorry, I know you mean it, but that means next to nothing right now."
Ouch.
When your child is little, you are their everything, able to solve just about any problem, make everything okay with a little talk or kiss or snuggle.
Now I was impotent.
The Northwest Territories government is still mulling over what to do with its sinking and abandoned former Northern Frontier Visitors Centre building.
The Yellowknife building, which was built partly on pilings over water in the early 1990s, had been shifting and sinking for years — even before it closed down in 2017.
It is currently in care and maintenance; it's monitored every day, according to the N.W.T.'s Department of Infrastructure.
It's just basically surviving, said Kevin McLeod, an assistant deputy minister of Infrastructure.
He said it's currently OK to enter the building and look around, but not safe enough for public use as it is still shifting and the beams are under stress.
The department estimates it's paying between $10,000 and $15,000 a year to take care of it.
McLeod said the government has been weighing its options since obtaining the "surplus building."
Last spring, it spent $125,000 to stabilize it, and put out a tender in November for architecture companies to re-imagine new uses for the building.
"We're a prisoner of our experience in terms of what we know or what we don't know," said McLeod.
If people give us a better idea, or a different idea, that opens up all kinds of new worlds to us.
About six companies submitted proposals in November and three were chosen for a design competition.
All three went through what McLeod calls "very stringent submission requirements."
A selection board determined the winner this February.
Now we have some great ideas, said McLeod.
The department said it will go back-and-forth with the unnamed winner, exploring its options for next steps.
It cost the government $75,000, split equally among the three companies, for their ideas.
McLeod said the government will use all of them going forward.
Though not giving the specifics of the designs, McLeod said all three companies recognized the current building's location as a central "meeting point" between the legislative assembly, museum, military and RCMP buildings, and the Frame Lake trail.
It's kind of a hub, and that's what we took away as one of the main key points of the competition, said McLeod.
Wayne Guy, principal of Guy Architects in Yellowknife, was unsuccessful in the design competition.
His team designed a revamped visitor centre — "welcome to our home" as its concept.
It included a new amphitheatre outside for concerts holding up to 200 people, a two-storey exhibition of all regions of the territory, a platform built on new foundation overlooking the water, offices on the second floor, and even a bird watching area.
The plan included LED lights illuminating the building, which would change colours to reflect the aurora forecast.
The centre would be similar in size to the old one; his plan would upgrade the existing building, not demolish it.
"It has a lot of historic merits. We didn't want to remove the memory of the existing building. We wanted, in some ways, to pay homage to it."
Guy, a Yellowknifer of 40 years, said he wanted the space to celebrate local art and culture, while showcasing Yellowknife to visitors as "this marvelous place on the planet."
McLeod said his department is still looking for someone to occupy the space.
Under current policies for surplus buildings, he said the offer goes out to government entities first — but so far, no departments or Crown corporations have "made a firm commitment to it ."
He said then the offer will open up to outside groups with interest (who can directly contact the department).
And though McLeod said he doesn't have an expiration date for the site, if the department can't find anyone,it may be time to say goodbye.
"We're doing our due diligence in terms of seeking out folks who have a need for it. And if there's no need for it, we follow our disposal process," said McLeod.
According to Tiffany Haddish, production on the sequel to the successful movie Girls Trip may have hit a wall, Page Six reports.
While co-stars Queen Latifah and Regina Hall have indicated that progress on the hit comedy is smooth, Haddish recently made a comment suggesting the situation was considerably grimmer.
Last week, Haddish was present at the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Night of Comedy, where an audience member asked her about the highly anticipated film.
“I wish there was, I hope there is. I have been petitioning for it. I’ve even written a script for it. Me and the girls punched it up and made it good. They don’t want it. We understood how much money could be made, and they don’t want to pay it. So I doubt it.” “So we’re just going to make our own movie — called Is She on the Trip ? Ooooh.”
The mischievous Haddish then asked the likely wealthy individual who asked the question, “Are you gonna invest in it ?”
Latifah’s update to People magazine last week also highlighted that the movie had no script.
She stressed that all the actors were in for Girls Trip 2 , and they were just waiting for a script to materialize.
The performer said Haddish called her two weeks prior to the interview maintaining that she, Latifah and hall could write a script themselves.
Hall has also reportedly stated that she is looking forward to moving the story forward.
A source close to Universal Studios told Page Six that no script has been presented for a sequel to the movie and there is no film currently in progress.
A representative for Haddish insisted the comedian’s comments were all part of a joke.
She mentioned that Haddish would love to make the movie one day but has not been involved in the writing of any script, so the studio had nothing to pass on.
A studio representative praised the star’s talent and stated that they continue to have a positive and fruitful relationship with the actress.
Universal said they look forward to working with her on upcoming projects.
Meanwhile, Haddish’s star continues to rise, as she recently made the rounds promoting the highly-reviewed animated show Tuca and Bertie, which follows the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live together in the same apartment, Page Six reported.
She provides the voice of Tuca, a toucan and Bertie’s best friend.
Regardless of the outcome of the Girls Trip sequel, Haddish has maintained that she has no intention of halting her string of successful projects.
“We gotta go all the way up to the top. We still halfway up the mountain, there’s a lot left to do,” she said.
A little girl from Pickens County has been given the ability to play … all thanks to a high school robotics team!
Kristi and Mike Hales told Channel 2’s Berndt Petersen that their little daughter brings joy to everyone she meets.
She is the happiest kid around. She brings smiles to everyone. Her community loves her. Her teachers love her. She's precious,” Kristi Hales said. Kessley, 6, was born with cerebral palsy. She is often in a wheelchair, and playtime can be a bit lonely. It's hard.
You want to see her up and running and playing with her friends.
But she doesn't,” her mother said.
The Electric Eagles of Cherokee County aimed to change that.
Etowah High School’s bobotics team went to work on a contraption called a “Power Wheels Wild Thing.”
It’s a two-handed all-terrain vehicle for children.
They modified it for Kessley, who makes best use of her left hand.
In 2-and-a-half weeks we finished it. It was a piece of cake,” team member Andrew Cua said. What we really did was give a little girl the ability to play,” team member Gwendolyn Peppers said.
Kessley can now go off road, places her wheelchair could never take her.
They've given her a gift that as parents we could not give her,” her father, Mike Hales, said. I don't know that her dad and I have ever been able to just sit and watch our kids play together.
That was pretty special,” Kristi Hales said.
Kessley had hip surgery last Monday and is still hurting.
She won’t be able to drive the ATV for at least 12 weeks.
But she loves it.
The robotics team isn’t through with it, either.
Next, they’re installing Bluetooth technology.
This post includes spoilers for Avengers: Endgame.
We’re living in a minefield of movie and TV spoilers, and avoiding them can be fairly exhausting, especially in regards to Avengers: Endgame.
Many fans even felt the extreme secrecy and spoiler-phobia around the Marvel release took away from the actual story.
So how should we interpret the story of a fan who allegedly befriended the man who spoiled Infinity War for him last year—only to spoil Endgame for him?
A post on r/ProRevenge from Jus10Sch details this year-long con, which apparently started with a stranger spoiling Infinity War in the comments on his Instagram post by listing everyone who’d died.
Jus10Sch then befriended the stranger, and for roughly seven months, the two messaged about movies and memes.
Then, in the final stage of revenge, he became the guy who takes photos throughout the entire movie:
Skip forward to about last week.
I bought my Endgame tickets and I was going opening night.
I asked him if he was going opening night and he said no, which was great news.
He said he was going next week (this week).
So I saw Endgame , and while I was in the theater, I took PLENTY of pictures.
I took pictures of Thanos death #1, Captain Marvel, Ronin, Black Widow’s death, Smart Hulk, Fat Thor, 2 Captain America’s, 2 Nebulas, Stan Lee’s cameo, all the snapped coming back, Iron Man’s death, and several other plot points.
When I got out, I almost thought of not doing it.
I don’t like to spoil movies, I think it’s lame, but I reassured myself that this guy deserves it.
So I texted him that I saw it, he asked how it was and I told him it was great, he told me not to spoil it, and I said “Oh, like how you spoiled Infinity War .”
Then he switched moods, he was all like “Hey man, that was a long time ago, we’re friends now,” Stuff like that.
Then, in one glorious action, I sent all the pictures as fast as I could, messaging plot points along with the pictures.
It was all over in like 30 seconds, but he definitely saw it all.
While this story is probably already being adapted into a movie, there were quite a few people who called bullshit.
The poster claimed the “friend” blocked him on Instagram and that he doesn’t want to publish the photos for fear of getting in trouble.
But the Marvel fandom certainly brings out some obsessive and toxic behavior.
Elsewhere, he was called out for posting on r/ProRevenge and not r/pettyrevenge.
But mainly, a lot of people wanted to know why he had so much time to invest in this.
Plus: Months of messaging with someone about memes, and there’s no emotional connection?
What gives?
If you damage your hair badly enough the texture of your hair can change.
You may have to stop using the flat irons and grow it out to get your curls back.
When you're using flat irons you should use a heat protector to help reduce the damage.
stop doing all of that u may have to wait for the new growth to come through which may take a while Let it grow and stop messing about with it.
You broke it.
Make sure you are using a good shampoo and conditioner, some can actually make your hair worse.
And try using products that repair hair like it’s a 10, or infusium.
I don’t think you need to shave it off, but getting a trim may help!
Shave it off, it will grow back as your natural hair You can wait it out and deep condition it once a week braid it with gel or mousse to hide the heat damage and just wait it out pretty much.
I had to do that when i damaged my hair with heat and in time all of the damage was cut off without having to compromise any healthy length and now i wear it curly all the time because im making up for all the years that i didnt have my curls and i work out alot so heat styling doesn't really have a place in my life anymore.
That’s too bad
For those who may not know, May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month!
Lyme disease is one of the fastest growing vector-borne illnesses with an estimated over 300,000 new cases per year, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection typically caused by a tick bite.
It can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, joint pain and more.
Unfortunately, accurate tests for Lyme are lacking and there is no cure.
According to Lymedisease.org, 56% of those with Lyme disease test negative on the tests recommended by the CDC.
This can make it extremely hard for those living with Lyme to find a proper diagnosis and care.
Awareness is key when it comes to preventing Lyme disease, which is why we’re highlighting some ways you can raise Lyme disease awareness in your community — for Lyme Disease Awareness Month and beyond.
Here are five ways you can promote Lyme disease awareness:
1. Wear Your “Lyme” (Lime) Green People in Lyme shirts Fittingly, lime green is the awareness color for Lyme disease.
If you have anything lime green (if not, you can find some really cool shirts here), wear it!
Not only is it a fun and bright color, but it is also a great conversation starter.
Often people will see a lime shirt and say, “that’s an unusual color, is that for anything?”
Use it as an opportunity to talk about Lyme.
2. ‘Paint’ Your Town Green A post shared by Lyme Yarnbombs (@lymeyarnbombs) on Apr 23, 2019 at 10:17am PDT A great way to spread awareness is to “paint” your town green!
This can include putting a green lightbulb in your porch light or putting green ribbons on your mailbox, door or around town (with permission, of course).
3. Share Lyme Literature Woman sharing Lyme Lit via globallymealliance.org There is a lot of Lyme literature out there.
Some Lyme disease groups have downloadable brochures and signs you can print out, or you can make your own!
Keep some with you at all times so you can share them when the moment arises.
You can also go around to local businesses and ask if it would be okay to leave some brochures or flyers for its customers.
4. Schedule a Showing of ‘Under Our Skin’ “Under Our Skin” is an award-winning documentary that follows the lives of multiple people living with Lyme.
This film showcases the challenges of living with Lyme disease as well as the history and controversy that surrounds it.
It provides an eye-opening look into life with Lyme.
You can try and schedule a showing at your local library, recreation center or anywhere you want.
It is also on Amazon Prime Video for free!
5. Join or Create a Fundraiser There are Lyme disease groups all over the world, and many have fundraisers for Lyme Disease Awareness Month.
So if you find a local group, join their fundraiser!
You can also join the virtual fundraiser of the #LymeDiseaseChallenge which consists of taking a bite out of a lime, sharing a picture/video of it and tagging others join in.
If you can’t find a group fundraiser, consider starting one!
You could organize a run, a silent auction, or whatever appeals to you.
Having a fundraiser is a great way to help those living with Lyme and get others involved, too.

Awareness is key, so let’s work together to spread awareness and promote Lyme literacy.
Turns out Drake is just as big a Game of Thrones nerd as the rest of us.
The 32-year-old rapper hilariously gave props to our GoT queen, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams), while accepting his award for Top Billboard 200 Album for Scorpion at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Wednesday.
Thank you, this is amazing. I guess I gotta thank everybody who contributed to this project. It was a really lengthy album, so it's a lot of people to mention, but thank you to everybody who gave me their time, their energy, stayed away from their family and friends while we were trying to complete this, he said.
I always had a dream of doing a double album, and I finally did it, so now I'll never do it again. "And, yeah, thank you to the Billboards, and I need a glass of champagne," Drake continued.
And, hey, shout out to Arya Stark for putting in that work last week!
While Arya's epic takedown of the Night King on Sunday's episode of Game of Thrones had everyone talking, this isn't the first time Drake has expressed his love for the HBO series.
His 2015 song, "You & the 6" calls out the show by name.
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma/ I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma/ I'm Home Alone with it, momma/ I really hate using this tone with you, momma/ I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma, he raps.
A van is parked every night in front of a half-dozen cameras, but they didn't stop thieves recently from stealing parts from it.
Every time it happens, it's frustrating for the owner, who just wants to worry about taking care of children.
The owner of All Star Learning Center says the thieves who keep targeting her day care van are pretty low, and not just because they got underneath it recently to steal the catalytic converter.
It's because she says they're stealing from children.
It's sad and it's depressing, especially when it comes to the children, Sharese Crawl said.
Video from the South Fulton day care shows a couple of men working to strip parts from the van April 20.
Crawl said it's the fourth time she's had to pay to repair damages caused by thieves in two years.
They come in broad daylight, they come evening, night, midmorning, you never know, Crawl said.
Video from 2017 shows thieves hopping inside the same van before Crawl says they it, damaged it， and dumped it.
She said she's paid $4,000 over the years to make sure she can pick up school age children after school.
Every time it's damaged, it's a setback.
We couldnt pick up for a couple of days, no transportation, for the children, which caused inconvenience for the parents, Crawl said.
Crawl hopes the most recent theft can lead to more patrols by South Fulton police along Washington Road before it affects parents again.
You don't want them to be afraid to bring their children to day care, Crawl said.
She's not sure if it's the same people who keep coming back or different people every time.
Barking Crazy, exactly!
Today 07:55 And you can add into the pot, AIM impatience.
A substantial amount of the selling you can guarantee is from people who have been taking out T20's expecting a rise on news and not getting it， investors who buy in expecting that news in a certain time frame and not getting it.
How many piled in ready for CPR news in April then got out when it didn't arrive?
How many have seen better short term opportunities for their cash?
I personally divested £10k's worth when I realised the CPR was going to now be in May and popped it into something I knew could make my cash work.
I will be reinvesting that (only a small % of what I have in here) on Tuesday.
I think it's air to say we have a fantastic opportunity here, of that there's no doubt, but the three things required to make that opportunity real are the Competent Persons Report stating exactly how much oil is there, the plan to exctract it and the licence to ensure we benefit from it.
ALL are needed.
We have the one.
What do the Heels need to do on the field for the football season to be deemed a success?
On Monday, colleague Joe Carpenter and I penned a piece on this here blog talking about what defines success for the Gridiron Heels in the upcoming football season.
We came back to talk about it, because you can fit more words into a podcast than one would want to read in an article.
As the title indicates, the overarching theme of the podcast is how Carolina can ‘win’ the 2019 season on the field.
Discussed: Does Carolina need to qualify for a bowl game to continue its upward trajectory?
Why Chad is a little bit more rosy in his appraisal of the football team coming off the two previous debacles.
Why Joe’s biggest thing is taking back the state of North Carolina— something upon which the host and guest agree wholeheartedly.
If the first four months of the calendar year are any indication, success should not have a limited application moving forward.
As ALWAYS, keep the great comments coming because they are inspiring a lot of our work on the podcast through the dreary summer months.
A great way to leave commentary is to log on to your podcasting app of choice, leave a five-star review, and have it read on-air so it is part of the public record and a potential topic for future pontification.
Thanks for listening, and Go Heels!
A meager 5 hits was all the offense could muster Heading into this series with the Cardinals, it felt like a good litmus test for the Phillies.
They had faced some teams in the NL East that were down right now and it felt good to get out and see how they might fare against some of the other teams in the National League that they might end up fighting for a playoff spot in the next few months.
It did not start off very well.
In a nationally televised game on ESPN, the offense was DOA, only able to muster five singles against the outstanding Miles Mikolas and the rest of the Cardinals’ pitching staff.
As far as highlights, there really weren’t any for the Phillies.
It was another game on the road where they just looked flat and not ready to pla
Post game, though, it was a different story.
All during the game, we saw that Vince Velasquez and JT Realmuto could not get on the same page.
There was a lot of shaking off by Velasquez, something that was brought up during the postgame interviews.
From Jim Salisbury: After the game, Realmuto voiced frustration that Velasquez did not follow his game-calling more.
“It definitely affected the game,” Realmuto said of Velasquez’s frequent shake-offs.
“It’s surprising. I don’t really know, for some reason we couldn’t get on the same page tonight. Obviously, it had an affect on the game. It’s never good when a pitcher and catcher can’t get on the same page. We’ve already discussed it. We talked about it right after the game. So hopefully we fixed it for next time.”
It’s rare to have a catcher come out and talk openly about not being on the same page as the pitcher, but as Realmuto himself said, they (Realmuto and Velasquez) had already discussed it, which probably made him feel a little more comfortable talking to the beat writers about it.
Again, from Salisbury: “It’s a little frustrating, of course,” Realmuto said.
“Vinny has a ton of confidence in his fastball. That’s one of the reasons he’s so successful. It’s a really good pitch. I’m sure he learned tonight that there are certain times where you need to go away from it and use something different. But you can’t hate him for loving his fastball. He’s just got to be a little bit more aware of about when to use it and when not to use it.”
We’ve heard about read about Velasquez and the mental side of the game that he is still working on.
That side was one of the reasons why Realmuto was brought to this team.
The Phillies acquired him not only for his bat and his defense but for his ability to work with a pitching staff and call a game.
Realmuto studies video and goes over the game plan with pitching coach Chris Young and the staff.
It then becomes up to the pitcher to follow that plan Nights like these happen and will happen again this season.
A pitcher feels very comfortable with a pitch and wants to use it, even if the catcher does not want him to use it.
It’s happened countless times in baseball history and will happen countless times again.
However, it would behoove not just Velasquez but the rest of the staff to make sure they have placed their full trust in Realmuto and his game calling prowess.
It can help them as they keep going in this season.
In part one of this interview, Sami Steigmann spoke about his personal experiences as a survivor of the Holocaust, and as someone who felt isolated for many years due in part to the fact that he was an in-betweener of sorts – both the son of Holocaust survivors and a survivor himself who was too young to remember what was done to him.
We also discussed the need for Holocaust education, as well as the long-term fight against bigotry and hatred more broadly.
The following is the rest of my interview with Sami Steigmann.
Speaking about his goals as a motivational speaker, Steigmann said: Number one, all the tragedies in the world – genocide, Holocaust – can be summarized with one word: bullying.
You can bully a person, you can bully a group of people.
In most cases, and even during the Holocaust, there was a lot of silence, people were bystanders, and what I want to do is make sure that young people will not be afraid to become upstanders.
When they see the slightest injustice, they have to do something about it.
There are certain things that young people can do to make this a better world.
Secondly, what I want them to do is I want them to become knowledgeable.
It’s extremely important, you know?
You can change someone’s perspective, but that change must be completed by them.
You’re not going to convince somebody else if you are not knowledgeable in a subject, and what I want them to do once they become knowledgeable, I want them to mentor one person – but not somebody that already has his or her mind made up – you're not going to change them because they talk from emotion.
I want them to mentor someone who has an open mind.
Then, once they mentor the person, I want them to make sure that that person will mentor somebody else.
It will take a long time to diminish the hatred.
Hate will always be there.
The Nazis and ISIS, they are not regular criminals.
They have an ideology and you see what happened in Sri Lanka and other places, in Pittsburgh, when somebody has an ideology, they are willing to die for it, they are willing to murder for it.
That cannot be destroyed by guns.
The only way you can destroy it is through education.
It takes a very long time, but they have to mentor other people and slowly, one by one, that will diminish the hatred that we have in this world.
What happens if we continue on the path that we're on, and people don't mentor and educate others?
I asked.
Steigmann replied that if we fail to learn from history, it will continue cyclically: Well, the best way I can say it is, if people don't learn from history, history will repeat itself.
Take a look at ISIS as an example.
ISIS did not go against Israel, it did not go against the Jews because Israel is a strong country.
Who do they go against?
The Christians.
Take a look what they did to the Christians in Egypt, the Copts.
Take a look what they did in Sri Lanka.
What I'm trying to say in a different way is, all the hatred started with the targeting of the Jews, but it does not end there.
Lastly, I asked if there was anything that he might want our readership to know.
Steigmann then spoke about the oppression of a Chinese minority people: When I was invited to speak on behalf of the Uyghur people in front of the U.N. and also in Washington D.C., I had never heard about them.
I did not know who they were.
They asked me if I would be willing to do it, which obviously I am, but they want to arrange for me to come and speak in front of the Congress, so for me that would be like a double.
I can talk about the history of the Holocaust, about my life, but I can also talk on behalf of the Uyghur people and what's happening in China.
Unfortunately, there is no other country besides the United States that can put pressure, economic pressure, on China to free the Uyghur people that are in "re-education camps," and they're basically like concentration camps.
So, they want to make sure that they are giving up their heritage and they adopt the Chinese culture.
Family members don’t know what’s happening with them, and aren’t able to get in touch with them.
For instance, during World War II, something that maybe you don't know, a lot of the Jews from the former Soviet Union went to Uzbekistan, to Azerbaijan, and there were Muslims, and how come these Muslims were not against the Jews?
Because they were Uyghur people.
When the former Soviet Union dissolved, they gained their independence.
In China, they don't allow them to be free.
So, I have to speak, you know, people like me, like other people, have to speak on their behalf and on behalf of other groups of people.
If you look at it, you know, you don't hear about it in the news, so you don't know anything about it.
There is silence.
Here is another example.
As far as I know – maybe they are more – but to my knowledge, there are only seven states that mandate and teach genocide and Holocaust as part of the curriculum.
Steigmann then turned the tables, and asked me a question: Okay, so obviously you're not Jewish.
The question that I'm having for you is how do you see what's happening today in this world, especially right now what happened in Sri Lanka, in other places, and in Egypt against the Christians?
And how do you feel the world should fight it?
I'm interested from a Christian perspective, and you’re also a journalist.
I answered: I see it much the same way you described
Big Bang Theory co-creator Chuck Lorre considered launching a new, present-day spinoff to succeed the soon-to-depart hit sitcom, but ultimately decided to put quality ahead of commerce.
As reported back in January, CBS entertainment president Kelly Kahl told our sister site Deadline that the network was very much open to expanding the Big Bang universe with a second offshoot (to join prequel series Young Sheldon ).
“The ball is squarely in their court,” Kahl said of Lorre and studio Warner Bros.
“If they want to talk to us about it, we are here to listen.”
Lorre, appearing at Big Bang ‘s wrap party last week, explained to TVLine in the above video interview that a solid spinoff conceit failed to materialize. “Unless there was a creative reason to do it— a wonderfully, wonderfully creative reason to do it— than the only reason [to do it] is economics, and that’s not good enough,” he maintained. “This is hard work. And if you’re going to do it, you gotta love what you’re doing; you’ve gotta be passionate about it. And if you’re just chasing money, that’s not enough.”
The sitcom giant also recounted how, at last Tuesday’s final Big Bang taping, he “kind of lost it” when he banged the clapboard and yelled action on the episode’s final scene. “I almost couldn’t do it ,” he admitted. “My hands were shaking. I didn’t know that [level of emotion] was coming. “The show meant something to us,” Lorre continued, fighting back tears. “Everybody who worked on the show cared about the show; nobody phoned it in. And it’s hard to say goodbye that.”
The Big Bang Theory finale is set to air Thursday, May 16 at 8/7c on CBS.
Christine and the Queens found it “validating” to have her song rejected by Rihanna.
The ‘Titled’ hitmaker has revealed she penned a track about “sending nudes” for the R&B pop superstar after her team got in contact with her management.
And, although she thinks Rihanna was “too fierce” for the “feeble love song”, she is “down with” being rejected if she is “not worthy”.
She told TimeOut London: “My team were like ‘Rihanna is searching for you.’ I was like, ‘What?!’”
Then I wrote something but of course she didn't take it, because I think it was really sad and depressing!
“Actually I love the song but I think it was too weak for her, it's, transparent skin weak, feeble love song. ”
“It was about sending nudes. I liked the song but I think she's too fierce for it.”
“It's okay to be rejected by Rihanna, I'm down with that. It was validating in a way, I was like, ‘Yes, reject me - I'm not worthy!’” Christine also applauded her idol Madonna, who she was spanked on stage by as a fan at one of her gigs and even went on to duet with the ‘Like A Virgin’ in 2016, for being the only female artist who has a “threatening” “godly” presence “but owns it”.
The 30-year-old singer - whose real name is Heloise Letissier - says that it's “rare” to find a woman in the industry who is “smart and badass” and still “powerful” without being “cute”.
On performing with the Queen of Pop, who she was happy “surrendering” to, Christine said: “I didn't even know if Madonna was human or in a godly form. I surrendered to her.”
“When I was on stage with her what I noticed was the charisma. But it's really a dominant thing - you have to submit. Also as a feminist I was fascinated, I was like oh my god she's going to eat us all. We love it. She's actually I think the only woman in this industry that is threatening but owns it and people love it. I think it's quite rare to achieve as a woman because we're often mean to feel sorry for it or be cute - be powerful but cute.”
“And then I watched a lot of documentaries and interviews with her and she's really smart and badass.”
The ‘Saint Claude’ hitmaker also admitted that she feels “depressed” that not much has changed in over 20 years, and that Madonna's 1992 LP ‘Erotica’ would still be deemed “scandalous” now.
She continued: “For example, ‘Erotica’ today would still be scandalous. So it also makes me depressed because I'm like things are not changing. But it was quite ... I don't know I was surrendering to Madonna. It feels good. It feels amazing.”
Game Of Thrones's Sansa Stark just had a shotgun Vegas wedding with Joe Jonas and we aren't entirely sure what's happening- but we love it, almost as much as Diplo, apparently.
Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas just proved that they're not only A-lister couple goals but a couple of legends, or should we say married legends after they had a shotgun wedding in Vegas after the Billboard Music Awards fully equipped with an Elvis impersonator.
So, which celebs were at this shotgun wedding, and when are we going to get more footage from it, god damnit?!
So far, we strangely only seem to have footage from Diplo- who DJ'd at the ceremony and live-streamed the entire thing, whilst dressed as a rhinestone cowboy, fresh off the red carpet, as you do.
This Twitter user summed up the weirdness of the situation pretty perfectly.
They wrote: "Can we please discuss how joe Jonas got married to Sophie turner in Vegas at an Elvis-themed wedding 2 hours after their billboard performance, had Dan & Shay perform Speechless, had Khalid in attendance AND we found out all this through DIPLO live-streaming this ?"
Indeed, other's rumoured to have been in the Elvis chapel were Khalid, the other two J'Bro's, Nick & Kevin, Nick's wife, Priyanka Chopra (who had pretty much the opposite wedding with one of the most lavish ceremonies India had ever seen) and Kevin's spouse- Danielle.
As for any of Sophie's Game Of Thrones co-stars, including BFF Maisie Williams (AKA man of the match of this week's episode), there doesn't seem to be any sign of them being there- mainly as those present came straight from the music award show, so, could there be some awkward conversations to come?
This may be our favourite celeb story of 2019 so far, and 50% of that is down to the fact Diplo was joint party performer and videographer- but seriously, we need to know which others guests were there, so if any guests want to post some Instagram stories we'd really appreciate it!
Clint Capela's sensational first-quarter blocked shot did not immediately start a Rockets run.
Rockets guard Chris Paul fouled Draymond Green 3.2 seconds later.
The Warriors pushed their lead to three.
But that one play was some combination of an indication of Capela's increased energy and effectiveness and the trigger for the Rockets run that would soon follow.
Either way, the Rockets thought of it as much more than one good defensive possession.
It was unbelievable, Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said.
That was one of the better blocks.The wow factor, where you have 20,000 people going crazy for something that is an unbelievable, athletic gesture where they would have dunked on somebody and then you have the crowd, 'oh my gosh.'
Just that alone is a big factor.
There are little mini battles in the game that are always like that.
When you win that and the crowd gets into it, it helps everything.
Capela had gotten off to a good start with six points and six rebounds in the first quarter. He finished with 13 points and 11 rebounds in 35 minutes. I wouldn't say struggled, but Clint wasn't bringing that aggressiveness that we need, that we've seen from him all year long in those first two games," Rockets guard James Harden said. "That play right there was magnified.
We needed it.
The crowd got into it.
We got into it.
It was, "OK, we're here.' That gave us a boost of energy."
I wouldn’t dare say men have it as hard as women do—or even close— but I am also not so naïve to think that men just don’t have a care in the world, never worry about anything, and feel completely confident, every day.
I know that is not the case.
In fact, the closer I’ve gotten to not just my live-in boyfriend but also his male friends who now confide in me, the more I’ve come to learn that men walk around with a lot of fears and insecurities.
And they lack one, er, luxury that women supposedly have: the ability to admit their insecurities.
On top of feeling self-conscious about certain things, men feel like they aren’t even allowed to talk about that because they have to seem cool, collected, and confident all of the time.
If you love a man or just care about one, you should know these are things most men are insecure about.
Being able to afford things When in doubt as to what a man can afford to do/where a man can afford to take you, choose the more affordable spot.
Men never feel like they’re allowed to say, “I can’t afford this place…” But, if you pick the budget spot, and they want to go big, then they’re free to say, “Nah—I want to treat you to this other place.”
Their hairline. Most men dread losing their hair or even having a receding hairline.
It’s very common, and most women don’t even notice or mind, but men are so insecure about it.
So, if you do date or love a hairless man, just be careful what you say.
Most men worry that they don’t last long enough.
Ironically, most men really only can last for roughly five minutes during intercourse, but they all believe that other men are out there lasting a half hour.
They also worry about their penis size and how hard they get during sex.
From my understanding, almost every man in the world wishes he knew how his equipment measured up to other men’s, but doesn’t feel comfortable asking.
Their romantic gestures If your guy does something super sweet for you, don’t photograph it, video tape it, and post it on all your social media platforms.
Most men don’t really want you broadcasting what was meant to be an intimate gesture.
Babying your fur baby. If your man loves your dog or cat, appreciate it —don’t comment on it.
What I mean is, if you love that your man talks to your dog in a baby voice, don’t point out that he does it, or it will all be over.
Their career anxieties Not only do men have anxiety over where their careers are going, but they also have anxiety over having those anxieties.
They feel like they’re supposed to know exactly where things are headed and feel totally confident, all of the time.
Being too thin This is rarely a concern women have, but it is one that men have.
Men don’t want to be called “slender” or “svelte.”
They feel that those are feminine terms and that men should have some bulk on them.
Being too flabby. Of course, if being too thin isn’t your dude’s issue, then he probably worries about being flabby.
Very few men can actually be that perfect combination of toned and muscular and slender but wide in all the right places.
How manly they are or aren’t Is their car masculine enough?
What about the alcohol they drink?
The clothes they wear?
I’m telling you: men secretly make a million little micro decisions about this when simply ordering an appetizer.
Being sensitive/empathetic. Unfortunately, most men are told from a young age that being emotionally open is to be weak.
It’s one of the reasons they take longer to mature than women.
So, if they do open up to you, don’t make a whole thing about it.
Act like it’s perfectly normal.
Lack of sexual experience. We all know by now that men inflate their number and women falsely decrease it.
Translation: most men have been with far fewer sexual partners than they’ll admit.
Add to that, satisfying women in bed is just tricky, so a lot of men are insecure about how they hold up in this department.
Lack of relationship experience. Men can also feel insecure about their overall lack of relationship experience.
It seems that, by age 30, women have had many more serious, long-term relationships than men have.
Their height If a man is shorter than six feet tall, I can promise you he’s a little insecure about it.
Somewhere along the lines, someone made men feel that being 5 foot 10 inches is “short.”
Coming on too strong Men desperately fear coming on too strong or being called “creepy.”
So, on that note, if a man simply tries to say hello to you, don’t tell him he’s being creepy.
Reserve that insult for the actual creeps.
When I started writing this column, I thought I was going to tell you all about movies you should plan on seeing over the summer/next year, (“The Dead Don’t Die,” “Little Women,” “The Last Black Man in San Francisco,” “Midsommar,” among others) but I had a change of heart when I sat down.
I wanted to talk about filmmaking, passion and time.
I started my time as a filmmaker this year, my senior year (yes, I know that seems kind of dumb to a lot of you, but I’m not too worried about how it sounds.) And filming is one of the most fulfilling ways to make art in my life.
I love the whole process, from writing scripts, casting, paperwork, creating shot lists, storyboarding, filming, to post production.
And yes, you read that right, I love the paperwork parts of it— the papers that tell people where to be and when and give directions about behaviors on set.
There is just so much there and so much that someone can do.
And it is all cool.
I don’t even mind being the person holding the boom mic; that’s actually one of the most important jobs on sets.
I love it, and I love every second of it, no matter how long the days are or how tired or cold I am on set.
The ability to forge your own piece of something on a set is amazing, and to get to do it with other people who are just as passionate as you are is undescribable.
And that’s what I want to really talk about.
I started my filmmaking late because I convinced myself that I could be passionate about something that I wasn’t actually passionate about.
And no matter how hard I tried to pretend, it never worked.
But when I got doing something I wanted to do and that I was passionate about, I didn’t have to pretend how I felt about it.
I just got to do it.
So the whole point of this article is to tell you that you’re not too late to do anything.
I wish I had heard someone say that to me in my junior year as I contemplated changing my entire career path and learning how to exist in a new and completely different field.
And I won’t lie to you, it was hard work, like a lot of late nights and worrying.
But being able to do something I love so much made all of it worth it, and it made me closer to being able to do what I wanted.
The piece of unsolicited advice I’m going to give you isn’t necessarily drop everything and become a filmmaker (even though, I’d love to have you on set), it’s that if you don’t care about something and it doesn’t make you feel passionate, maybe you should think about what does.
You are not late to your calling, that’s not how this works— there is no real time table.
But some things take time, and you are worthy of the time that it takes, especially if that time gives you something you care about and love.
So, go for it, whatever it is for you.
Thanks for reading, and check out those movies I mentioned in the first paragraph.
You’ll love them.
And see you around at the movies.
Ryan Reynolds' daughter convinced him to star in the upcoming movie 'Detective Pikachu'.
The 42-year-old actor voices the beloved Pokémon character in the new movie and the film's director Robert Letterman revealed it was his two-year-old daughter Inez who wanted him to take on the role.
Robert told Collider: "We were all in on Ryan. So, what happened was, I did these tests. I took an old clip of Ryan from a different movie and we animated Pikachu to it. "And the second I saw that test it was done.
It was perfect.
We hadn't even reached out to him.
There would be no other version in my mind.
And when he finally said yes" it was a massive sigh of relief! "And then I found out, he finally confessed, he showed that clip to his daughter and she was the one who talked him into it.
So thank you to Ryan's daughter!
Ryan - who also has four-year-old James with wife Blake Lively - stars alongside Suki Waterhouse, Ken Watanabe, Kathryn Newton and Rita Ora in the Pokémon action adventure.
And Robert is delighted that the franchise - which came out in 1996 and is a collective brand for games, toys, films and shows that involve catching imaginary creatures - is popular amongst both new and old fans.
He said: "First of all, we dedicated the movie to the fans. There's the new generation of fans and there's also the older generation. "
And I was surprised myself how much millennials adore this franchise.
The 20 somethings or 30 somethings they grew up with it, they love it.
It's a love letter to fans of Pokémon but also it's also a human story and amazing journey and its funny and Ryan is hilarious and Kathryn is incredible.
And the emotional ride of it and the heart of it I think is appealing to everyone whether they know Pokémon or not.
Detective Pikachu is out now.
A mother was left stunned when her baby's first word turned out to be Alexa.
Annabelle Gates, 11 months, became obsessed with the Amazon device after spending hours watching her three-year-old brother Lucas play with it.
Her parents Catherine and Liam waited for her first word, expecting it to be the usual 'mama' or 'dada'.
But to their bewilderment little Annabelle came out with 'Alexa' instead.
Police officer father Liam Gates, 29, from Blandford Forum, Dorset, said: 'We've been battling for her to say 'mummy' or 'daddy' but she just went in a completely different direction.
'She's the definition of a modern-day baby. We were just in shock. 'We use it with the kids to play nursery rhymes and Baby Shark. 'It sounds more like 'a letter' because she's still learning how to talk.
She can't activate the device but the fact it's her first word is pretty something.
'We're hoping she'll learn another word soon as she just keeps blurting it out. 'Now when we take her out she just belts it out. She's become completely obsessed with the word. 'It's got to the point now that when she wakes up from a sleep or a nap she'll start shouting 'Alexa' from her cot.
It helps us to know she has woken up.
' Annabelle is yet to expand her vocabulary beyond her first word, so she cannot give the Amazon device any demands.
She is not the first baby to become obsessed with the Amazon gadget.
Little Joe Brady's parents noticed their son had become fascinated with their Echo smart speaker, which responds to 'Alexa', and their constant commands to it.
But Lottie Ledger, 21, and Mark Brady 22, of the West Midlands, were stunned when Joe spoke to the Echo just after turning a year old.
Joe couldn't get Alexa to respond every time, but when he did he would break into a fit of excitement.
Lottie said: 'He actually said Alexa before he said mum or dad. It was one of the few things he could get a reaction from. 'Alexa would say, Sorry, I didn't get that', and Joe would laugh and laugh.
'One day he managed it. We thought it was funny at first so we encouraged it. It was weird because it took us ages to work out what he was saying. 'Then he started running towards it, trying to activate it and we realised.'
Alexa was launched in 2014 and is inspired by the voice system in the Star Trek TV series.
The device can play music, set alarms, manage shopping lists and even give you a weather report.
At least 20 million have been sold since its release.
There have been many more examples of babies speaking unconventional first words.
Bruno Bouchet's 13-month-old daughter Juliet's first word sent shivers down his spine - 'murder'.
Mr Bouchet, an executive producer of an Australian breakfast show, was washing his daughter in the bath last year when she muttered the chilling first word.
Last year, McFly's Harry Judd and his wife Izzy shared a clip on Instagram showing their daughter Lola uttering her very first word - 'Pep-pa' after becoming obsessed with the cartoon Peppa Pig.
The Red Sox are down one more starter, with David Price joining Nathan Eovaldion the injured list with a case of tendinitis in his left elbow.
Price will miss his start Tuesday night and one more before he can think about returning.
Like nearly every player who gets hurt, Price indicated his layoff will not be a long one because his injury is not serious.
“It’s bothering me right now so we’re just going to take a little bit of time,” Price said.
“It’s nothing I haven’t dealt with before, and it’s nowhere near anything I’ve had since I’ve been here. This is nothing.”
Price would not say when it began to bother him, only conceding it was bothering him “right now.”
Price’s manager, Alex Cora, was able to reveal the lefty felt discomfort “right after the start in Chicago” Thursday night.
Cora believes if it was September, Price would pitch through the discomfort.
But it is only early May.
“You’ve got to be careful,” Cora said.
“He said he doesn’t feel it’s something that should take a long time, but at the same time, you’ve just got to be careful.
We’re in a part of the schedule where we’ve got a lot of off days.
We can kind of maneuver around it, and whenever he feels right and we feel that he’s fine, we’ll get back to it.
No timetable.
Obviously the goal is for him to get back sooner rather than later, but we’ll be smart about it.
Price said he would not require an MRI of his arm because “I have a very good understanding of my arm, and this is the right move for us right now.”
High School is having events in the day and night on Monday, May 13, spotlighting the academic and art achievements of its students.
Principal Jami Rainey said the school's annual "wax museum" event, where students in the fourth, seventh and eighth grades dress up as historical figures, set up displays and recite information about that character, will be held that day.
That morning, we are doing the wax museum for the kids in the school, Rainey said, noting that will run from 8:30 to 10 a.m., with parents invited to attend.
Then, that night, we are going to do the wax museum again but we are going to add an art show and a STEM Expo with it. We're going to have three different things going at the same time, he said.
Parents will be invited to the evening wax museum as well.
Events that night will run from 6 to 7:30 p.m. "The kids are very excited," Rainey said of the additional events.
They've been telling their parents all about it. It is the first year that we're doing it.
He said it will be great to engage the community as every student will be involved in one way or another.
The art show will be set up in the gym, and the school will work with an Atlanta-based company, he said.
Each grade level took a theme, even pre-K and Head Start, all the way through eighth grade, Rainey said.
Each grade has a themed piece of art that they did on paper. The company frames it and we will display it in the gym with the students' names on their art.
Parents can purchase it for $25 each and businesses and others can purchase replicas of it, he said.
The students will get their artwork back whether the parents purchase it or not, although it would be taken out of the frame if not purchased.
If they purchase it, they get it that night, he said.
If a business wants it or a parent wants to purchase a replica for another family member or others, they can do that, he said.
Rainey said if a frame and a replica are purchased, the parents can take the frame home but the art is taken out temporarily for a replica to be made.
Our of the $25, the school will get $6 for general needs, although Rainey pointed out the technical needs at the school that it could be used for.
He noted he is trying to create a STEM lab next year, as the school wants to become STEM certified at some point.
STEM programs are those that try to develop science and technology skills for students.
STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math.
The third component for the night is actually a STEM Expo.
Middle grades up, on the back hallway, like seventh and eighth grade, they are taking Washington, D.C. and replicated monuments and buildings and the reflective pool (on the Mall), Rainey said.
They are having to build all this but that is the engineering part of it. But they are having to do the math to do the dimensions. They are working with English and history to write about it. You have your grammar in that. So it is cross curricular multiple disciplines.
He said other grade levels are doing similar projects to be set up as part of the STEM Expo.
Generally, fourth through eighth grade, and maybe some of the third grade, will participate in the expo.
Fourth, seventh and eighth will be participating in all three events that night, he said.
Younger grades will have to only deal with the art show, so as to not overwhelm them.
It is a good culmination to the year, especially for the STEM, he said.
We visited some schools last fall that were already STEM certified to see how it works. The thing about STEM certification is documenting what you are already doing really, because we do a lot of STEM stuff.
Rainey also noted that community and business involvement is also involved in certification, and the school is already working toward those partnerships.
“Sisyphean. That’s the word I won with.”
It took a while to get Eve (Sandra Oh) and Villanelle (Jodie Comer) back in the same room, didn’t it?
But here we are.
And it is about time.
Poor Villanelle’s talents are being rather wasted on low-hanging-fruit assassinations (car wash!) and Eve’s looking a little listless herself.
The Ghost is annoyingly un-fun to interrogate (“She kills people for a living! You’d think she worked in accounts!”), but she has heard of Villanelle (“The demon with no face.”) Eve’s … well, a little desperate.
Desperate enough to suggest that the way to crack The Ghost would be to hire Villanelle to do it.
And the way to get Villanelle into the room would be to put a hit out on … Eve.
What could go wrong?
Highlights: The “Psychopathy 101” presentation is pretty stinkin’ funny.
Eve’s outrage that the photo used in the contract to Villanelle is unflattering, ditto.
And Villanelle screaming “When are you going to get over that ?” when Konstantin makes a quip about her having shot him.
Mostly, it’s still the two women’s expertise in one another, the way their obsession with each other destroys their judgment and the bizarre tone of their attraction to one another.
Villanelle’s “arsenic” fakeout is stellar, not just for its edgy comedy but for the startlingly genuine willingness in Eve’s expression as she swallows it, (“Of course it isn’t poison, do you think I am insane?”) and the endlessly weird intimacy between them.
The editing has a terseness to it that is interesting when it does work and confusing when it doesn’t.
It’s clear Eve has mixed feelings about using Villanelle to get information out of The Ghost, but it’s honestly not clear why.
Even knowing what we know about them.
It’s not clear what Villanelle has done to The Ghost to get her to talk and it’s not clear whether it should be clearer.
Villanelle’s appearance in Oxford gets a big reaction out of Nico but it’s not totally clear which of many possible things is specifically provoking him.
Every once in a while your attention is suddenly drawn to the fact that you’re watching something very stylish and kind of thin on story.
But you generally forgive it.
The episode has a stochastic quality that doesn’t necessarily work; it’s a mosaic of little tiny vignettes that often feel unconnected even when they are.
But it was great to finally get Villanelle and Eve in the same room.
A lot of people have liked it.
None of those people are Ryder Lee.
“I haven’t had any desire (to try it ).”
The meatless burger is slated to arrive in Canadian grocery stores just in time for barbeque season.
However, despite it becoming more popular, Lee will keep a close eye on it.
“As far as there being new things in the marketplace that would like to take over what some of beef and other meats are doing, we’re lucky we have as fantastic a product as we do,” said Lee.
The product has gained significant traction in recent burger times, with it being one of the most popular item since debuting on A&W’s menu.
The company behind it, Beyond Meat, is calling the product “the world’s first plant-based burger that looks, cooks, and satisfies like beef without gluten, soy, or GMOs.”
Lee said this is a threat, but not a new one, as Saskatchewan ranchers always have to compete with other products on the market.
However, this, to him, present an important opportunity.
“The world, at large, continues to want to add protein to their menu,” said Lee.
“Filling that demand is something that the whole world is racing to do. We’re a small part of that in Saskatchewan and Canada, so we have to make sure that we’ve got the quality and the story that goes with that quality to capture the high-end consumer.”
Three or four years ago, at a product launch, I was handed a small baggie containing some brown and blue cloth I’d later learn was a team replica AG2R-La Mondiale kit.
I laughed to myself as I opened it.
Team kit?!
Who wears pro team kit?
Only posers and real pros wear team kit.
Two Julys ago, I was standing in a parking lot off the back of the Izoard, poking a text message to my editor back in Boulder, when Romain Bardet stepped around the corner, climbed into the back of a white van, and sunk himself into an inflatable ice bath.
He’d just finished third that day, and his face had been wiped off, but his arms were still covered in dark brown dust.
He put his head back and grimaced, just slightly, and with no helmet or glasses, that grimace seemed, somehow, more real and more human than the ones we see on TV.
I already liked the way he raced and in that moment I became a fan; I’ll admit it.
I’d challenge you not to.
I chucked that AG2R kit in the donate pile at least a year before I saw Romain’s grimace.
I wasn’t always this way.
In my early cycling years, as a teenager, maybe 1999, I had a short-sleeved U.S. Postal Service jersey.
And a long-sleeved one, too.
I went to the Northbrook Velodrome outside Chicago and saw Christian Vande Velde racing in the same kit that I had , and it was completely awesome .
What happened?
I got older.
More aware of what others wore.
More self-conscious.
I got my own team kit, for teams I rode for, and repped it loud and proud and earned the hell out of that 20% discount on thoroughly average eyewear.
Suddenly, pro team kit felt like posing.
I hadn’t earned it, yet .
Ha!
Yet.
The optimism of youth in one word, right there.
I’m not entirely sure why we, the enlightened amateurs of North America and Australia (because, to be clear, everyone in Belgium owns and wears a QuickStep kit, so this is not a worldwide phenomenon), became so opposed to wearing kit that supports our favorite teams, or our favorite riders.
Is it because we feel we haven’t earned it?
Bollocks.
That assumes someone will confuse us for the real thing, and we all know that ain’t happening.
Maybe it’s because, for many years, serious riders were all part of their own clubs.
I mean that literally.
You had your own kit, designed by the club treasurer and almost certainly hideous.
You had your own sponsors to rep at Tuesday Worlds.
Only new riders, or bad riders, Freds, and hubbards, riders who were decidedly not in the club , would end up with bland Nashbar jerseys or, heaven forbid, pro team kit.
They didn’t know better.
They hadn’t yet been let in.
It was another one of those silent signals, part of a complex but unspoken language of dress and position and stem length and stack height that tells others whether you’re in the gang, or out of it.
Club kits are increasingly rare, though.
So are clubs, actually, at least in my part of the world.
Which means that easy differentiator, the gaudy, logoed line between us and them, is erased.
Everyone can buy a black kit with an arm band.
So let’s open our minds further.
Support not just the clothing brands whose designs you appreciate, but the pro teams you cheer for, or once cheered for, loved or hated.
Rock the Mapei blocks, or the Postal Service eagle, or the whirling colors of EF and Canyon-SRAM.
Or the stripes of Sky (those are on sale this week, I’m sure).
Because pro bike racing is awesome.
It’s hard as hell and the guys and gals who do it are worth looking up to.
And I’d rock the heck out of that AG2R kit if I still had it.
A peloton of posers we may be, but really, what’s wrong with that?
It’s been a bewildering couple of months for Bill Barr.
Barr first served as attorney general in the George HW Bush administration.
That was 1991.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had just turned two years old at the time.
That’s how long ago it was.
Then, this February, by process of elimination, Barr became attorney general again.
The Mueller investigation was nearly over when he got the job.
Barr probably didn’t expect to become a major figure in the Russia story.
He had nothing to do with it.
As far as we know, Barr never met with secret agents in Prague.
He never texted Vladimir Putin on his blackberry.
He never managed a Macedonian content farm.
If Barr betrayed his country for a sack or rubles and a case of vodka, nobody has ever proved it.
But it doesn’t matter.
The Russia story cannot die.
CNN, The Washington Post, and the Democratic Party have too much invested in it.
The fact it is been proved a hoax is irrelevant to them.
Bill Barr is a handy way to keep the Russia in the news.
Fresh smelling clothing gets your day off to a beautiful start, doesn’t it?
But sometimes your clothing may not smell as fresh as you’d like.
Closets get musty along with your clothes occasionally picking up normal body odors.
These are the 7 tips you need to keep your clothes always smelling fresh.
1. Launder after One Wear with This Exception It’s a simple tip but an important one.
Launder your clothing often, generally after one wear.
The only exception to this would be your jeans.
Experts recommend that you don’t wash jeans after each wear because it breaks down the denim.
I’ve got to where I wash my jeans after wearing them twice versus once.
You can go a bit longer but of course you want to launder if there’s any odor or visible stains.
2. Launder Soon after Wearing. It’s best if you can launder your clothing soon after wearing it.
This keeps stains and odors from setting in.
Sometimes this is difficult to do, though.
If you can’t make it to the laundromat for a bit, you may want to spray your empty hampers with a small amount of Febreze.
This can help keep odors neutralized until laundry day.
3. Choose Fragrant Laundry Detergent. A fragrant laundry detergent can make all the difference in the world when it comes to making your clothes smell fresh.
Everyone has their favorites but I love Wisk.
There are other things you can do to make your clothing smell fresh while doing laundry too, such as using scented fabric softener sheets or scent boosters such as Downy Unstoppables.
4. Leave Your Robe in the Closet. This’s something I discovered by accident.
I noticed that every time I walked into my closet, I caught the scent of something wonderful.
It took me a bit to figure out the scent was coming from my robe.
Because I would put my robe on immediately after applying my body lotion, it had a lovely fragrance that spread throughout my closet.
Now all of my clothing has the slightest hint of my body lotion fragrance.
5. Have a Signature Fragrance. I’ve always envied girls that find their signature fragrance.
I tend to bounce back and forth between perfumes because I’ve never found one that was exactly right for me.
But if you’re one of those lucky ladies who’s found a fragrance that’s so completely you that it’s became your signature fragrance then hints of it will get into your clothing from consistent wear.
I have a friend who only wears Pleasures and her clothes always have the soft scent of it, even after being laundered.
This is motivation to commit to a fragrance as your signature.
6. Walk through Your Perfume. This is a trick someone taught me.
After applying your fragrance to your pulse points, spritz into the air and walk through it.
I wouldn’t suggest spraying it directly onto your clothing as it can cause a stain.
But a tiny spritz to walk through has always been safe for me.
Even after your fragrance fades from your skin, your clothing will still have it.
7. Open up Your Closet. It’s easy for closets to smell not so fresh, especially in the summer.
Most of us don’t have closets that have a vent for AC to come through.
That can equal some unpleasant closet odors.
This has an easy fix, though.
Just leave your closet door open so it can air out whenever it is convenient for you.
These are some things you can do to keep your clothing always smelling fresh.
People who know they'll lose if you run that comparison will do everything they can to convince you not to run it.
If you internalize this replacability narrative, they've won--you're now stuck in a shitty job forever.
If you rebel against it, even slightly, they'll triple down on it, but crucially, they'll never actually fire you or even place you on leave, because they need your skills.
If your boss says this, and you don't think this LPT applies to you or anyone around you, read on.
My experience has been that people who work for bad companies tend to have negative experiences, and that sours their work and them, so when they leave (or are fired), their current and former coworkers—who are their primary source of referrals—tend to have found other shitty companies to work for.
It's a sort of closed-loop shittiness system.
Meanwhile, the opposite happens, too.
When life circumstances drive someone to leave a company treating them well, even if they land at a bad company next, they only refer the best people from the bad company into their old, good one.
They are acting as filters into Good-land, if you will.
This has the effect of both improving Good-land and making Shit-land even shittier, since it never gets to keep good people.
So, if you want to break out of Shit-land, how do you do it?
Start by making professional friends outside of your immediate sphere.
Attend conferences, for example.
Any employer who won't send employees to conferences is afraid you'll see outside of their Potemkin shittiness village; their refusal is prima facie evidence that they're a shitty employer, so pay your own conference admission if you must.
Once there, be open that you're looking.
You've been told you're worthless and replaceable for so long that you don't realize you're actually very desirable.
Good employers will now offer you opportunities to speak to their company's attendees at the conference: typically senior management and senior ICs.
Take the chance!
Focus not on how your current employer disappoints you.
Instead, talk about the sort of work that you'd love to be doing.
Describe vision and ambition.
Do this three or four times, and I guarantee you have an offer by the end of the conference.
Short-sighted owners build the company that they want to have, and jealously guard against talent walking out the door.
Smart employers build the company that they want to work at and grow talent internally, even if that means the talent will depart some day.
Brilliant employers build the company that people who are smarter than them would work at.
Health officials once again warned consumers about the dangers of washing raw chicken before cooking it, citing the risk of spreading harmful bacteria to utensils or other foods.
In a tweet sent out on April 26, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) linked to a series of steps that can help eliminate the chances of food poisoning while cooking at home.
“Americans eat more chicken every year than any other meat,” the CDC said.
“Chicken can be a nutritious choice, but raw chicken is often contaminated with Campylobacter bacteria and sometimes with Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens bacteria. If you ate undercooked chicken or other foods or beverages contaminated by raw chicken or its juices, you can get a foodborne illness, which is also called food poisoning.”
The agency recommended placing raw chicken in a disposable bag before placing it in the shopping cart or refrigerator, washing hands with soapy water after handling it, using a separate cutting board to handle it, and never placing cooked food or fresh produce on the same surface as uncooked chicken.
Among other tasks, it also suggested using a food thermometer to ensure the chicken is cooked, and in bold the CDC advised against washing raw chicken because “chicken juices can spread in the kitchen and contaminate other foods, utensils and countertops.”
While food poisoning can be an unpleasant experiences for anyone, children under 5, people over 65 and those with weakened immune systems as well as pregnant women are at risk for developing serious illnesses.
It is advised to call a doctor if temperatures reach over 102 degrees, diarrhea lasts more than three days, blood is found in stool, there is prolonged vomiting or if there are any signs of dehydration.
Maybe you are a better man than I, and you never did.
Maybe you stopped with your first long-term girlfriend.
Maybe you stopped when you started hanging out with guys who didn’t.
Or when you got engaged or married.
Or when your daughter was born.
Or, like many rich and powerful men, maybe you still do.
Maybe you even brag about it to other guys.
Maybe you dream of being a CEO, or the president, and you think it’s a prerequisite for the job.
Or, just maybe, you stopped when somebody called you on it.
When the shame and indignity were turned back on you.
When you lost a friend or a job and you had to confront it.
It’s not easy to stop, because that’s what it means to be “a man.”
A man is in charge, he sizes up and selects, he grasps, he takes what he wants, he makes his own way, he arranges things and people for his own pleasure.
“She likes it ,” he insists, projecting his own need for touch and attention onto any desirable female within reach.
“They like it ,” he concludes, basking in the acclaim of the “men” around him who weren’t “man” enough to risk it.
“I like it ,” he decides, safe in a culture where girls and women are objects, products, where boys and men are consumers.
Until one day, I stopped.
The particular day is not important.
It was somewhere toward the end of my teenage years, sometime at college, I guess.
I had a healthy circle of friends, of both genders.
I was growing up.
But now—in these days of powerful men saying “I don’t exactly remember” and “It was a joke” and “It was a long time ago” and “I didn’t do it”—I can’t help feeling, ever so slightly, that I dodged a bullet.
Because I used to do it. Casually. Regularly.
Instinctively…compulsively, you could even say.
Come on, guys, you know what I mean.
Ranking girls by the size of their breasts.
Pulling bra straps.
Positioning yourself in class so that you get a certain view.
Shrewd “man” that I was, I even sold a Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition to another “man” on the school bus.
$2.50, more than two weeks’ allowance, got me a few packs of baseball cards.
But as you get older, as you rise higher, you take greater risks, you grab for more.
One day, in junior high, it was a few minutes before the last bell.
We were in Home Ec, hormones rampaging as we waited to go home, or to basketball practice, or to the bakery.
A group of guys was at the front left corner of the room, lounging in and around the desks.
I was on the fringes, as usual.
She was in front of us, leaning forward, in stonewashed jeans, almost more white than blue, the style of those days.
Tight jeans.
The guys may have been egging each other on, or maybe I just did it.
My hand reached out and squeezed.
She yelped, turned around, looked for the culprit.
The other guys pointed at me, but she didn’t believe them.
It couldn’t have been me , shy and geeky and unpopular as I was.
And so I got away with it.
Just a junior-high stunt, you say.
But when does a “man” stop?
When does he grow out of this?
Looking at our culture, it’s clear that most haven’t.
I may not have touched any more girls like that, but even after high-school graduation, I hadn’t grown up.
We were in a hotel room in Chicago, the long-awaited music trip.
It was a paradise for kids from rural Iowa.
I’m surprised anyone wanted to chaperone, and those who did probably regretted volunteering.
A few of us senior guys, fresh off graduation, were playing cards.
Some girls were watching.
I had become slightly less geeky—I now wore contacts and I’d had a date to prom.
Confidence and adrenaline led to arrogance, and I invited one of the freshman girls to sit on my lap.
I didn’t force her, sure, but I know I asked more than once.
And in that room, with those people watching, with my seniority, why would she risk saying no?
So she agreed.
I knew it was wrong, and I’ve regretted it ever since.
It lasted only a few minutes.
Maybe nobody else really noticed.
Maybe she wasn’t really ashamed and doesn’t actually remember.
Anyhow, soon after that, I stopped.
Which is fortunate, because you can probably be forgiven for minor indiscretions before you turn 18.
But read the headlines, listen in the locker room, look around the bar—it’s pretty obvious that plenty of “men” don’t stop until they’re caught, exposed, shamed.
Men, you remember, I know you do.
It was funny, yes, but only to you.
It was yesterday, or long ago, sure, but it doesn’t go away.
If you don’t anymore, good on you.
Tell some friends your story, and ask them, “When did you stop?”
If you still do, stop.
Please.
Just stop.
This is all undeniably good - no, great - news that's been a long time coming.
As in, it's taken our slow-and-steady recovery a full 10 years to get us to the point where we have undone most of the damage from the Great Recession.
That said, though, there were still a few dark linings to this otherwise silver cloud.
Chief among them was the fact that while businesses said they added a very robust 263,000 jobs last month, households actually told us that 103,000 fewer of them were working then.
These numbers, as you might expect, are usually pretty close to each other, since they're supposed to be measuring the same thing.
(The reason we bother calculating both is we use the first one to give us the official jobs number, and the second to come up with the official unemployment rate).
Anytime there's a big discrepancy between the two, then, it tells us that things probably aren't as rosy as they might appear.
That is particularly bad news when this is the second time this has happened in as many months.
Indeed, the business survey tells us that we added 452,000 jobs in March and April, but the household one says that we lost 304,000 jobs during that time.
So it wouldn't be a surprise, considering that these things have a way of evening out, to find out that the economy was really adding somewhere around 150,000 jobs a month instead of the 200,000 we've been used to for so long.
How is it possible, though, that the recovery might be slowing down when the unemployment rate just fell from 3.8 to 3.6 percent?
Well, that makes more sense once you realize that it only happened for the "bad" reason that fewer people were looking for work rather than that more of them were finding it.
Which, in turn, is why the broader unemployment rate that includes people who have taken a break from looking for work, or can only find part-time jobs and not the full-time ones they want didn't change at all last month.
In fact, it's only down 0.1 percentage points the past eight months combined.
Not to mention that the share of 25-to-54-year-olds who should be in the prime of their working years and are in fact doing so has stagnated a little bit.
It just fell for the second consecutive month, bringing it back to where it was last October.
It's important to emphasize that this doesn't mean the recovery is in any danger of turning into a recession any time soon.
But while things look as good as ever on the surface of the economy, there are a few potential problems lurking below.
Which, when you think about it, is a pretty remarkable thing to be saying at this point of the business cycle.
That's because a lot of economists thought that the recovery would start to slow down on its own once unemployment got down to 4 or 5 percent, simply because there wouldn't be enough new workers to keep it growing as fast - and that trying to keep it going beyond that would only turn into inflation.
The idea that we could have an economy where prices are rising less than 2 percent, unemployment is less than 4 percent, and we're still adding somewhere around 150,000 to 200,000 jobs a month would have seemed like a fantasy.
The question, then, is whether the whole idea that the economy would slow down once unemployment got below a certain point was wrong, or whether that point is just lower than we thought it was.
And the answer is we have no idea.
If you're a glass-half-full kind of person, you might point out that not only is hiring still strong today, but also that wages are still low enough that there's every reason to expect companies to keep adding just as many people tomorrow.
And that whatever concerns there might be right now will turn out to be just another speed bump on the way to 3 percent unemployment in the never-linear process that is economic growth.
If you're a glass-half-empty kind of person, though, you might say that there are already signs that the recovery might be starting to run out of steam, and that unemployment might not be able to get much lower than it already is.
But in either case, the good news is that the Federal Reserve isn't taking the glass away.
It's letting the recovery run its course, and not making any assumptions about how far that might be.
And why would it?
The result of not doing so has already been an economy with unemployment at a half-century low.
Who's to say it couldn't do even better than that?
Cyclone Fani made landfall in Odisha on Friday morning.
The downpour started at midnight and by the morning of 3 May, the cyclone had hit Puri.
Balasore was on alert as well, since the cyclone would hit this area.
We were all prepared for it.
In fact on Thursday, we went to the market and stored vegetables, fruits, milk and water.
We live in a joint family of 16 members, so we didn’t want to take any chance – all essential stuff was bought and hoarded.
Even the trees in my garden were uprooted.
In the night, the electricity supply was interrupted.
We had already charged our mobile phones and power banks, but the mobile network kept dropping time and again.
The howling gusts of wind was pretty strong.
Even though the doors and windows were closed, we could feel the wind speed, as the gusts kept hitting the windows and doors.
Naturally, the sound of the winds scared the kids a lot.
I remember, my first such cyclone experience was with Cyclone Phailin in 2013.
So for Balasore city cyclone Fani wasn’t as severe as Phailin.
Phailin resulted in extreme flooding.
We all had distributed relief materials in the low lying areas around town that were submerged.
Cyclone Fani was fast, strong winds, so the damage has been in terms of trees getting uprooted, power-cut, damaged houses, shattered windows and glass panes, etc.
On Saturday morning, the electricity was restored.
But I think, they are still working on it because it keeps coming and going.
In some areas, there is still no electricity, my maid was complaining about it.
In fact, I was told that many offices have been reopened in parts of Bhubaneswar.
Right now, the weather is good, with no rains and with sun out.
I hope it remains like this today.
I read that the cyclone may have weakened as per IMD reports.
I only pray for the well-being of every one in the path of cyclone.
It’s enough to jolt Macon conservatives from having hissy fits to temper tantrums.
Within days of each other - right here in the heart of the mid-state’s Bible belt – elected officials put forth a couple of contentious propositions that’ll shake the community norms.
Those propositions: decriminalizing marijuana and selling booze in theaters.
The effort to ban alcohol sales in Macon theaters failed when Mayor Robert Reichert broke a four-four tie with his vote against the ban.
Theater operators may now ask for license to sell beer and wine.
The community divisiveness on the issue manifest itself again with the mayor having to break the commission deadlock.
Reasons for rejecting the sales ban varied, but they included a comment that people become obnoxious when drinking.
Is that what’s happening when the commissioners become argumentative and pouty over issues?
Commissioner Valerie Wynn supported the ban because she wants “one little sacred place besides church where we don’t go and drink.”
One of the hot topics was all the commissioners could handle at that meeting.
Commissioner Al Tillman postponed consideration on a proposed ordinance that would decriminalize possession of less than an ounce of marijuana.
Tillman, along with Commissioner Virgil Watkins, introduced the ordinance which would also establish a $75 fine and eliminate jail time for misdemeanor marijuana possession.
The existing law allows fines up to $1,000 and a year in jail.
Since Tillman and Watkins proposed the idea, opponents have been working continuously to defeat it.
Reasons for the objections range from it would be the first step toward legalizing recreational marijuana use to it would fly in the face of religious beliefs.
Tillman originally planned to bring the marijuana proposal up for vote this week.
However, as a politician might say, he wrestled with his conscience and concluded the public needs more time to consider it.
Translated that means he tallied the number of supporters and determined they were outnumbered.
But he’s not finished.
Tillman plans to hold a public hearing on the issue next week.
If it goes as Tillman expects, those favoring weed decriminalization will dwarf the number of opponents.
That would give Tillman more leverage in his efforts to persuade naysaying commissioners that they should support the wishes of the majority.
While Tillman goes about drumming up support, the opponents won’t be sitting around playing checkers.
They’ll busy themselves drumming up opposition.
If both sides succeed in building their numbers, there should be a huge crowd at the Macon-Bibb County Government Center Tuesday when the hearing begins at 5 p.m.
The center is located at 700 Poplar Street.
Regardless of the outcome, local pot usage probably won’t be impacted.
Joe Berlinger, the filmmaker behind Netflix's Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes has taken another step down the infamous serial killer's dark path.
His feature take on the story, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile , on Netflix May 3, centers around the relationship between Bundy and longtime girlfriend Elizabeth Kloepfer, before and after he's arrested and put on trial for his crimes.
Of all the unbelievable moments in the film that are true to life — including Kloepfer's unawareness, Ted's acting as his own lawyer, and how he was caught — perhaps the hardest to comprehend is that Ted Bundy really escaped prison — twice.
It was actually nearly three times.
In June 1976, after being found guilty of kidnapping and assault, Bundy was sentenced to serve one to 15 years in Utah State Prison, ABC reports.
Daily Mirror notes that in October of the same year, he was caught in the prison yard with airline schedules, road maps, and a Social Security card, and moved to solitary.
USA Today reported that, after evidence was found tying Bundy to the Colorado murder of 23 year-old nurse Caryn Campbell, he was extradited and transferred to Aspen to stand trial in 1977.
It was there he had his first successful escape, which the movie shows.
Planned, however, really isn't the word for it.
ABC News reports in a recorded call between Bundy and prison psychologist Dr. Al Carlisle, the escape was more impulse than anything.
Over the months, I had noticed a number of opportunities to just walk right out... I'd thought a great deal about escape, and I don't know if I had the guts to do it, quite frankly, Bundy said.
KinoCheck International on YouTube Allowed to assist in his own defense, Bundy had access to the 2nd floor law library above the Pitkin County Courthouse.
A judge decreed he didn't have to wear shackles, so Bundy was free to walk around.
Per ABC News, it was June 7 when Bundy was able to make a move.
The guard went outside for a smoke, he's reported to have said later.
The windows are open, and the fresh air is blowing through. And the sky was blue, and I said, 'I'm ready to go,' and walked to the window and jumped out. Honest to god, I just got sick and tired of being locked up.
Fleeing into the mountains and breaking into a cabin, Bundy eluded police search for six days.
With no means of further escape and a sprained ankle from the jump, Bundy walked back to Aspen and attempted to steal a car with its keys left in the ignition.
Police became suspicious after seeing the car weaving down the road, and Bundy was soon back in jail, The Coloradoan reports.
His second attempt was more cinematic.
Bundy was moved to a prison in Glenwood Springs, Colorado.
According to Inside Edition , he slowly acquired a hacksaw and detailed map of the jail from other inmates, and had over $500 cash smuggled in by visitors.
610KONA reports that in a 20/20 interview, Bundy's defense attorney John Henry Brown said, “When I visited him in Glenwood, I noticed that he had lost a lot of weight. I’d say he’d lost 20 or 25 pounds. I would think this would’ve come to the attention of the jailers perhaps. Why is he doing this?”
All part of the plan.
According to The Mirror , Bundy used the hacksaw to cut a hole in his ceiling on December 30, 1977, when jail staff was a skeleton crew for the holidays, arranged books and pillows on his bed to look like he was occupying it, and squeezed himself up through the small opening and into a duct crawlspace.
Brian Douglas/Netflix Per Oxygen, the crawlspace led to a connected closet in a jailer's apartment.
Bundy climbed through the apartment and walked out unnoticed.
Because of the holiday and limited staff, Bundy's escape wasn't even noticed until the next day.
By then, according to ABC News, he had taken a flight to Chicago, train to Michigan, drove to Atlanta, and finally took a bus to Florida, where he remained until his re-capture on February 15 the next year, attempting to drive across the state border into Tennessee, though he claimed to police that he was someone else.
When his real identity was discovered, Bundy was indicted.
It's here that Extremely Wicked picks up Kloepfer's point of view again, according to Variety 's review, with Bundy acting as his own attorney in the two 1979 murder trials.
Per ABC News, he was found guilty of murder and associated charges in both trials.
In the years after his sentencing, he confessed to 30 murders, though the real number may be higher.
He was executed on Jan. 4, 1989.
It's the stuff scripts are made of, and it couldn't have been scripted any better for Oakville native Pat Maroon.
It's May 7, Game 7, rally towels with the No. 7 on them, with the drop of the puck between the Blues and Dallas Stars at 7 p.m., a berth in the Western Conference Final on the line.
Nothing to it, right?
Don't tell Maroon that, who took a tough early-season chapter, crumbled it up, pitched it in the trash can and rewrote himself a more fairytale ending.
Maroon's goal at 5 minutes 50 seconds of the second overtime came after the Blues threw the kitchen sink, their living room furniture, patio furniture, kitchen appliances and anything else at the Dallas Stars and Ben Bishop before Maroon ended it in a 2-1 win in Game 7 of the second round on Tuesday at Enterprise Center.
Maroon drove the net and poked a loose puck past St. Louisan Bishop, who was a brick wall making 52 saves but he couldn't get the 53rd after Tyler Bozak won a face-off to Maroon, who pushed the puck to Robert Thomas.
Thomas used Maroon's pick to get past John Klingberg, throw a shot off the near post, off Bishop's back and fall into the blue paint before Maroon was there to poke the loose puck in and end a marathon game as one St. Louisan bested another for the second time in this series.
Bozie won the faceoff, Thomas made a great move around Klingberg, he hit the post, right off the post, squared it and hit Bishop's back and I just saw it come around and I had to get there, it was a loose puck, Maroon said.
Great play. Those guys have been great for us all year and I'm glad I get to be paired with them. They really amped my season. It's been a tough season for me and being in the situation I am right now, I'm really pleased. Just make sure you get the puck in, goddammit.
If I miss that, I'd be on the other side of it, not the hero.
A lot of boos.
What a game.
The team deserves that win, we fought so hard, we're going to continue to fight.
It's not over yet.
That's two series down, now we've got the conference finals coming up, which is going to be another test for us.
It's going to be another battle.
Thomas, who had two assists, said, We run that play a lot, where I walk around.
I saw the d-man was kind of cheating for it and was ready for it, so I was able to make a little cut to the middle, found some space and was able to get the shot off and Patty was able to bang it home.
It was just a great play all around.
With the win, the Blues move to the conference final for the second time in four seasons against the winner of Wednesday's Game 7 between the Colorado Avalanche and San Jose Sharks. A Sharks win means the Blues open on the road in California, likely on Friday. A Colorado win means the series likely opens Saturday at home. But it almost didn't happen on a night where the Blues completely dominated the Stars from start to finish. They had 103 shot attempts to Dallas' 57, and even though Jordan Binnington was called upon to make some key saves throughout the game (29 in all), the Blues were one shot away from adding to 52 years of heartbreak despite fully deserving to be the winning side on this night. We played well pretty much most of the game," Blues defenseman Alex Pietrangelo said. "I feel like we had control.
I mean, at one point, the shots were like 40-15 or something, maybe they had one in the second.
The second has been a bit of an issue, but we found a way tonight to just kind of minimize their opportunities.
We did exactly what we wanted to do.
We had some pretty good chances. Look, first overtime, we thought we had a chance to score a few times. But ice gets choppy, you're running on low energy, you're trying to make the best plays that you can. Those type of games always find ... a puck finds a way to get in. I don't even know what happened on that goal, but you've just got to keep on playing, keep on shooting and hopefully you get a bounce.
Vince Dunn and Mats Zuccarello traded first-period goals, and the Stars outshot the Blues 13-10.
But the second and third periods, if you thought the series-clincher in Game 6 was a dominating effort in which the Blues, who won 3-2, at one point were outshooting the Jets 27-6 through two periods, outshot Dallas 31-4 in the second and third periods.
It was a pretty good effort from the get-go, Blues interim coach Craig Berube said.
We threw everything there and gave it everything we had. They battled, and they stayed in it. Their goalie had a great game, but our guys never quit and stayed with it.
They had no choice, because Bishop, with family and friends in the stands, was the ultimate puck repellant, and the Blues had no answers.
He played a helluva game, Pietrangelo said.
'Bish' played a helluva series. That's a lot of rubber for him, but just found a way.
As expected, Steven Mnuchin ended the day Monday by inviting Congress to conduct oversight of his wrinkly, white ass.
In a five-paragraph letter, Mnuchin informed the House Ways and Means Committee that the Justice Department has discovered this one weird trick to make unwanted congressional document demands disappear.
They haven't actually told him the trick yet -- Bill Barr will whisper those magic words in his ear "as soon as practicable" -- but in the meantime, ummm, Alla Kazam, Alla Kazoo, Fuck You and MAGA, No Tax Returns For You!
In reliance on the advice of the Department of Justice, I have determined that the Committee's request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose, and pursuant to section 6103, the Department [of Treasury] is therefore not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information.
The statute mandates that the IRS shall hand over any tax return upon request, but one time in 1975 the Supreme Court suggested in a footnote that courts might have the right to determine whether a congressional subpoena has a legitimate legislative purpose.
And even though Steven Mnuchin is in no wise a court, and even though this statute has nothing to do with Eastland, and even though section 6103 makes no mention of legitimate legislative purpose, and even though Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal was very careful to supply a legislative rationale for the request for Trump's taxes, Steven Mnuchin is now the final arbiter of what is and what is not a legitimate legislative purpose.
And we are, quite frankly, sick to death of explaining that no, the law does not say that.
No one at the Justice Department actually believes that the Supreme Court is going to agree that Steven Mnuchin's determination of CONGRESS HOW DO IT GO overrides the plain language of the statute.
This argument is transparently bullshit, and everyone knows it.
The only issue now is whether Justice Roberts allows Trump to drag it out past November 2020.
Third verse, same as the first.
So let's talk instead about Sally Yates.
In January 2017, Donald Trump ordered Acting Attorney General Sally Yates to go to court to defend his facially illegal Muslim travel ban, and she refused.
Because the the law is the law, regardless of who sits in the Oval Office, and she wasn't going to stand before a judge and make a patently false legal argument.
Federal prosecutors swear an oath to defend the constitution, not the president.
Our system of justice depends on having lawyers who swear to uphold the rule of law, and mean it.
Sally Yates meant it, and she was willing to get fired rather than betray her oath.
The 500 former federal prosecutors who signed onto that letter excoriating Bill Barr for his handling of the Mueller Report meant it.
Even Jeff Sessions meant it, more or less.
BILL BARR DID NOT MEAN IT.
He took that oath to protect the Constitution with his fingers crossed.
He admitted as much in testimony to the House on April 9 when grilled by Rep. Matt Cartwright about the DOJ's abrupt decision to reverse its position and declare the entire ACA illegal.
Do you think it's likely we are going to prevail?
Barr scoffed at Cartwright's suggestion that the Justice Department was advocating for 10 or 12 million Americans to immediately lose their health insurance.
Barr himself had advocated against changing the DOJ's stance arguing that the entire statute must fall if the individual mandate was declared illegal.
He knows he's taking a facially preposterous legal stance because Trump thinks, for whatever reason, that running against the ACA is a good position for the GOP in 2020.
In Barr's mind, it's just fine for the Justice Department to make political arguments that are facially illegal, because the courts will sort it out in the end.
We're in litigation.
We have to take a position.
I'm just saying that if you think it's such an outrageous position, you have nothing to worry about.
Let the courts do their job.
A lawyer in private practice does "have to take a position."
He has to make the best argument he can for his client -- guilty or innocent, right or wrong.
But a lawyer who has sworn to uphold the Constitution has to make the best argument under the law.
And the fact that the sitting attorney general admits before Congress that his department makes arguments based purely on politics is a BIG FUCKING DEAL.
But back to Mnuchin.
Let's make an educated guess as to why he came to Congress with this flimsy-ass letter telling them to piss off for legal reasons TBD.
We already know what the legal argument will be -- we've seen Trump's lawyers spamming the IRS with their Eastland footnote nonsense.
The problem is getting a lawyer who actually cares about the rule of law, not to mention her reputation, to put her name on it.
When Sessions withdrew Justice Department support for the individual mandate in 2018, one career DOJ lawyer resigned and two withdrew from the case.
Last month when Barr switched the DOJ's position to REPEAL AND GO FUCK YOURSELF, not one single career Justice official was willing to sign onto it.
And when the DOJ does finally barf up some nonsense to justify withholding Trump's tax return from Congress, we're betting there won't be any career employees willing to back it up.
Because making a farcical legal argument as a blatant tool to delay legitimate congressional oversight violates the prosecutor's oath of office.
In fact, it slips perilously close to obstruction of Congress.
If the DOJ had lawyers willing to put their reputations on the line to do it, they'd have already done it.
For now it's just Mnuchin and Barr, the two cheapest whores in DC.
And they'll do anything.
$1.67 million has been spent on FieldTurf for Newtown & Shakerag Park fields.
This has been the most tangible and widely used items spent with Park Bond monies.
It could have come general fund.
Enhancements to existing parks were also done.
Such as a gravel parking lot and smokehouse at Autrey Mill.
Those were fairly minor costs.
The remainder of the costs have gone to consultants, fees and issuance costs.
Significant interest is being paid each year on the loan.
This really begs the question: why borrow all that money, if they weren’t ready to spend it?
Other proposed features for Autrey Mill seem highly unlikely to be implemented according to the City Manager.
Even though consultants and surveys recommended them.
Such as archery range.
A rope course, and a special needs adventure playground for kids and adults were also in the promoted renderings.
Nothing has been mentioned about it.
Finally, to date (5/1/19), of the $40 million borrowed, ~$13 million has been spent, and $10 million allocated for Cauley Creek Park.
This leaves approximately $17 million for 3 pocket parks and Linear Park.
In conclusion, not a single construction document for a park has been executed since the Park Bond was approved.
Mainly because the costs were grossly underestimated for the referendum.
Like most people, I have varied musical tastes.
That would be fine if I wasn't compelled to start a band based on every genre of music I like.
I have a punk band, an indie-dance band with seven members, a tributes bands for both David Bowie and Prince and there's always the random one-off band I put together for a special occasion.
The point is, I have too many bands and too much gear.
One of them is a dance band with only two members so it requires a lot of synths and drum machines to create a dense audio experience.
Which is great until I realized, unlike playing guitar, I really can't sing while playing a keyboard, never mind two to three digital pianos.
Throw in my insane travel schedule and an upcoming gig where we're playing entirely new songs, and I decided to splurge on the Arturia KeyStep MIDI controller to tackle all my ills.
MIDI controllers typically don't create their own sounds.
Instead, they're used to control other instruments.
With just one keyboard you can trigger notes and beats from multiple devices.
Trying to sing while tasked with two synths and a drum machine is tough work.
But with a controller, I can trigger sequences and play multiple instruments much more easily.
Arturia Keystep The 32-slimkey KeyStep is a solid piece of hardware that has the usual MIDI in and out, CV outputs for older modular devices, Sync in and out for drum machines and USB for your favorite DAW (digital audio workstation).
For those reasons alone, it fit perfectly into my setup, but the reason I dropped $130 (MSRP of $150) on it a week before a show is Arturia's dead simple sequencer.
Often, instrument manufacturers love to ship keyboards with instructions printed on a single sheet of paper with the barest amount of information about their device.
It's always a fun game trying to find out how to actually use the sequencer on any of these instruments and even then, the procedure can be frustrating.
Worst, if things go wrong on stage, you can't exactly open up an owner's manual and fix it.
The KeyStep, on the other hand, has the easiest-to-program sequencer (a feature that places notes and beats in order to create an entire -- or portion -- of a song) out there.
If you need rests between notes, you can add that in as you play.
Press Stop when you're done and then Play to hear what you've recorded.
That's it.
No submenus, no weird need to press multiple buttons at once to make things work, it's just dead simple.
Plus, you can easily amend those sequences on the fly which is outstanding when you're playing live.
I could build upon what I had in real time without worrying if I was correctly following the elaborate procedure needed on my other synths to accomplish the same thing.
I would never recommend adding a new piece of equipment to your setup a week before a show.
But within a few hours of using it, I knew that placing the KeyStep into the mix was going to make our show better without having to delve into a dense user's manual.
I don't want to be looking down while playing a show, I want to interact with the audience and the KeyStep allows that.
Now if I could only figure out a way to work into my outlaw country band.
