It is not the EU dream team this newspaper had hoped for, but the European Council has nominated a solid crew to steer the bloc into the next decade.
Its choice is not, however, without risks.
If the European Parliament accepts the council’s selection — still far from certain — Germany’s defence minister Ursula von der Leyen will be the next commission president.
Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF and a former French finance minister, is set to lead the European Central Bank.
The pair would embody a Franco-German dominance at the core of EU decision-making while consolidating the centre-right’s hold on central roles. Their appointment would also mark a decisive assertion of power by member states over the parliament, whose preferred Spitzenkandidat process for picking the commission president is left in tatters.
Both candidates’ accomplishments are irrespective of their gender, but two women leading the EU’s most powerful institutions would show that the bloc can live up to its own liberal values.
What matters more than all of this is how they would carry out their mandates.
Ms von der Leyen possesses qualities required for an effective presidency: intelligent and energetic, she is perfectly multilingual and well-respected across Europe.
Her long experience of defence and security policy is welcome — and unprecedented in a commission president — at a time of growing international uncertainty.
Despite these assets she has many sceptics at home and is untested in the prime ministerial role a commission presidency can be at its best.
Ms von der Leyen should quickly articulate her vision and programme, and show that she can mobilise the required backing.
She should be well supported by her proposed vice-presidents, Margrethe Vestager and Frans Timmermans.
Ms Lagarde, too, is highly experienced and competent.
She meets the most important test for a new ECB president: that she will safeguard her predecessor’s legacy.
Mario Draghi defeated market speculation that the euro might break up, and overhauled the central bank’s arsenal to fit it out for a post-crisis era of stubbornly low rates.
No one doubts Ms Lagarde, too, will do “whatever it takes” in a crisis.
She has done well at the IMF, defying early grumbles that as a non-economist she would be out of her depth.
Her tenure proved her political, communication and coalition-building abilities.
Yet precisely these strengths could be a weakness. The ECB is not the IMF. Technical expertise matters more: in communicating with markets, in getting policy right, and crucially, in rallying other ECB policymakers behind the course she sets. Inside the governing council chamber, coalition-building and political persuasion derive from intellectual authority.
Externally, too, technical finesse is a political imperative.
Mr Draghi had a genius for technically foolproofing policy calls that are politically controversial.
The ECB’s many unprecedented moves have survived legal pushback as a result, and have enjoyed greater political tolerance than they might have.
Being more overtly political is not how Ms Lagarde will be successful, but by showing her mastery of the brief.
She can make good use of Philip Lane, the excellent new ECB chief economist.
Both women are strong communicators and have a keen sense of Europe’s place in a world that is turning its back on the rules-based order.
Risks notwithstanding, Ms Lagarde and Ms von der Leyen have the opportunity to make the EU stronger.

The global bond market enjoyed a powerful rally on Wednesday as investors bet that Christine Lagarde’s nomination to be the next president of the European Central Bank will extend an era of ultra-loose monetary policy in the eurozone.
Bond prices have been on a tear since late last year as, one by one, central banks have indicated concern about the global economy and switched to a more dovish stance.
Outgoing ECB boss Mario Draghi is readying interest rate cuts and a revival of the bank’s bond-buying quantitative easing programme, while the US Federal Reserve is also set to trim rates this summer, at least according to derivatives traders.
Ms Lagarde’s appointment, which has to be rubber-stamped by the European Parliament, is expected to bring more of the same accommodative monetary policy.
“Markets are unfamiliar with her academic monetary leanings,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
“Yet, going by her previous support of Draghi’s decisions to introduce innovative monetary policies, they are making the safe assumption that she is in the dovish camp.”
European bond yields, which move inversely to prices, fell deeper into negative territory on Wednesday morning.
The yield on Germany’s 10-year bond, which serves as a benchmark for the region, hit a record low of minus 0.397 per cent, just a whisker above the ECB’s deposit rate of minus 0.4 per cent.
France’s 10-year yield sank further below zero, touching minus 0.09 per cent.
Two-year yields across the entire eurozone are now sub-zero.
Italian bonds were the strongest in the pack, boosted further by news that the populist government has avoided censure from the EU over its newly revised spending plans.
Ten-year Italian government debt yields have sunk to just under 1.7 per cent, the bonds’ strongest level since the government was formed last year.
Emerging market bonds also enjoyed a Wednesday bounce.
A powerful rally was already under way across the Atlantic, where the yield on the 10-year US Treasury hit a fresh two-and-a-half-year low of 1.94 per cent on Wednesday.
Recent data from the world’s largest economy has been mixed and the latest set of figures were disappointing: US private sector hiring failed to pick up as much as hoped in June, and economic activity in the service sector cooled to its lowest level in two years, according to separate reports released on Wednesday.
The 10-year Treasury is most sensitive to investors’ view of the long-term economic outlook.
The yield on two-year Treasuries, which is more sensitive to Federal Reserve monetary policy, was little changed on Wednesday, having already priced in imminent rate cuts.
US President Donald Trump’s two nominees for the board of the Fed, announced late on Tuesday, are seen to be in the dovish camp.
Judy Shelton, a former adviser to Mr Trump, last month told the Washington Post she thought interest rates should be cut “as fast as possible”.
The second nominee, Christopher Waller, has worked under James Bullard at the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, who was the only member of the Fed’s rate-setting committee who called for an immediate rate cut at its most recent meeting.
Markets are now convinced that looser monetary policy is on the way from several central banks, an assumption that has added fuel to a broad-based fixed income rally in 2019 and pushed the average yield of $57tn of global bonds down to just 1.67 per cent.

Boeing has pledged to commit $100m to help address the needs of families and communities affected by the two deadly crashes of its 737 Max aircraft in which 346 people died.
The US aerospace group said the investment, to be made over several years, will support education, hardship and living expenses for families affected by the two tragedies.
It will also be put towards economic development initiatives in affected communities.
Boeing will work with local governments and non-profit organisations as part of the plan.
“The families and loved ones of those on board have our deepest sympathies, and we hope this initial outreach can help bring them comfort,” said Dennis Muilenburg, chief executive of Boeing, in a statement.
“We know every person who steps aboard one of our airplanes places their trust in us. We are focused on re-earning that trust and confidence from our customers and the flying public in the months ahead,” he added.
Boeing faces a raft of lawsuits from families of victims of two accidents — the crash of a Lion Air flight off Indonesia last October and that of an Ethiopian Airlines plane in March.
The 737 Max has been grounded worldwide since March.
There has been scrutiny of Boeing’s design of the plane and its response to the crisis, but also of the role played by the US aviation safety agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, in the certification of the plane.
The FAA was the last regulator to ground the Max.
There is as yet no firm timetable for when the plane will return to the skies.
Boeing has been working on a software update for the anti-stall system implicated in both crashes but has yet to submit it to the FAA.
A Boeing spokesman said the company’s pledge was “independent of the lawsuits” filed by the families of those on board both flights.
“We’ve been assessing a variety of ways to assist the families and communities impacted and determined that this is a constructive step that we can take now,” the spokesman said, adding that the allocation of money was currently being worked through with local partners.
The company has previously said regulatory and legal considerations have constrained its ability to share information about what happened in the two crashes, but this has left some critics dissatisfied.
Boeing’s response to the crisis “has all been through the lens of liability rather than the lens of openness,” said Samuel Engel, head of the aviation group at ICF, a US-based consultancy, speaking to the Financial Times on Wednesday before the announcement.
The company could not count on international regulators following the FAA’s lead to ensure the Max returned quickly to the skies once it passed a certification test flight.
He predicted, however, that passengers would be willing to fly on the Max again as soon as it returned to service.
“Once the plane is up in the air the crisis moves on very quickly . . . but I think getting from here to there is a bumpy runway.”
Boeing described the $100m as an “initial investment”.
It said the final amount pledged could be higher as its employees will be able to make donations which will then be matched by the company through to the end of this year.

Elon Musk delivered a rebuke to his vocal army of Wall Street doubters as Tesla reported record production and delivery figures for its latest quarter.
Shares in the US electric carmaker rose 7 per cent on Wednesday, capping a 35 per cent rally over the past month that has seen Tesla partially recover after a weak start to the year.
However, the stock is still down a third since its high point last summer, when Mr Musk stoked outrage among his critics by falsely claiming he was close to a buyout of the company.
Tesla said late on Tuesday that it had delivered a record 95,200 cars in the second quarter, compared with 63,000 in the first quarter when it was struggling to deliver its Model 3 to international customers for the first time.
It produced 87,048 cars, an increase from 77,100 in the preceding three months.
The group did not disclose profitability, which was likely to have been affected by its decision to cut prices during the quarter.
It previously said it expected to remain in the red in the second quarter, after posting a $702m loss for the first quarter.
The first-quarter slump had caused worries about weakening demand.
Tesla said on Tuesday that it had taken in orders for more cars during the second quarter than it had delivered.
Analysts at Jefferies said the figures “should alleviate concerns about demand”, while analysts at Nomura said the number of deliveries was “something that we believe many investors considered unlikely earlier in the quarter”.
The growth in order numbers follows price cuts for the Model 3, which the company has pitched as a mass market car.
That has put pressure on profit margins, prompting Mr Musk to push through another round of cost-cutting and raise $2.7bn to boost reserves, after earlier insisting the company did not need any more money.
The latest figures also reflect a partial recovery in sales of the more profitable Model S and Model X, with deliveries up 46 per cent to 17,650.
However, this were still below last year’s average quarterly delivery rate of about 25,000.
Sales may also have been boosted by US consumers buying electric cars before another cut in government subsidies.
The federal tax credit for battery cars, which was previously $7,500, was cut at the start of this month from $3,500 to $1,875, and will be eliminated at the end of the year.
At the company’s annual shareholder meeting last month, Mr Musk hinted that Tesla might push into mining in an effort to secure control over the supply of raw materials that it will need to ramp up battery production.

Beijing is gearing up to channel billions of dollars’ worth of domestic savings to China’s technology companies via a new stock exchange modelled on the US’s Nasdaq, as the sector grapples with slowing venture capital funding and a trade war with the US.
More than 100 tech companies ranging from artificial intelligence software developers to biotech and microchip makers have applied to list on the Shanghai technology board, aiming to raise a combined $16bn.
By comparison, IPOs on Shanghai’s main board last year raised $11.7bn, according to Refinitiv data.
Beijing hopes the Star board, which is set to launch within weeks, will tempt fast-growing start-ups to choose it over Nasdaq by offering them the chance to gain higher valuations, while also giving China’s vast asset management industry an alternative to the financial and industrial stocks that dominate the country’s main Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. Unlike these boards, the new stock exchange will also allow short selling.
Its establishment was announced in November, by China’s president Xi Jinping, in an apparent response to tech start-ups’ complaints of a “capital winter” last year as Beijing slowed credit growth to curb debt levels, hitting venture capital activity.
The tech board has taken on added significance in recent months as Washington’s trade dispute with Beijing has widened to target the rise of China’s tech sector.
A bipartisan bill introduced in the US Congress this month would force the delisting of companies that do not make audit paper trails available to regulators — a move widely seen as targeting Chinese companies, because Beijing has in the past ordered its companies not to comply with such requests, according to venture capitalists advising start-ups looking to list.
Chinese investors fear the impact on US-listed companies of the necessity to comply with local laws restricting business with groups such as Huawei, and that as tensions deepen Washington could one day simply ban Chinese companies from listing.
“Any Chinese company listing in the US could become hostage to the US,” said one venture capitalist who invests on both sides of the Pacific. “Why should they let Chinese tech companies raise money in New York so they can be more competitive against American companies?”
Private valuations for Chinese tech start-ups have risen rapidly in recent years thanks to venture capital funding, and the country now boasts 100 “unicorns”, private companies valued at more than $1bn.
As VC activity has cooled, authorities are seeking alternative ways to channel money to start-ups, particularly those unable to list on China’s existing boards.
The new tech board will be the country’s first to permit lossmaking companies to list, and under its registration-based system approvals will be granted in weeks, rather than months as is the case for China’s two main current boards. Companies with a dual-class shareholding structure, which gives founders greater voting rights over individual investors and has proven popular among entrepreneurs, will also be eligible.
In an effort to curtail potential fraud, banks sponsoring companies will be required to take a 2 to 5 per cent stake in those they back, according to Huang Hongyuan, Shanghai Stock Exchange chairman.
Lu Xianping, founder of Chipscreen, a biotech company that hopes to raise Rmb800m on the board, said: “The crux of the trade war is that as far as the Chinese economy is concerned there are many core technologies which China lacks. This is the task of the tech board: to push China’s technology companies forward”.
There are nine companies with preliminary approval to list on the board, ranging from robotics company Beiren to chipmaker Hejian and targeting an average valuation of Rmb7.3bn （$1.1bn）.
Companies must be incorporated in mainland China to be eligible to list, ruling out the likes of Alibaba and Tencent, which are registered in low-tax jurisdictions overseas.
In addition, the limited liquidity of the nascent board would not be able to support such groups, which are valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
Chinese tech start-ups also expect higher valuations from listing domestically, as their brands have better recognition at home and the country has a huge pool of savings.
“We think valuations on this board will exceed those for similar companies on China’s other main exchanges,” said Zhou Liang of Shanghai Minority Asset, a private equity fund.
Professionally managed funds are expected to dominate trading of shares on the tech board: its rules require companies listing to allocate at least 50 per cent of their listed stock to mutual, social security, pension and insurance funds.
Seven of China’s largest asset management companies have already raised Rmb1bn each to invest in companies listing on the Star board.
Analysts at Galaxy Securities, a Chinese brokerage, expect that Rmb300bn could be raised this year.
Still, Nasdaq’s Asia-Pacific chairman Bob McCooey said last month that the US board anticipated that it could host as many as 40 initial public offerings from China this year, a number that would set a record.
Several tech companies and fund managers, who did not wish to be identified, told the Financial Times they were taking a “wait and see” attitude to the board, citing concerns that investors were immature and therefore there was a greater level of risk.
The founder of one Chinese “unicorn” who was approached by officials to list on the board said Beijing’s tighter political controls have worried private business owners, who seek Nasdaq listings as a way of moving their assets out of the country.
“I’m worried that Chinese markets are still essentially a casino,” said the founder, who declined to be named. “US investors focus more on value fundamentals. I would prefer to list there.”

One year after EU’s groundbreaking General Data Protection Regulation took effect, evidence is mounting that the law has shortcomings and unintended consequences that are hurting businesses, consumers and innovation.
Brussels has set out to make the bloc a leader in the digital economy, and policymakers are actively seeking to make GDPR the global standard for privacy and data use.
Proponents argue that the regulation, which limits how companies can use information that touches on someone’s ethnicity, political opinions, religious beliefs or sexual orientation, is key to building user trust.
But a closer look shows that GDPR is holding European businesses back.
For example, the law requires organisations to explain how they use personal data in artificial intelligence systems and other automated decision-making that has a significant impact on individuals, such as whether to offer a mortgage.
This is far easier said than done.
The complexity of AI systems makes them more accurate, but it also makes their decisions harder to explain.
Businesses that are unable to comply with this “explainability” requirement will end up eschewing advanced AI systems altogether.
In a recent survey by Bitkom, Germany’s digital trade association, 74 per cent of respondents said data protection requirements are the main obstacle to developing new technologies — up from 45 per cent in 2017.
The rollout of GDPR has also coincided with a sharp drop in venture funding for EU tech companies, which raised on average 33 per cent less per deal than in the 12 months before GDPR rolled out.
The regulation has also failed to convince users that they have more control over their data.
Six months after it went into effect, EU consumers’ trust in the internet was at its lowest in a decade.
According to a Eurobarometer survey published in May, internet users in nine EU countries are now less likely to feel they have at least some control over their personal information than they did in 2015, compared with five where they are more likely to feel they have partial control.
（The rest are unchanged.
Moreover, nearly two-thirds of Europeans （63 per cent） either have not heard of GDPR or do not know exactly what it is.
Concerns about the regulation have led more than 1,000 US news sites to block users coming from Europe.
Instead of taking a victory lap, EU policymakers should make targeted reforms to GDPR.
They should help the bloc to adapt better to the use of algorithms throughout the economy by expanding authorised uses of AI in the public interest and allowing the repurposing of data that poses minimal risk.
They should also facilitate the use of automated decision-making by allowing companies to provide basic explanations of how the process works and make fines proportional to harm.
These changes would make GDPR more suitable for the algorithmic economy without undermining the original goals of the regulation.
In addition, reforms could help support companies that are trying to comply with the regulation.
The European Commission vowed to do so, but the UK and French data protection authorities have admitted they are overwhelmed by a flood of companies reporting themselves for violations.
The EU should ensure national authorities have sufficient resources to offer better guidance and address the growing number of breaches.
Furthermore, Brussels should improve co-ordination to avoid diverging national interpretations that add to the legal uncertainty.
We need a GDPR reality check.
Ignoring the regulation’s shortcomings will hold Europe back as it struggles to remain competitive in the digital economy.
As EU policymakers start their new term, they should make the necessary reforms and ensure its second anniversary is more successful than its first.

Chinese companies investing in Africa get a bad rap.
Beyond their alleged role of ensnaring recipient countries in debt, when it comes to their employment record a common accusation is that they employ mainly Chinese workers, depriving locals of potential jobs.
When they do hire locally, critics say, they pay badly and offer little training.
That is certainly the view of many Europeans and Americans, including US officials who have painted a grim picture of Chinese companies’ rapacious practices.
It is also a view echoed in Africa itself.
Many a labourer in Nairobi or executive in Accra turns up their nose at the mention of Chinese business.
But is it true?
Until now there was little way of knowing.
Almost all the information was anecdotal.
Few academic studies of any size or rigour had been conducted.
Now, after four years of intensive fieldwork, that gap has been partially filled by the most comprehensive study of its type yet.
Co-ordinated by the School of Oriental and African Studies and the London School of Economics, researchers compared Chinese and non-Chinese manufacturing and construction companies in Angola and Ethiopia, two of the top African destinations for Chinese direct investment.
Fieldworkers studied 76 companies, 31 of them Chinese.
Crucially, they also interviewed a total of 1,500 Angolan and Ethiopian workers.
To state the conclusion first, the study finds that negative stories about Chinese companies are mostly untrue.
Broadly, it shows they employ just as many local workers as non-Chinese companies, pay them more or less the same and train them to similar standards, though usually less formally.
“Nobody is saying the Chinese are wonderful employers or that the bosses don’t shout at the workers,” says Mr Oya who led the research. But, he adds, there is no evidence to show that Chinese employers, operating in comparable sectors, treat their workforce much differently from non-Chinese counterparts.
In Ethiopia, the study finds that far from packing building sites and factories with Chinese workers, employment rates of Ethiopians [at Chinese companies] are above 90 per cent.
Chinese employees work in management, finance or skilled jobs such as carpentry or production-line supervision, where it may — at least initially — be difficult to find trained Ethiopians.
For unskilled labour, the study finds Chinese companies hire entirely locally.
In Angola, where skills shortages are greater after a ruinous two decades of post-independence civil war, which ended in 2002, labour localisation rates are lower for all companies, not just Chinese. Still, Chinese businesses increased local labour participation from around 50 per cent a decade ago to about 74 per cent.
Far from depriving Africans of work then, the study concludes that, in Ethiopia and Angola at least, Chinese companies have led job-creation efforts.
In 2017, roughly 60 per cent of all African construction business to overseas companies went to Chinese contractors.
On wages, the study finds that, in both Ethiopia and Angola, the skills, experience and class of a worker are more important factors in determining salaries than the employer’s nationality.
Put simply, Chinese companies pay the same.
In Angola, it is true that Chinese construction wages are up to 20 per cent lower.
But Chinese companies provide free accommodation and food, meaning workers can save more of their salary.
In Ethiopia, workers reported spending up to half their wages on food.
“This work supports the notion that there’s very little that is exceptional about Chinese firms,” says Irene Yuan Sun, author of The Next Factory of the World , a book about Chinese investment in Africa. “If I had my way, we’d talk about firms by sector, not by nationality.”
There are important lessons here for African governments.
If they care about job creation and labour conditions — which they decidedly should — they should write them into tenders.
In Angola, this is rarely done.
There is more emphasis on the execution speed of popular infrastructure projects — especially around election time — and, one suspects, on creating opportunities for creaming off a percentage of the contract.
Even in Ethiopia, which has a more serious industrial development strategy, authorities have been surprisingly reticent about setting, say, minimum sector-level wages for the garment or construction industries.
Insisting on skills transfer is another obvious policy choice.
The host government could easily mandate that foreign companies, whether Chinese or otherwise, gradually ratchet up the local skilled-labour component.
One thing that may differentiate state-minded [meaning?] Chinese companies is their responsiveness to a host government’s requests.
African states may be missing a trick.
If they want more jobs and better labour conditions, they should ask for them.

Donald Trump has nominated a prominent critic of the Federal Reserve to serve on its board, as the president continues to take a combative stance towards the US central bank.
Mr Trump announced on Tuesday that he would nominate Judy Shelton, an economic adviser to his 2016 presidential campaign, to the board of the Fed, alongside Christopher Waller, director of research at the St Louis Fed.
Ms Shelton, who is currently the US representative on the board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has previously made headlines for her outspoken views on what she called the “Soviet power” of the Fed.
She told the Financial Times in May that if appointed to the Fed board she would ask “tough questions” about whether it should maintain its rate-setting powers.
“How can a dozen, slightly less than a dozen, people meeting eight times a year, decide what the cost of capital should be versus some kind of organically, market supply determined rate?” she said.
Ms Shelton has also long been sympathetic to the gold standard, which the US fully abandoned in the early 1970s in favour of a flexible exchange rate for the dollar.
She told the FT she wanted a new Bretton Woods-style conference to reset the international monetary system, replacing the current regime, mostly based on floating currencies.
“If it takes place at Mar-a-Lago that would be great,” she added, referring to the president’s golf club in Florida
Last month she told the Washington Post she thought interest rates should be cut “as fast as possible”.
Her criticisms echo those of Mr Trump himself, who has frequently attacked the Fed and its chairman Jay Powell — whom he nominated — for keeping interest rates too high.
Last month he accused the Fed of acting “like a stubborn child” in raising rates too quickly over the past few years.
Mr Waller has not spoken publicly about interest rate policy, but his boss at the St Louis Fed, James Bullard, was the only member of the Fed’s policy setting committee to vote for a cut last month.

There is also the so-called liberal idea, which has outlived its purpose. Our western partners have admitted that some elements of the liberal idea, such as multiculturalism, are no longer tenable.” Thus, did Vladimir Putin claim to be on the right side of history, in a remarkable interview with the Financial Times. But, as Mark Twain might have said, the report of liberalism’s death is an exaggeration. Societies based on core liberal ideas are the most successful in history. They need to be defended against their enemies.
What is “liberalism”?
To answer this question, I would first ask American readers to forget what liberalism means to them: the opposite of conservatism.
This is a uniquely American meaning that makes sense in the unique American context: immigrants who founded their new state on a set of liberal ideas — liberal in the European sense, in opposition to authoritarian.
When Thomas Jefferson wrote of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”, in the declaration of independence, he was building on one of the great liberal thinkers, John Locke, replacing “property” with “happiness”.
The root word in liberal is liber, the Latin adjective denoting a free person, as opposed to a slave.
Liberalism is not a precise philosophy, it is an attitude.
All liberals share a belief in individual human agency.
They trust in the capacity of human beings to decide things for themselves.
This belief has radical implications.
It implies the right to make their own plans, to express their own opinions and to participate in public life.
These attitudes were realised in the system we call “liberal democracy”.
Liberals share a belief that agency depends on possession of economic and political rights.
Institutions are needed to protect those rights — independent legal systems, above all.
But agency also depends on markets to co-ordinate independent economic actors, free media to allow the spread of opinions, and political parties to organise politics.
Behind these institutions are values and behaviours: the distinction between private gain and public purpose needed to curb corruption; a sense of citizenship; and belief in toleration.
Liberalism then demands a balance between conflicting goods.
Some liberals believe more in economic freedom and so oppose an active state.
Others believe more in equality among citizens and fear plutocracy.
Both of these sides can be liberal, broadly defined.
Yet Mr Putin is an enemy of liberalism.
The tradition from which he comes is Tsarist autocracy.
As Anders Aslund argues in Russia’s Crony Capitalism , Mr Putin “has meticulously annihilated the budding institutions of capitalism, democracy, and the rule of law that emerged in Russia in the 1990s. In their place, he has formed a strong vertical of power controlled by his cronies, who oppose the rule of law, favouring their own unlimited powers over the state.”
To measure the success of liberalism, we combine the World Bank’s measure of “voice and accountability” and the Heritage Foundation’s “index of economic freedom”. Economic and political freedoms do tend to go together, partly because both depend on the rule of law. Liberalism, so measured, is associated with prosperity: liberal societies tend to be rich and rich societies tend to be liberal. （See charts.）
Under Mr Putin, Russia has turned away from liberalism.
Largely as a result, Russia’s economy is in a poor state.
Even though gross domestic product per head is less than half US levels, average growth of GDP per head between 2009 and 2018 was only 1.8 per cent a year.
Convergence has slowed to a crawl.
Few expect this to improve.
Mr Putin’s posturing on the world stage is a way of turning the attention of the Russian people away from his regime’s corruption and its failure to give them a better life.
Even in the case of the more successful Chinese economy, we can speculate that Xi Jinping’s turn towards greater state control and political repression will undermine dynamism.
Yet Mr Putin is right on one point.
Liberal democracies have run into difficulties, notably over their ability to absorb immigrants and manage inequality.
Liberal societies do need shared values and identity.
That is perfectly compatible with immigration and enduring cultural differences.
But both need to be managed: otherwise, popular discontent will bring to power leaders who despise the norms of liberal democracy.
The fragile balance might then collapse.
Much that US president Donald Trump says and does indicates his contempt for those norms, notably a free press and an independent judicial system.
The risk then is that liberal democracy will turn into “illiberal democracy”, which is, in truth, neither liberal nor democratic.
In Freedom in the World 2019 , the independent US watchdog Freedom House reported a 13th consecutive year of decline in the global health of democracy.
This decline, it noted, also occurred in western democracies, with the US — the most influential upholder of democratic values — leading the way.
This development is indeed worrying.
Liberalism may be much the most successful approach.
But in many liberal democracies people, especially elites, have forgotten the balance that needs to be struck between the individual and society, the global and the domestic, and freedom and responsibility.
Liberalism is not a utopian project but a work in perpetual progress.
It is an approach to living together that begins from the primacy of human agency.
But that is only the start.
Making that approach work requires constant adaptation and adjustment.
Mr Putin has no idea what this means: he cannot conceive of a social order that does not rest on force and fraud.
We know better.
But we also need to do better — far better.

Democratic lawmakers have sued the administration of Donald Trump in an effort to get their hands on the president’s tax returns, which he has refused to disclose.
The Democrat-led House ways and means committee yesterday asked a federal court to force the Treasury department to hand over the president’s tax returns, marking a new front in the legal battles between Mr Trump and Democrats in Congress.
In April, Richard Neal, the committee’s chairman, demanded six years of tax records under a law that requires the Internal Revenue Service, a Treasury unit, to hand over tax returns to his committee on request.
Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary, rejected the request and a subsequent congressional subpoena.
The justice department issued an opinion in support of his decision last month, arguing that Mr Neal’s request did not serve a valid purpose.
The tussle concerns questions beyond Mr Trump’s tax returns and will help define the boundaries of congressional oversight as the administration mounts a broad effort to resist Democrat-led investigations.
The president has vowed to fight attempts to investigate his administration and business dealings.
He has sued Deutsche Bank to prevent it from complying with a congressional subpoena for his financial records and blocked current and former aides from testifying.
Mr Neal announced the lawsuit yesterday in a short, matter-of-fact statement that noted the Treasury department’s failure to comply with his requests. “Due to that non-compliance, the committee is now pursuing this matter in the federal courts,” he said.
He had argued Mr Trump’s personal and business tax returns were needed to conduct oversight of how the IRS was auditing the taxes of sitting presidents.
The Democrat from Massachusetts had come under pressure from his party’s base to take action to obtain Mr Trump’s returns after Democrats retook control of the House in November.
The party has long sought information about Mr Trump’s taxes after he broke with decades of presidential convention by refusing to release his returns.
The Treasury department did not immediately return a request for comment on the lawsuit.
The filing in the federal district court in Washington argued that neither Mr Trump’s administration nor the courts had the right to question his stated reasons for requesting the tax returns.
“It is not for the executive or the judiciary to examine the committee’s motivations for its oversight inquiries,” it said.
In June, the justice department’s Office of Legal Counsel argued that Mr Neal had not requested the returns for oversight reasons, as he stated, and said “the true aim was to make the president’s tax returns public”.
“In the absence of a legitimate legislative purpose, the disclosure of the president’s tax returns to the chairman was barred by [statute] and the constitution,” the office wrote.

The US economy is enjoying its longest uninterrupted stretch of expansion since at least 1854, leaping over hurdles including the eurozone crisis, turbulence in the developing world and now trade wars to surpass the 1990s economic boom — at least in duration.
Recessions are typically defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking gross domestic product, but the National Bureau of Economic Research — the semi-official arbiter of US booms and busts — uses a broader, more qualitative definition, and reckons that the current expansion started in June 2009.
That means that this month the US expansion has now hit its 121st month, making it longer than the golden era enjoyed by the economy from March 1991 to March 2001, and more than twice as long as the average post-WWII expansion.
“This cycle has now been going on for longer than The Beatles were together. It has persisted for a more extended stretch than the original run of Seinfeld on network TV. It’s older than Instagram,” observed Brian Levitt, a strategist at Invesco.
Gauging recessions is tricky, even when one is in the middle of one, so it is at least theoretically possible that the US economy might already be in a funk.
The NBER did not declare that the US was in a recession until December 2008, a year after it decided the economy had begun to shrink, and did not announce that it had officially ended in June 2009 until September 2010.
This year, the US economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.2 per cent in the first quarter and is still growing by about 1.5 per cent, according to the “nowcasting” model of the Atlanta Fed, making it likely that the record has in fact been broken.
Yet the new record comes at a time when some economists and investors fear that the next downturn is looming.
Global economic data has been mixed, and a recent truce between the US and China on trade has done little to allay concerns that the end of the post-crisis recovery may be nigh.
Equity markets rallied after the weekend’s G20 summit, but bond markets were relatively unmoved by the tentative de-escalation of trade tensions.
Interest rate futures indicate that traders think the Fed is going to have to cut interest rates aggressively over the next 12 months to ensure that growth remains on track, but some investors think the expansion will probably end soon.
“As uncertainty around trade policy is unresolved, the impact on the growth outlook is becoming more pronounced,” said Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley’s chief economist.
“Business confidence and [corporate investments] have slowed to multiyear lows. We project global growth to slow even further, and any sustained escalation from here raises recession risks.”
The post financial crisis recovery has also been weaker than most other economic setbacks since the second world war.
US GDP is now about 20 per cent bigger than its pre-crisis peak.
In contrast, the 1990s boom increased the size of the US economy by 41 per cent, according to RBC Capital Markets.

Amid extraordinary scenes of vandalism and havoc as youthful protesters over-ran Hong Kong’s parliament building on Monday evening, two striking images stood out.
One was the hanging of a colonial-era Hong Kong flag on the speaker’s lectern in the main chamber of the legislative council — a highly provocative move guaranteed to boil the blood of China’s leaders.
The other was the orderly and deliberate retreat by the police from their defence of the building, a calculated decision that allowed excited young protesters with no clear objectives to run amok.
It is inconceivable that the police abandoned their posts without the consent of Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam.
It is also very unlikely she made that decision without first seeking Beijing’s permission.
So if the retreat was indeed a tactical one that deliberately allowed demonstrators to wreak havoc in the city’s symbolic heart, what was the goal?
Ms Lam, presumably with Beijing’s backing, appears to be gambling that the scenes of violence and senseless destruction will turn the majority of Hong Kong’s population against the young activists, whose principal demand now is for the chief executive to resign.
The chaotic scenes and extensive property damage may also be used to justify mass arrests of the young demonstrators who took part.
Hong Kong remains a deeply conservative society and public support for past protest movements, including the so-called Umbrella Revolution in 2014, have dwindled as their inconvenience to daily lives has increased.
Ms Lam and her backers may have been emboldened by a counter-protest on Sunday at which tens of thousands of mostly older demonstrators marched through central Hong Kong to show their support for the police and her government.
That march was far smaller than the black-shirted demonstrations that have swept through the city demanding Ms Lam’s resignation and the total repeal of legislation that would allow people in the territory to be extradited to mainland China.
But it reinforced the assertion by Beijing and Ms Lam that a “silent majority” in Hong Kong supports her and loves the motherland.
While an estimated 550,000 marched peacefully in opposition to her government on Monday, the wrecking of parliament will strengthen her narrative that protesters are a small group of hooligans who have been manipulated by “hostile foreign forces” seeking to harm China’s interests.
But Ms Lam and Beijing appear to have opted for a high-risk strategy.
The chief executive has proven herself to be incredibly tone deaf when it comes to heeding the will of the people and there is no guarantee that the deplorable scenes of vandalism will turn the wider public against the protests.
Already perceived as a lame duck, allowing the city’s parliament to be overrun only strengthens the perception of her weakness.
Unlikely as it is, if Ms Lam acted on Monday without Beijing’s permission, it could provoke China’s hardline leaders to intervene more forcefully, perhaps even by deploying Chinese troops in the city for the first time.
The relative ease with which the unorganised youths occupied the legislative building before police calmly reclaimed it several hours later could actually embolden the movement to seek a more prolonged occupation.
If mass arrests come next it will definitely radicalise many of the city’s youth and lead to still more unrest and possibly a worsening cycle of violence.
As the turmoil continues in one of the world’s leading financial centres, Ms Lam and her bosses in Beijing have once again opted for short-term tactical advantage without a clear idea of the wider strategic objective.

After bitcoin fizzled and popped early last year, Wall Street seemed to lose interest.
Goldman Sachs went quiet on plans to open a desk trading digital assets as the price of the cryptocurrency plummeted, falling as much as 80 per cent.
In October last year JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon doubled down on his initial scepticism, saying he did not “give a shit” about bitcoin at a conference.
But now that prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have climbed back up, some senior figures in the financial services industry are thinking again, wondering whether it was the spike or the crash that was the anomaly. Flow Traders, an Amsterdam-based listed trading firm specialising in exchange-traded products, announced in April it was adding cryptocurrencies to its line-up. Last month a group of 50 companies including Jump Trading and DRW — two high-frequency trading houses — and Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, a crypto merchant bank, formed a group to develop a “deep, efficient and secure” market.
“Over the past two years we have seen evidence building that bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset class so it makes sense to add it to portfolios,” said Marcus Swanepoel, a former Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered banker now running Luno, a crypto company.
Bitcoin’s trajectory has certainly been eye-catching.
Its price has more than doubled in two months, finishing the week around $11,800.
This is some way off the highs of late 2017, but enthusiasts say the rally will continue.
Chief among the reasons offered by bulls are Facebook’s recent announcement that it will launch a new digital currency next year — which came a few months after JPMorgan created its own “coin” for payments — and a sharp turn in monetary policy from the US central bank.
Along with dovish noises from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, that has helped drive the value of negative-yielding debt around the world to about $12.7tn, according to data tallied by Bloomberg and Barclays.
In that context, yield-less gold looks appealing — as does bitcoin.
“There is a lot of demand coming from Asia and Japan where bitcoin represents a wave of hope against a deflationary monetary environment,” said David Mercer, chief executive of LMAX Exchange, a currency-trading platform with about $400m a day in crypto volumes, which started offering cryptocurrencies last year. “It’s become a safe haven of the digital space.”
While demand for crypto remains driven by retail investors, particularly in Asia, institutional practitioners are increasingly getting involved, drawn by fat spreads and increasing volumes.
According to Mr Mercer, six of the largest high-frequency traders on LMAX’s fiat-currency platform are active in the crypto market as well.
In public, big banks remain wary, although a head of electronic trading at a large US lender said traders would jump at the opportunity to trade crypto — a market with a total capitalisation of $336bn — if given the chance.
Jan Strømme, a veteran of currency markets, set up a crypto-focused trading firm Alphaplate in August.
He says young programmers and quantitative traders are shunning careers at banks to work at crypto-focused companies as interest from institutional traders picks up.
Graham Rodford, founder and chief executive of Archax, another crypto platform, started trading bitcoin six years ago as a side project from his day job as head of compliance at Omni Partners, a London-based hedge fund.
A former head of operations at HSBC, he is betting that in the future hedge funds will do their fundraising through platforms such as Archax, and will trade all asset classes — including stock and bonds — in digital form.
“We have come a long way in terms of the market structure already with skilled professionals from the traditional world moving into this new emerging world and bringing with them a wealth of experience,” he said.
Arch critic Nouriel Roubini, who described crypto in May as “the mother and father of all bubbles”, is engaging in debate.
Next week he is due to go head to head in Taiwan with Arthur Hayes, the founder of crypto exchange BitMex, and a former equities trader at Citi and Deutsche Bank, in an event billed as “the Tangle in Taipei”.
To Mr Swanepoel, the world is slowly moving towards a new monetary system.
He believes his firm will soon be competing with the biggest banks, as the underpinnings of the financial system undergo a radical shift.
“The holy grail of the internet is to be able to move value peer-to-peer safely and securely and we can do this now with blockchain technology,” he said. “We just don’t yet know if it’s money or bitcoin or something else we should be moving around.”
Mr Mercer agrees. “Today the most efficient way to move money to Australia is to get on a plane and fly there with a suitcase,” he said. “This is clearly not going to last if you believe in blockchain technology.”

European leaders have agreed a deal to fill the EU’s most important jobs, backing Christine Lagarde to lead the European Central Bank and Ursula von der Leyen to be president of the European Commission.
On the third day of a gruelling summit in Brussels, EU leaders gave near-unanimous support for a deal based on Ms Lagarde, France’s ex-finance minister who is now head of the IMF, and Ms von der Leyen, Germany’s defence minister.
But the proposed deal remains unconfirmed because it is facing resistance from parts of the European Parliament, which must support Ms von der Leyen’s appointment.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel had to abstain on the deal, because of resistance from some of her party’s coalition partners in Berlin.
The deal means the two most important policymaking jobs in the EU would be held by women for the first time.
The breakthrough ends five weeks of wrangling to fill the main policymaking roles in the EU, which has never had to fill all its key roles within such a short period of time.
The chosen team will steer the bloc through an age of upheaval, handling Brexit, the aftermath of the financial crisis and trade policy with regard to US protectionism and Chinese power.
The selection of Ms Lagarde, not an economist or one of the front-runners to replace Mario Draghi, was unexpected.
She has become a star of global finance after eight years as head of the IMF and four as French finance minister.
But she has no direct experience of monetary policy which could prove a disadvantage as the ECB searches for new ways to combat weak inflation and boost the eurozone economy.
Several senior officials attending the summit said Ms Lagarde was linked to Ms von der Leyen as part of the deal between Paris and Berlin.
Ms von der Leyen is a longstanding ally of Ms Merkel and the only minister to have served in every cabinet since Germany’s chancellor took office more than 13 years ago.
She would be the first German to head the commission in half a century.
Her nomination to replace Jean-Claude Juncker at the commission is set to ensure the centre-right European People’s party retains the most coveted post in Brussels.
Other parts of the package agreed yesterday place Charles Michel, Belgium’s liberal prime minister, as the next European Council president, while Josep Borrell, Spain’s foreign minister, is set to become the EU’s foreign policy chief.
Diplomats said they expected Frans Timmermans and Margrethe Vestager, the lead candidates for the socialists and liberals in May’s European elections would be rewarded with jobs as vice-presidents under Ms von der Leyen.
The position of European Parliament president would be a separate but related part of the compromise, which needs the approval of political groups in Strasbourg.
Names under consideration include Sergei Stanishev, the Bulgarian socialist; Manfred Weber, the German MEP who led the EPP election campaign; and Ska Keller, the German Green.
Ms Lagarde said she was “honoured to have been nominated for the presidency of the European Central Bank.”
She added: “I have decided to temporarily relinquish my responsibilities as managing director of the IMF.”

Digitalisation has reshaped how we communicate, organise, interact, move and trade.
It is now changing money.
Mobile-phone based electronic payments are becoming just like cash: contactless, cheap and easy to make on a peer to peer basis, including across borders.
Life without a bank account becomes possible, which helps financial inclusion in places with no banks and high mobile penetration.
Many companies are seeking to exploit the synergies between money and platforms in a digital economy.
In China, Tencent and Ant Financial aggregate payments with social and commercial activities for millions of users.
Facebook and 27 partners have announced plans for a Libra digital coin.
For governments and central banks, the digitalisation of money raises new challenges and the Bank for International Settlements warned this week that they are coming “sooner than we think”.
First, physical cash may be disappearing as a medium of exchange.
Trust in banks has depended on the perceived convertibility of deposits to cash.
In a cashless society, there would be no direct access by citizens to sovereign money.
Deposits would no longer be convertible with possible detrimental effects on financial stability.
Second, the monetary system may become more fragmented.
The economic logic of networks and platforms means they have an incentive to maximise user numbers and a tendency to evolve into closed systems.
They may create “digital currency areas” where participants are kept together because they share and exchange the same type of digital money.
Third, because digital money is naturally cross-border, it opens the way to new forms of currency competition, from Libra among others.
Some governments may try to use digital payment networks to internationalise their currencies, while others will face a risk of “digital dollarisation” through the penetration of foreign currencies in their domestic economy.
This has the potential to significantly reshape the international monetary system.
Sovereign governments have the power to protect their currencies.
They can decide which money serves as legal tender and in which currency taxes must be paid.
They can force private payment systems to be open through technical interoperability.
They can require the acceptance of cash.
And they can strictly regulate e-money issuers, as China began doing in 2018.
They should do more.
The general public is entitled to keep access to central bank money as technology changes.
If cash is eliminated, it should be replaced by a digital equivalent, known as Central Bank Digital Currency.
The Swedish Riksbank and others are already considering the merits and dangers of CBDCs for monetary policy and financial stability.
On the one hand, CBDCs may strengthen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy by allowing interest （including at negative rates）, to be paid on the currency.
On the other, they could imperil financial stability by offering an attractive （riskless） substitute to bank deposits and increase the risk of runs.
However, there is a more fundamental argument to be had about the balance between private and public money in our societies.
A CBDC would protect the pre-eminence of public money in a digitalised economy.
It would maintain effective convertibility of private into public money and provide a defence against digital dollarisation.
For that purpose, a CBDC should be as close as possible to cash.
It should be a complement, not a substitute, to bank deposits.
It should not carry interest.
Whether it should be anonymous, as cash currently is in certain limits, is a fundamental social choice.
It must be openly debated as the digitalisation of money forces us to reconsider and rethink the place of privacy in our lives.

At the Seokwang Hi Tech factory on the southern outskirts of Seoul half of the production lines making parts for semiconductor equipment sit idle.
The company took out a Won1bn （$860,000） loan a year ago to expand its production facilities and cash in on booming orders.
But a two-year boom in computer memory chips has turned; prices started falling late last year.
Already struggling to meet its interest payments, Seokwang Hi Tech has had to sack 30 per cent of its workforce, as sales have fallen 50 per cent this year.
“People talk about the second-half recovery but I see no signs yet,” said Lee Do-won, president, forecasting full-year sales to halve to about Won1bn.
“I am not sure how long our company can withstand the downturn,” said Mr Lee. “I may have to seriously consider closing down the factory if things don’t get better by the end of next year.”
Seokwang is not alone. Many of South Korea’s small electronics companies have been hit hard by the cyclical downturn in the memory chip sector, which has been exacerbated by the slowing global economy, the US-China trade war and the export controls on Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment company that has been a huge customer for chips.
A sense of crisis is building in the supply chain as big customers like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix reduce capacity because of growing uncertainty.
Their plight is a signal that the tech downturn is worse than many realise, as global politics delays a recovery in the chip cycle and prices fall further than expected.
“The trade war and the Huawei issue are distorting supply and demand and increasing chip inventories overall,” said Kim Young-woo, an analyst at SK Securities.
Rising inventories will lead to greater pricing pressure for suppliers in the second half, analysts said.
IHS Markit, a data company, expects the industry’s worst downturn in a decade this year, forecasting the global microchip industry’s sales to fall 7.4 per cent to $446.2bn this year.
IC Insights, a market researcher, expects most chipmakers to be “very conservative” with their capital spending next year, given the poor market conditions this year.
“The perceived second-half demand recovery is increasingly unlikely; producers’ inventory is rising in the third quarter off record levels,” Morgan Stanley said in a recent report.
High levels of inventory remain a big concern for suppliers as the US campaign against Huawei damps chip demand.
Huawei is one of the Korean tech sector’s biggest customers, buying about Won80tn of semiconductor components a year.
Analysts estimate that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, the biggest memory chipmakers, have about 5 per cent to 15 per cent sales exposure to Huawei.
“A heated US-China trade war may send demand in the second half of this year into quick freeze,” according to a note issued by DRAMeXchange, a consultancy that watches the markets for dynamic random-access memory chips, which help devices perform multiple tasks, and NAND chips, which provide long-term data storage.
“For 2019, it is feared that suppliers will come under prolonged pressure to adjust price downwards,” DRAMeXchange added.
Growing pricing pressure is causing a headache for tech start-ups such as QS TAG, which supplies equipment for a US semiconductor maker. “Our customer is asking for steep price cuts as they tighten their belts,” said Lee Dong-hoon, president. “But our margins are already quite low so I am not sure how to cope.”
The tech downturn and the trade war are weighing on South Korea’s economic performance as manufacturers are highly integrated with global value chains.
The South Korean economy contracted unexpectedly in the first quarter, with private investment in production facilities down almost 20 per cent year on year.
Moon Jae-in, South Korean president, replaced his top economic advisers on Friday on concern over the deteriorating economy.
Fitch Ratings has recently slashed its growth forecast for the Korean economy to 2 per cent this year as prices of memory chips, one of its biggest export items, are unlikely to recover this year.
There are not many options for small suppliers to deal with the growing external headwinds.
Although the weaker local currency could help exporters, companies say the forex gains will not be enough to offset growing pricing pressure.
The Korean won is hovering around its weakest point against the greenback since early 2017.
“Actually, the exchange rate is our biggest concern because we have to buy semiconductor-related materials in dollars,” said Choi Won-chang, head of IDF, a parts maker that generates about 30 per cent of sales through exports.
“But our customers are demanding price cuts, citing the weaker Korean won, squeezing our margins further.”
Mr Choi pre-emptively took out a bank loan last September to secure enough operating funds as he expects the trade war between China and the US to continue for the next couple of years, making the business environment more unfavourable.
“Things are likely to get worse,” Mr Mr Choi added. “But there is not much that small companies like us can do about it, other than just cost-saving, to stay afloat.”

Iran has breached internationally-agreed limits on its enriched uranium stocks in a further blow to a landmark nuclear deal that President Donald Trump abandoned last year.
Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, revealed on Monday that the country’s stockpile of enriched uranium had expanded, a development the International Atomic Energy Agency later said it had investigated and confirmed.
In May Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic republic would exceed limits on the nuclear deal within 60 days unless the remaining signatories to the nuclear deal took steps to counter the impact of US sanctions.
That deadline expires on July 7.
The development on Monday ratchets up the brinkmanship between Tehran and Washington and leaves France, Germany and the UK struggling to save the accord amid security fears in the Gulf region.
Mr Trump — after speaking with French president Emmanuel Macron about Tehran’s announcement — told reporters that Iran was “playing with fire”.
Earlier, the White House said in a statement that it had been “a mistake” to allow Iran to enrich uranium “at any level” under the Obama-era deal.
“There is little doubt that even before the deal’s existence, Iran was violating its terms,” the White House press secretary said. “We must restore the longstanding non-proliferation standard of no enrichment for Iran.”
One European diplomat admitted it was becoming “increasingly difficult” to sustain the 2015 accord, which offered Iran relief from many international sanctions in exchange for accepting curbs on its nuclear programme.
Iran has insisted it wants to keep the pact alive, but it has demanded the remaining signatories provide more economic support.
Another European diplomat said the move was expected, saying it was “regrettable but reversible”.
Jon Alterman, Middle East director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the breach by the Iranians was “intended to be alarming”, but was “not surprising”.
“I don’t see how the US has much standing to complain about Iran not abiding by any agreement the US has said is deeply flawed and walked away from,” Mr Alterman said.
Mr Zarif told reporters on the sidelines of a mourning ceremony that Iran had “surpassed” a 300kg limit on its stockpile of uranium enriched to a low level, a breach Iran had threatened in a package of measures announced on May 8.
“We consider this as part of our rights under the nuclear deal,” Mr Zarif said. But he did not reveal the size of Iran’s enlarged uranium stockpile.
Iran has previously warned that it may take a more provocative step by busting curbs on the enrichment levels.
The nuclear agreement allows Iran to enrich uranium up to a purity of 3.67 per cent, but officials have said they could start enriching it up to 20 per cent, which would hasten Tehran’s ability to reach weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent.
The agreement is not a legally binding treaty, but if Iran were to continue accelerating its atomic activity the European signatories Germany, France and the UK — known as the E3 — would face a dilemma.
They would have to choose whether to support the agreement in the hope of keeping it alive, or trigger a “dispute mechanism” that could lead to the revival of UN sanctions and the deal’s collapse.
The EU urged Iran to “reverse this step and to refrain from further measures that undermine the nuclear deal”, a spokesperson for the bloc said.
European countries were in close contact with other parties to the accord over Tehran’s move, the official added.
“The EU remains fully committed to the agreement as long as Iran continues to fully implement its nuclear commitments,” the spokesperson said.
Mr Zarif said the deal allowed Iran to stop implementing parts of its commitments when other signatories failed to deliver on its promised economic dividends.
Tehran previously justified its move to increase its inventory after Mr Trump in April refused to renew waivers on sanctions that stop transferring its enriched uranium to other countries.
The three European states last week launched a long-awaited payments channel to buoy EU-Iran trade in the face of US sanctions.
But Mr Zarif said the channel, known as Instex, was “not sufficient”.
“So, the Islamic republic of Iran will carry on with its plans [for deal limit breaches] according to the timetable announced before,” he said.
Breaching the 300kg limit would begin to take away the “breathing space” created by the deal, said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution.
“This particular move in and of itself doesn’t manifestly change Iran’s breakout timeline. It doesn’t put Iran much closer to nuclear capability.”
Iran’s move follows weeks of rising tensions between Tehran and Washington.
Iran has denied US claims that it is responsible for spate of attacks on oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz.

President Donald Trump’s promise to soften his stance on Huawei will have little effect on the Chinese telecoms equipment maker, according to its founder, who has pledged to continue its shift away from American suppliers.
Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder, told the Financial Times that Mr Trump’s decision to soften a ban on US companies selling chips and software to Huawei would not have “much impact” on its business as it adjusts to a new era of American hostility.
“President Trump’s statements are good for American companies. Huawei is also willing to continue to buy products from American companies,” Mr Ren said.
“But we don’t see much impact on what we are currently doing. We will still focus on doing our own job right.”
His remarks were made a week after an initial FT interview, conducted before Mr Trump gave Huawei a partial reprieve, in which Mr Ren stressed his company’s doctrine of self-reliance.
“The US is helping us in a great way by giving us these difficulties. Under external pressure, we have become more united than ever,” Mr Ren said last week.
“If we aren’t allowed to use US components, we are very confident in our ability to use components made in China and other countries.”
Mr Trump surprised many in Washington and Beijing over the weekend by agreeing to reverse a decision that had, in effect, imposed a ban on US groups selling software and equipment to Huawei.
The move came as part of a more general truce in the US-China trade war.
The move was a big concession to China, which has insisted that the fate of Huawei should be settled as part of the trade talks between the two countries.
Mr Trump will meet senior officials over the coming days to discuss how far to go in easing pressure on Huawei, but he faces conflicting domestic pressures.
On one side, US tech companies are lobbying for a significant relaxation of the Huawei ban.
On the other, many China hawks want Mr Trump to restrict Huawei even further because of the threat they say it poses to national security.
One person familiar with the situation said: “The [National Security Council] will be meeting on this as soon as possible, and it is likely to take some time for the administration to figure out how exactly it is going to keep everyone on board here — from Beijing, to US industry, to the China hawks in his own party.”

Richard Li is getting a little old for the nickname “Superboy”.
But at 52, he has another chance to show he has the flair of his father, Li “Superman” Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s best-known entrepreneur.
His vehicle is FWD, an Asian insurance consolidator backed by Swiss Re.
Deals to buy businesses in Thailand and Hong Kong look shrewder than a misfiring push into tech businesses more than a decade ago.
FWD has bought the Hong Kong operations of MetLife of the US cheaply.
Analysts believe the deal was priced below the company’s present （embedded） value of $400m.
A $3bn swoop on the life insurance unit of Siam Commercial Bank looks pricier.
Rapid Thai premium growth is one justification.
Greater scale is another.
That would help FWD with a mooted float.
Since inception in 2013, FWD has stressed that it will focus on Thailand, Japan and Hong Kong.
The SCB Life deal adds an important piece to the jigsaw.
At home in Hong Kong, things are not as simple.
FWD is much smaller than AIA, Prudential or China Life, who dominate Hong Kong’s $68bn insurance market.
China has huge potential.
Less than a tenth of its population of 1.4bn have life insurance.
But securing a mainland insurance licence would be a rare feat.
As FWD waits hopefully for approval, it has to content itself with luring mainland clients via Hong Kong.
Unfortunately, dealing with Chinese clients through Hong Kong will be the best FWD can do for now.
Chinese regulators have discouraged mainlanders from buying Hong Kong insurance.
Yet, this has not stopped Chinese customers from using the policies as a hedge against the yuan.
MetLife Asia sales were up 13 per cent in the first quarter, mainly from China.
Mr Li’s strategy of buying up unloved outposts of banks and foreign insurers makes sense.
But can he integrate them successfully?
That is the question investors would need to answer positively to participate in any flotation.
Flair is nothing without finesse.

HSBC has launched a lobbying effort to convince the Chinese government that it is not responsible for the arrest of Huawei’s finance director, as the bank tries to distance itself from the diplomatic row over China’s top telecoms equipment maker.
The UK-listed bank stepped up engagement with Chinese officials after the arrest in December of Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei executive who is also the daughter of the company’s founder, according to several people briefed on the discussions.
Ms Meng is out on bail in Canada, where her lawyers are trying to stop her extradition to the US to face charges of bank and wire fraud in an indictment that also alleges that Huawei conducted business in Iran in contravention of US sanctions.
HSBC provided information that helped US prosecutors build the case against Ms Meng and Huawei in a move that has infuriated executives at the telecoms group, according to people familiar with the matter.
John Flint, HSBC’s chief executive, and other senior representatives of the bank have told Chinese officials that it had little choice but to co-operate with the investigation after the US Department of Justice requested information on its relationship with Huawei in 2017, according to three people briefed on several of the discussions.
In 2017, HSBC was operating under the supervision of an independent monitor appointed by the DoJ in 2012 after the bank was fined $1.9bn for breaching sanctions and helping Mexican drug cartels launder money.
Mr Flint defended the bank’s co-operation with the DoJ investigation in a meeting earlier this year with the Chinese ambassador to the UK after he was called to the embassy in London following Ms Meng’s arrest, two of the people said.
HSBC’s chief legal officer, Stuart Levey — who served as a senior US Treasury department official with responsibility for financial crime in the George W Bush and Obama administrations — also attended the meeting, they added.
“The Chinese are very angry at the treatment of [Ms] Meng and have asked us about our role in her prosecution,” said one HSBC insider briefed on the discussions. “We’ve told them we had a US monitor, with between 200 and 400 people inside the bank at any given time, that had access to everything: stonewalling the DoJ was not an option.”
One person advising HSBC described the situation as “incredibly sensitive” for the bank, which generates nearly 75 per cent of its profits in Hong Kong, the autonomous Chinese territory, and mainland China.
HSBC’s nervousness underscores how companies fear getting caught up in the sparring between Beijing and Washington, especially when they have adopted growth strategies predicated on expanding in China.
As well as a wholly-owned retail and commercial bank and joint ventures in asset management and insurance in mainland China, HSBC in 2017 became the first foreign bank to launch a majority-owned securities venture in Shenzhen.
The bank terminated its relationship with Huawei in 2017 over “risk concerns regarding [its] business practices”, according to an indictment against Huawei and Ms Meng, which was filed in a US court earlier this year.
The indictment alleges that Huawei “repeatedly misrepresented” its business dealings in Iran to HSBC and several other banks.
The Chinese telecoms group told the banks that “although [it] conducted business in Iran, it did so in a manner that did not violate applicable US law”, whereas “in reality” it was breaking the law, the indictment alleges.
HSBC — which is described as a “victim institution” by the DoJ and is not under investigation — terminated its relationship with Huawei in 2017.
The bank’s attempts to distance itself from the Huawei furore have been complicated by the Chinese telecom group’s efforts to shift the focus on to its erstwhile bank, which had banked with the company since the mid 1990s.
Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s chief executive and founder, challenged US prosecutors’ characterisation of HSBC as a victim institution in a recent interview with the Financial Times.
Mr Ren said HSBC had known “from the beginning” that a Huawei affiliate called Skycom had business interests in Iran and that the bank “understood Skycom’s relationship with Huawei”.
“This can be proven by emails between the bank and Huawei, which have the bank’s logo on them. From a legal perspective, they can’t claim they were deceived or knew nothing, because we have evidence,” he added.
A spokesperson for HSBC said: “We are not a party to this case so it is not appropriate for us to comment.” The Chinese embassy in London declined to comment.
A person briefed on the investigation said the US government had been building a case against Huawei long before the bank became involved in 2017.
One person close to HSBC said there was little evidence that the bank had fallen out of favour with the Chinese government, pointing to the bank’s involvement in several recent initiatives between the UK and China.

The abiding image from this year’s G20 summit will not be Donald Trump sharing another chuckle with Vladimir Putin. It is the clip of his daughter, Ivanka, inserting herself into an awkward circle of world leaders.
The video, released by the French government, shows varying expressions of tortured politeness as Ms Trump intrudes on a discussion between France’s Emmanuel Macron, Britain’s Theresa May, Canada’s Justin Trudeau and Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF.
Ms Lagarde, in particular, was unable to conceal her irritation.
What they were discussing is secondary.
Mr Macron made a point about social justice.
Mrs May replied that people notice when the economy is brought into it.
Ms Trump then interrupted with a non sequitur about how the defence industry is male-dominated.
The real point is that America’s self-named “First Daughter” is rarely out of the frame at global summits.
Other Trump officials are almost invisible compared with Ms Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, the only two White House players who are thought to be immune from Mr Trump’s trademark phrase: “You’re fired.”
By contrast, leaders of patrimonial countries, such as Saudi Arabia, are very comfortable with Ms Trump’s role.
Mohammed Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, conducts much of his US communication over WhatsApp with Mr Kushner.
The first son-in-law is also a favoured conduit for other leaders.
Rex Tillerson, the former US secretary of state, recently disclosed that he had found out his Mexican counterpart was in Washington when he stumbled across him dining with Mr Kushner.
Both Mr Kushner and Ms Trump have a large array of portfolios and unparalleled Oval Office access on any topic.
Mr Kushner is in charge of the stillborn Arab-Israeli peace plan, which he launched in Bahrain last week with no Palestinians present.
Ms Trump is in charge of a women’s entrepreneurship fund, which is run out of the World Bank and funded mostly by the Gulf states.
She is also in charge of US workforce training.
Her father said she was uniquely qualified to lead the US skills drive because she had created “millions of jobs”.
In reality, Ms Trump’s accessory companies, which she no longer directly runs, created hundreds of jobs, almost all of them in China.
Both Ms Trump and Mr Kushner were denied high-level security clearance by the White House personnel office.
Mr Trump overruled the bureaucrats.
It is thought that their extensive overseas business ties offered ample conflicts of interest.
If you google “Ivanka Trump clearance”, the first item that comes up is cut price sales of Ivanka product lines.
The larger question is whether Ms Trump harbours political ambitions of her own.
At the G20 summit in Hamburg two years ago, Ms Trump sparked outrage when she briefly stood in for her father at a round table of world leaders.
Ms Trump’s prominence has only grown since then.
At the end of this latest summit, Ms Trump provided a video briefing of Mr Trump’s meetings with Japan’s Shinzo Abe and India’s Narendra Modi.
Mr Trump has also been encouraging talk of dynastic succession. Last week he tweeted an image of Trump re-election banners starting from 2024 and escalating quadrennially into eternity. The meme ended with “Trump4Eva”. Whether Mr Trump was trolling his critics, or is genuinely nurturing a dynasty, is an open question.
Earlier this year, Mr Trump said he had considered appointing his daughter as US ambassador to the UN.
He had also thought about making her head of the World Bank.
He said he pulled back because he would have been accused of “nepotism”.
Because neither job would have come close to offering the power Ms Trump and her husband already have, Mr Trump’s comments must be taken with a pinch of salt. Mr Trump often treats politics as an extension of his business. The latter has always been tightly held within the family. His White House seems to be little different.

The global manufacturing slump deepened in June, with data from around the world illustrating the extent to which the US-China trade conflict is weighing on growth.
A global manufacturing index produced by JPMorgan and IHSMarkit fell to its lowest level since 2012 in June, with new orders weakening sharply and business optimism at the lowest level on record.
Its monthly reading of 49.4 — down from 49.8 in May — indicated a majority of firms reported falling output.
Global markets had rallied yesterday after Donald Trump met Chinese president Xi Jinping at the G20 summit, softening his stance on dealing with China’s tech group Huawei and reaching an agreement to resume trade talks.
But economic data gave a reminder of the damage done by the prolonged stand-off between the world’s two largest economies and by the escalation in trade tensions.
A series of other data releases yesterday captured the dismal performance from manufacturers globally.
In China, manufacturing suffered a relapse after three months of growth, with the Caixin-Markit purchasing managers’ index slipping below 50.
Eleanor Olcott, economist at the consultancy TS Lombard, said falls in new orders in both this survey and in official data suggested China’s domestic economy was slowing, on top of the impact of tariffs on the country’s exports.
Other economies in the region are suffering.
South Korea — often seen as a global bellwether — recorded the biggest year-on-year fall in exports for three-and-a-half years in June, according to preliminary data.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Tankan index for large manufacturers slipped to its lowest level since 2016, reflecting the slowdown in key Asian export markets.
The picture is just as bleak in the eurozone, where most manufacturers in all of the region’s large economies except France reported falling output.
In the UK — where the sector’s woes have been compounded by Brexit-related uncertainty — the index of activity produced by IHS Markit sank to its lowest level since 2013.
The US is the only region in which manufacturing activity appears to be expanding, but even here the trend is worrying: the Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of activity, also published yesterday, pointed to the slowest growth since October 2016, and new orders have weakened.
Economists see little prospect of a near-term economic rebound.
Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, said manufacturing could stabilise as Chinese stimulus “worked its way through the system”, provided there was no further escalation in trade tensions, but added that the G20 deal “is not a circuit breaker”.
“The impact of trade tensions on business confidence is becoming more pronounced,” said Chetan Ahya, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, adding that developments at the G20 summit were not enough to remove the uncertainty around trade policy that was holding back investment.
The worst of the manufacturing slowdown has been in intermediate goods — the most commonly traded cross-border.
Consumer goods have been less affected, with demand underpinned by strong employment and a pick-up in wage growth in developed economies.
But the downturn in manufacturing could lead to job cuts and so spread to the services sector.
Mr Schmieding said the prospect of a cut in US interest rates, and of further stimulus from the European Central Bank, could support sentiment and boost financial markets, but was unlikely to turn around the manufacturing sector.

The truce in the US-China trade war announced after the G20 talks on Saturday was welcome, but does not appear to pave the way for a more comprehensive trade deal in the foreseeable future.
Instead, tariff levels have been frozen, with no deadline set for further progress.
President Donald Trump offered some concessions to China, apparently allowing a resumption of trade with Huawei on its consumer products, while maintaining restrictions on its “strategic” products such as the 5G network system.
In return, China has promised to buy more US agricultural products, although the exact amount is unknown.
This outcome was broadly in line with the market’s expectations ahead of the summit.
Because of the removal of the immediate tail risk of much higher tariffs, there may be a relief rally in some asset classes in the coming days.
But a more fundamental shift in investor opinion probably requires a more durable settlement of the tariff issues, and greater signs of progress on the more strategic problems concerning intellectual property, IT and China’s industrial policy.
It has become clear that these are all thorny and intractable disputes that are unlikely to blow over rapidly.
Trade wars and the markets
The latest flare-up in the tariff wars started with Mr Trump’s aggressive tweets on May 5, following some backtracking on commitments that China had given earlier in the talks.
Since this fundamental shift in approach by both sides, global bonds have rallied sharply, with 10-year Treasury yields in the US falling from 2.54 per cent to 2.00 per cent.
The market has also markedly shifted its assessment of monetary policy in a dovish direction.
It now expects almost five reductions of 25 basis points each in the Federal Reserve’s policy rate before the end of 2020, while the central bank itself is expecting only a single cut.
Market optimism that the Fed and other central banks are willing to ease monetary policy very aggressively has underpinned equity markets in the face of negative demand shocks throughout the advanced and emerging economies.
The US stock market has managed to remain unchanged since the deterioration in US-China relations in early May.
Trade uncertainty has damaged global business confidence, but for now this is being offset by easier monetary conditions.
Unlike the situation in the final quarter of 2018, when tariff threats were combined with forward guidance about tighter policy from the Fed and the European Cental Bank, global financial conditions have this time supported risk assets.
According to Goldman Sachs the global financial condition indices tightened by almost 100bp during 2018, but have been broadly unchanged this year.
Following the G20, this monetary policy support remains crucial in persuading investors that sluggish global activity growth will not develop into a full blown recession.
This seems consistent with the latest global activity data, although growth is clearly below trend in most of the major economies, and has shown little sign of rebounding around midyear.
Nowcasts sluggish as manufacturing slumps
The latest Fulcrum nowcasts for global activity indicate that activity growth is around 3 per cent, which is about 0.7 percentage points below trend （see box）.
The advanced economies have slowed even more than the emerging economies, which is somewhat hard to explain, given the degree of concern about tariff wars.
The common thread that has driven the global economy has been the slowdown in manufacturing and industrial sectors, with goods production growth declining to about zero this year.
Weakness in the goods sector has been consistent with two factors that may have been connected with higher tariffs.
Imports and exports growth have fallen much more than gross domestic product, possibly because of disruptions in global value chains, especially in Asia, causing temporary disruptions in goods supply.
In addition, there has been a continuing slowdown in fixed investment in many economies, which may have been due to declines in business confidence connected to uncertainty about future tariffs.
Fortunately, service sectors, consumer confidence and labour markets have so far been entirely unaffected by these developments.
Largest economies out of sync
While subpar global growth has been recorded throughout the first half of 2019, the three largest economies — the US, China and the Euro Area — have not been perfectly synchronised during this period:
US activity appeared fairly robust in the first few months of the year, but the growth rate has dipped to only 1.5 per cent during May and June;
The Euro Area began the year close to recession, with Germany apparently being hit by transitory shocks in the auto, chemicals and pharmaceuticals sectors. Germany has remained surprisingly subdued since these transitory shocks started to abate, and there has been only a moderate rebound in the eurozone as a whole, taking activity growth up to 0.7 per cent;
Chinese activity growth has been very bumpy this year, with industrial activity rising sharply in February, only to subside even more sharply in the spring.
Overall, growth has been running at the bottom end of the authorities’ 6-6.5 per cent target range, and is only being held there by progressive easing in fiscal and monetary policy.
With the tariff war now in limbo, markets will be focused on the next significant shift in global activity data.
Assuming that the Federal Reserve maintains its recent dovish rhetoric, that move seems more likely to be upwards than towards recession.
Latest nowcasts for the world economy
The global economy has been growing about 0.7 percentage points below trend throughout 2019 and is not improving . . .
The advanced economies have been particularly weak, with growth running about 1.0 percentage points below trend and 2.5 points below the peak rates seen 18 months ago . . .
Each of the three largest economies has slowed sharply since late 2017, when tariff threats started to dominate sentiment . . .
The goods sectors have been much weaker than service sectors, as trade in goods and fixed capital expenditure have dragged down growth in industrial production to around zero . . .

Not many finance chiefs can claim to have steered two record-breaking listings and still be around to line up a third.
But Maggie Wu, chief financial officer at Chinese tech giant Alibaba, is on track to pull it off.
“She’s got staying power, that’s for sure,” said one longtime observer.
It nearly did not happen.
Alibaba’s top executives spent several months trying to lure Ms Wu from Beijing, where she was an accountant at KPMG, to its Hangzhou headquarters, but they secured her in time for the group’s first initial public offering in November 2007.
The record-breaking flotation generated $57bn in orders, and subsequent trading strained the stock exchange trading systems, according to news reports at the time.
But even after such a promising debut, unanswered questions remained: just what was this company’s business model?
According to Alan Hellawell, an analyst turned venture capitalist, Ms Wu remained an unflappable constant — “a real steady Eddie” — as Alibaba morphed from a B2B company with 5,000-plus employees generating revenues of Rmb2.16bn （$315m） to a tech conglomerate staffed by more than 100,000 people and with sales of $56bn.
Ms Wu’s consistency sets her apart from many of her peers, he added. “I’ve seen a lot where internet stardom goes to their heads and the way they treat analysts and other constituents changes for the worse.”
Colleagues applaud her understanding of the multiple units that make up one of the world’s most complex organisations. “Maggie isn’t just a numbers CFO,” said one executive who has worked closely with her. “She is very much an operational, get-down-and-understand the business units. And we have a lot of business units!”
Those who have worked with her also attest to her approachability and lack of ego.
Like the rest of Alibaba’s top executives, Ms Wu lives in Hong Kong, which is where the group has its finance and legal functions.
As chief financial officer, she keeps the books for one of the world’s most valuable companies — and also one of the most acquisitive.
Following last week’s management reshuffle, Ms Wu will also now oversee Alibaba’s strategic investments, working alongside vice-chairman Joe Tsai.
Bankers, with whom she has regular dealings on both capital markets and dealmaking, are fulsome in their praise for her.
“She’s highly professional, highly competent,” said one who has worked with her for many years. “She always seems totally in charge, totally on top of things.”
There is a lot to be on top of.
Alibaba is a sprawling and complex empire with 600-plus subsidiaries.
It has its share of lossmaking business lines, such as movies and healthcare, and has clashed with regulators at home and overseas.
There is an ongoing investigation into its accounting practices by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and it is on the blacklist of “notorious markets” for violations of intellectual property rights.
Following a controversial privatisation in 2012 as part of continuing efforts to refocus its business strategy, Alibaba returned to the public markets with a splash in October 2014, launching what remains the world’s biggest initial public offering nearly five years later.
However, the path to market second time round was riven with conflicts, not least over venue.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange balked at Alibaba’s unique structure, which hands disproportionate control to a small group of partners.
The exchange’s subsequent rule change to allow weighted voting rights paved the way for Alibaba to plot a planned secondary listing there later this year.
One veteran investor, who participated in both flotations, credits Ms Wu with promoting greater transparency and communication when Alibaba ran into headwinds.
The company hit a trough around October 2015, she said, when Chinese consumers were migrating from PCs to mobile.
“The numbers were not stacking up as well as they had thought,” the fund manager said.
“That’s probably when Maggie stepped more into the investor communications role and really helped to steer the message towards ‘let’s give more facts and data to the investor community and let them understand what we are doing to overcome these challenges’.”
Mr Hellawell said Ms Wu helped instil a similar “voice of reason and stability” after the first IPO, when investors were questioning the many changes in Alibaba’s business model, founder Jack Ma’s thinking and the company’s somewhat ropey corporate governance.
She may control the finances of one of China’s most forward-thinking companies, but Ms Wu is also a believer in more ancient arts, including yangshen, or “nourishing life”.
She lost her voice just before the last quarterly earnings, but after dosing up on traditional Chinese medicine she was able to field questions during the hour-long call and attend a smaller investor lunch the following day.
During the lunch she sang the praises of the medicine, and her doctor — whose contact details she was sure to pass on to anyone who asked.

The keys to the house that Jack built are being handed over.
Alibaba, founded by Jack Ma 20 years ago, has now paved the way for the two men who built the Chinese ecommerce giant to exit: Mr Ma steps down as chairman in September, and executive vice-chairman Joe Tsai is decanting some of his responsibilities.
Last week, less than a year after Mr Ma announced his departure, Alibaba said that Maggie Wu, chief financial officer, would take on strategic investments, working alongside Mr Tsai.
Messrs Ma and Tsai are inextricably linked with the company, which has grown to a market capitalisation of $400bn-plus and last year generated revenues of $56bn.
Mr Tsai, said Duncan Clark, a tech consultant who wrote a book on Alibaba, is “the alter ego to the more unpredictable Jack” — an urbane, Yale-educated lawyer as comfortable talking with the heads of sovereign wealth funds as with local merchants.
His retirement is not imminent: instead, the moves highlight Alibaba’s famously long-term succession planning.
“We started talking about succession in 2002 because we were expanding so fast,” said an early executive.
That planning, said Alibaba, has created a deep bench of talent.
Those include Jeff Zhang, whose mandate has expanded rapidly in the past year to include the fast-growing cloud business, and Wang Lei, who is in charge of food delivery business Ele.me.
Both men symbolise the new breed of ba ling hou, or post-1980s-born, taking up top-ranking roles as the external landscape shifts.
Economic growth at home is slowing, fewer new internet users are coming online, and competition — not least because Alibaba spawned a thousand copycats — is escalating.
Beijing is keeping its tech giants on a tighter leash, and the expanding trade war with the US has hobbled M&A and jolted supply chains.
The immediate challenges fall to Daniel Zhang, chief executive and chairman-elect, and Ms Wu.
The pair, both accountants, are expected to run a more administrative-style management that is more domestically focused — the latter also partly due to the US-China tensions.
Ms Wu, who joined Alibaba in 2007 and has been chief financial officer since 2013, “is one of the most accessible and reliable executives I have worked with,” said an industry executive who, as an analyst, spent 15 years following her.
Latterly, he said, he’d taken to referring to the “Maggie Wu Leadership Standard” to evaluate chief financial officers and other investor-facing executives.
The additional responsibilities she now assumes, which essentially see the investment team heads report to her rather than to Mr Tsai, is a small step — and one Alibaba deems logical given the importance of not just acquiring stakes in companies but also integrating them within the ecosystem.
Nor do they imply she is necessarily being groomed to step into Mr Tsai’s shoes.
“Maggie’s strengths are more in the traditional CFO area,” said a person familiar with the company’s thinking.
However, in taking on strategic investments, she is entering a key engine of the business.
Alibaba’s 350-or-so-strong portfolio is roughly half that of rival Tencent’s, but it is still large enough to rank alongside those of private equity firms.
It has a team of roughly 100 people and, on last year’s numbers, contributed 30 per cent of group profits.
While bankers who have worked with the team say it is stamped with Mr Tsai’s imprimatur, the company insisted it is the same DNA that already infuses the finance function, once headed by Mr Tsai himself.
That function is “much more than keeping the books and taking care of taxes,” said the person familiar with the company.
Still, “I don’t see [Ms Wu and Mr Zhang] cooking up international investment plans,” said Mr Clark. “It would be more of a committee approach rather than dealmaker approach.” Already, he added, the company is becoming more centralised, with more reporting lines going back to Hangzhou headquarters.
Such concerns are shrugged off internally.
Rank-and-file employees report business as normal, while higher up the chain, the person familiar with the group noted: “People said, you cannot replace [Apple founder and chief executive] Steve Jobs, but Tim Cook and team have done a hell of a job growing Apple to the next level.”
Besides, as Joseph Fan, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s School of Accountancy and Department of Finance, noted, Alibaba has unique features that dilute the role of its top management team.
“It is a protected company [with limited competition] that is heavily influenced by government policy,” he said. “Even if the government is not at the forefront, I think the government will closely watch major decisions such as succession at Alibaba.”
Secondly, it boasts a partnership structure, of which Messrs Ma and Tsai are lifetime members and which borrows from similar structures at accountancy and law firms.
It nominates the majority of board members and counts on SoftBank and Yahoo, two of Alibaba’s early investors, to vote alongside it, essentially giving the partnership a controlling vote.
That could prove key.
As Lawrence Loh, director at the National University of Singapore’s Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations, said: “It’s not actually about management — that’s straightforward. It’s the systems and procedures you put in place. It’s beyond the business: is that gung-ho, never-say-die attitude still there?”

JPMorgan’s asset management arm will have to pay a 33 per cent premium to take control of its Chinese joint venture, setting an expensive precedent for other international fund managers as foreign institutions race to tap China’s $5.3tn market.
An exchange filing by JPMorgan’s local partner Shanghai International Trust disclosed a net asset valuation from an external third party of Rmb9bn （$1.3bn） for the JV, China International Fund Management （CIFM）.
But the filing set a minimum bid price for the 2 per cent stake on auction at Rmb241m, which instead values CIFM at Rmb12bn.
JPMorgan Asset Management declined to comment on the filing by Shanghai International Trust, which is owned by state-run Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.
But the US fund manager has previously said it wants to take a controlling stake in the joint venture.
The deal is not yet a sure thing, however, as the deadline for potential bidders to register is July 26.
Peter Alexander, managing director of Z-Ben Advisors, a consultancy that advises foreign asset managers in China, said that while JPMorgan would likely enjoy right of first refusal, other foreign and domestic companies would be free to place bids as well.
He pointed to a deal in 2018 in which a 51 per cent stake in a unit owned by Guotai Junan Securities was widely expected to be acquired by China Pacific Insurance without any competition.
Instead, a company called Golden Sun Securities came up with its own surprise competing bid, drawing out the process.
While the upstart bidder was later disqualified, Mr Alexander warned that in China, “until the deal is done anything can happen”.
Shanghai International Trust revealed in May that it would auction the 2 per cent stake in CIFM this year — a sale to JPMorgan would raise the US company’s stake to 51 per cent while reducing that of its Chinese partner to 49 per cent.
It would be the first foreign fund manager to attain a 51 per cent stake in its Chinese JV, although rival Invesco controls its own JV despite a minority holding.
Research group Oliver Wyman has forecast China’s investment market should grow to $9.3tn by 2023, from about $5.3tn now, putting it in second place globally behind the US.

Jony Ive will be always be hailed as the designer who helped turn a struggling computer company into the world’s first trillion-dollar business.
The departure of Apple’s chief design officer to found a new design company signifies the turn of a page in the history of industrial design.
The British-born Ive, knighted in 2012, helped turn Apple into a producer of devices built around innovative design.
The company will need to maintain his creative approach, even as it pivots away from relying on iPhones as its primary money-spinner.
Sir Jonathan joined Apple in 1992, shortly before it ran into financial difficulties.
Steve Jobs’s return in 1997 helped reverse that descent.
The deep friendship and creative partnership between the two was central to Apple’s fusing of form and functionality, software and hardware.
Sir Jonathan drew on former Braun chief designer Dieter Rams for his most famous invention, the iPhone.
Modernist looks were intimately linked to its main product innovation, the multitouch screen.
Apple did not invent the smartphone, but it produced its enduring aesthetic.
The future relationship between Sir Jonathan and Apple remains unclear.
Nevertheless, his loss as chief design officer comes at a time of growing uncertainty for the company, which derives two-thirds of its revenues from iPhone sales.
Key markets have suffered a slowdown: in China, sales fell by nearly 22 per cent in the last quarter compared to 2018.
Users are upgrading more slowly than in the past, criticising high costs and the incremental upgrades between generations.
There is also stiff competition from other manufacturers.
Over the past decade, Google, Huawei and other technology companies have converged on the minimalist lines Sir Jonathan drew in 2007, offering lower-cost and higher-specification phones.
At its developers’ conference this month, Apple hinted at its desire to break its iPhone addiction by the lack of hardware — bar a $6,000 “cheese grater” workstation aimed at professionals — on show.
For consumers, services took centre stage.
These included the new Apple TV+ streaming service — a rival to Netflix and Disney+ — and a games subscription package called Apple Arcade.
The company faces a future in which the iPhone is not enough.
Apple will have to sell users an ecosystem including apps, virtual assistants and more, where rivals Google and Amazon have already made inroads.
Apple should be mindful of the threat from competitors.
Its bigger problem may be internal reshaping, however, and its impact on innovation.
It is unclear whether the new design team will have the same clout.
While Sir Jonathan worked directly with the chief executive, his successor will report to the chief operating officer.
This is not doomed to failure: Apple runs on cross-disciplinary teamwork between designers and software engineers.
It should be wary, however, that it does not stifle future products while streamlining the corporate structure.
Sir Jonathan joined Apple when it was a US company with a small market share and a limited user base.
Thanks in part to his design skills he leaves it a global behemoth, though one with a clouded future after a decade of iPhone-fuelled good times.
His designs helped turn Apple into a Big Tech leader.
Without Sir Jonathan, innovation at Apple may seem daunting.
But fresh thinking and new blood can do a company good.
Apple underwent just such a transformation in the 1990s.
Armed with lessons from history and a mighty war chest, the company is well placed to think differently.

It is nearly 30 years since Rudiger Dornbusch and Sebastian Edwards published a seminal book, The Macroeconomics of Populism.
Their conclusion back then was that the economic policies of populist leaders were quintessentially irresponsible.
These governments, blinded by an aim to address perceived social injustices, specialised in profligacy, unbothered by budget constraints or whether they might run out of foreign exchange.
Because of this disregard for basic economic logic, their policy experiments inevitably ended badly, with some combination of inflation, capital flight, recession and default.
Salvador Allende’s Chile in the 1970s, or Alan García’s Peru in the 1980s, capture this story perfectly.
These days, the macroeconomics of populism looks different.
Of course there are populist leaders out there whose policies follow, more or less, the playbook of the 1970s and 1980s.
Donald Trump may prove to be one of those, with a late-cycle fiscal expansion that seemed to have no basis in economic reasoning; Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by some accounts, may be another.
But a much more interesting phenomenon is the apparent surge in populist leaders whose economic policies are remarkably disciplined.
Take Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
When it comes to fiscal policy, it is odd indeed that this fiery critic of neoliberalism seems fully committed to austerity.
His budget for 2019 targets a surplus before interest payments of 1 per cent of GDP, and on current plans he intends to increase that surplus next year to 1.3 per cent of GDP.
He has upheld the autonomy of the central bank and, so far at least, his overall macroeconomic framework is anything but revolutionary.
Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban offers another example of conservative populism.
Under his watch, budget deficits have been considerably lower than they had been previously, helping to push the stock of public debt down from 74 per cent of GDP in 2010, the year Orban took over, to 68 per cent last year.
This emphasis on the virtues of fiscal prudence is also visible in Poland, where Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s PiS has managed public finances with sufficient discipline in the past few years to push the debt/GDP ratio below 50 per cent last year, the first time this has happened since 2009.
The obvious question is: what has changed in the decades since Dornbusch and Edwards went into print?
One answer is that today’s populists tend to strive for national self-reliance, which encourages them to avoid building up any dependence on foreign capital.
And since that goal is achieved by keeping a tight rein on macro policy, fiscal indiscipline is avoided in order to limit vulnerability to foreign influences.
Perhaps this is because the “them”, or the perceived enemy, for many of today’s populists tends to be outside the country rather than inside.
Broadly speaking, it is the forces of globalisation — and global capital in particular — that are the problem for these leaders, and self-reliance is the only way to keep those forces at arm’s length.
This helps to explain why, for example, Mr Orban has been so keen to repay debt to Hungary’s external creditors.
He has relied instead on selling bonds to Hungarian households to finance his deficits, even though the interest rates on those bonds are much higher than he would pay to foreign creditors.
It also helps explain why the PiS in Poland has presided over a decline in foreign holdings of its domestic bonds.
Foreign investors owned 40 per cent of Poland’s domestic government debt back in 2015, but only 26 per cent now.
In other words, among many of today’s populists there is a blurring of the distinction between populism and nationalism.
And the nationalistic urge to keep the rest of the world off your back seems to dominate the populist urge to spend money.
The perfect example of that instinct is Vladimir Putin: not necessarily a populist, but his administration has been emphatic about the need to keep public spending low and to build solid financial buffers.
National self-reliance is an economic obsession for the Russian government, and provides a model for other countries who wish to insulate themselves from international finance.
One of the reasons why the macroeconomics of populism have changed in this way is the historical legacy of economic disaster.
If you are a populist leader in a country where financial crisis is part of living memory — as it is in Mexico, Hungary and Russia, say — you might do well to err on the side of conservatism for fear of repeating the mistakes of your predecessors.
But another reason why populism looks different for countries like Poland, Hungary, Mexico and Russia has to do with mere luck.
Hungary and Poland, in particular, enjoy the luck of geography: having been absorbed into the EU, they have received financial transfers from Brussels averaging some 3-4 per cent of GDP in the past few years, so that populism in these countries has been solidly underpinned by the terms of their EU membership.
Mr López Obrador is enjoying the inheritance of his predecessor’s sound macro policy, together with a buoyant US economy and low US interest rates.
Russia has had the good fortune of oil exports to rely on.
The thing about luck is that it can run out.
So maybe it’s not quite time yet to bury the old macroeconomics of populism.
But for the time being, it seems true to say that many of today’s populists have an unexpectedly robust sense of economic discipline.
David Lubin is head of emerging markets economics at Citi.

Just before midnight, Vladimir Putin perks up at the mention of the word “risk”.
It encapsulates the man and his 20 years in power.
Latterly, Russia has embarked on a growing number of foreign policy gambles, from the military intervention in Syria, the annexation of Crimea and the attempted meddling in the US presidential election.
Is his appetite for risk increasing with each passing year?
“It did not increase or decrease. Risk must always be well-justified,” he replies. “But this is not the case when one can use the popular Russian phrase: ‘He who doesn’t take risks, never drinks champagne’.”
His response is classic Putin: elusive and teasing.
But on one issue, he is certain he made the right choice: Syria.
“I believe that it has been a good and positive return. We have accomplished even more than I had expected.”
Aside from the killing of “several thousands” of Islamist militants and the shoring up of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, he cites the re-emergence of Russia as a power in the Middle East uniquely able to talk to all parties from Israel to Saudi Arabia and Iran.
“Besides, I would like to openly speak of the mobilisation of the Russian Armed Forces,” he adds. “Our Armed Forces have received such practical experience that they could not have obtained during any peacetime exercises.”
This matter of fact — some would say cynical — summation of an eight-year civil war that has led to the deaths of half a million people and caused 5.6m to become refugees and millions more to be internally displaced highlights the self-assurance of Mr Putin. Here is a man who believes Russia is back at the top table and that history is on his side.
Ever since the 2014 Crimea annexation, Mr Putin has faced a concerted attempt to isolate him internationally.
But on the eve of the G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan and at a time when the US role in the world has never seemed more uncertain, the Russian leader is still very much at centre stage.
During a 90-minute interview in the Kremlin’s cabinet office, with statues of four of Imperial Russia’s most revered rulers looking on from each corner, the former KGB officer turned statesman took on all subjects.
He ranged from the breakdown of the international rules-based order, the rise of China and the end of liberal ideology to the prospect of improved relations with the UK.
Ahead of the G20, Mr Putin highlights multiple risks to global stability.
He singles out American unilateralism, starting with the tariff war against China and the threat of conflict in the Gulf.
“To put it bluntly, the situation has definitely become more dramatic and explosive,” he says.
The Russian leader detects a shift in the political balance of power from traditional western liberalism to national populism, fuelled by public resentment about immigration, multiculturalism and secular values at the expense of religion.
“Have we forgotten that all of us live in a world based on biblical values?” asks Mr Putin, dismissing Karl Marx’s dictum that religion is the opium of the masses.
Similarly, in the Russian president’s view, liberal ideology has “outlived its purpose”.
Fragmentation characterises the world of 2019.
In response, Mr Putin casts himself as a cheerleader of globalisation alongside his increasingly close ally, President Xi Jinping of China.
It is an improbable role for Russia and China, but one vacated by the US under President Donald Trump, who has made “America First” his mantra.
Mr Trump’s trade conflict with China, alongside US-led sanctions against Russia, have brought Beijing and Moscow closer together.
Once wary neighbours, the two Eurasian powers have formed a strategic partnership based on energy investment, trade and defence co-operation.
Mr Putin has met Mr Xi 28 times since the latter took office in 2012.
Is Russia — which has few friends left in the west — putting too many eggs in the Chinese basket?
“We have sufficient eggs but there are not too many baskets to put those eggs in,” he replies. “We always assess the risks . . . Russia and China are not directing their policy against anyone.”
Later he praises China for “showing loyalty and flexibility to both its partners and opponents” — an endorsement not extended to the US.
Some believe conflict is inevitable between the US and China.
They point to the parallel between a dominant Sparta and a rising Athens, the so-called Thucydides trap.
The Russian leader is circumspect.
“But it is hard to say whether the United States would have enough patience not to make any rash decisions, but to respect its partners even if there are disagreements.”
Mr Putin has plenty of harsh words about America but he is studiously polite about Mr Trump, referring to him as “Donald” several times in the interview.
“Mr Trump is not a career politician . . . I do not accept many of his methods when it comes to addressing problems. But do you know what I think? I think that he is a talented person. He knows very well what his voters expect from him.”
Mr Putin wearily dismisses charges of orchestrated interference in the 2016 US presidential election campaign.
He insists Mr Trump won in his own right by tapping the anti-establishment mood and the backlash against globalisation.
“Russia has been accused, and, strange as it may seem, it is still being accused  . . . of alleged interference in the US election. What happened in reality? Mr Trump looked into his opponents’ attitude to him and saw changes in American society, and he took advantage of this,” he says.
Mr Trump has reciprocated by not directly criticising Mr Putin.
The two leaders are scheduled to meet at the G20 in Osaka.
The question is whether they can find any common ground, notably on arms control, where bilateral cold war treaties that have underpinned nuclear stability are being torn up.
The US, accusing Russia of breaching the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, has notified Moscow it will withdraw by August 2 in the absence of compliance.
Russia denies it is in breach and accuses the US of counter-breaches though missile deployment in Europe.
At the same time, a second treaty （New Start） limiting the number of warheads is nearing expiry in 2021.
Mr Putin tells the Financial Times that Mr Trump intimated in a recent conversation that the US was interested in extending New Start, but no initiative has been forthcoming.
“So if this treaty ceases to exist, then there would be no instrument in the world to curtail the arms race. And this is bad.”
Of the many gambles Mr Putin is accused of taking, the attempted assassination of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England in 2018 ranks high.
Even 15 months on from the nerve agent attack which London blames on Moscow, Mr Putin bristles and says it is time to move on.
“Listen, all this fuss about spies and counterspies, it is not worth serious interstate relations. This spy story, as we say, it is not worth five kopecks.”
While the nerve agent attack did not kill Mr Skripal nor his daughter, a member of the public died after coming into contact with a perfume bottle containing the nerve agent novichok, which British officials say was manufactured in Russia.
“The list of accusations and allegations against one another could go on and on . . .  We need to just leave it alone and let security agencies deal with it,” says the Russian leader.
The same disdain in the face of international criticism surfaces in relation to Russia’s backing for President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela who has installed an effective dictatorship.
Mr Putin denies that Russia is directly involved in propping up Mr Maduro, arguing this is one more Russophobic conspiracy theory propagated by the west.
The only presence of Russians are military contractors servicing defence assets, he says, adding that more could be sent.
Mr Putin immediately raises the toppling of Libyan leader Muammer Gaddafi by western powers and the ensuing civil war: “So why should we do the same in Venezuela? Do we want to revert to gunboat diplomacy? What do we need it for? Is it necessary to humiliate Latin American nations so much in the modern world and impose forms of government or leaders from the outside?”
The Russian leader insists this is a matter for Venezuelans to resolve for themselves.
As for Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader recognised by the US and other western governments as the legitimate president, Mr Putin says: “He may be just wonderful, and his plans are good. But is it enough that he entered a square and proclaimed himself president?”
A popular uprising in Russia — encouraged by the west — is the stuff of nightmares for Mr Putin.
Having witnessed first hand the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the fall of the Soviet Union, he has long harboured suspicions of western conspiracies to undermine his regime.
The colour revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine, as well as the US-led interventions in Iraq and Libya, have further convinced him of malign intentions.
For now, Mr Putin looks politically formidable. But his regime’s weakness lies in the economy, with stubbornly low growth and years of falling real incomes.
“But the most important task we need to achieve is to change the structure of the economy and secure a substantial growth of labour productivity through modern technologies.”
Such a goal has long eluded an economy heavily dependent on oil and gas.
Russian citizens are feeling the pinch through higher taxes and an unpopular increase in the pension age which triggered a fall in Mr Putin’s trust rating to a 13-year low this spring.
But rather than increasing spending, Mr Putin is building a war chest.
International reserves stand at about $500bn, according to the Russian central bank.
“We need to create a safety net that would let us feel confident  . . . Do not think that this money is just sitting on the shelf. No, it creates certain guarantees for Russia’s economic stability in the midterm.”
This is an expensive insurance policy, but it comes amid the threat of further US sanctions against Russia, which since 2014 has found itself increasingly cut off from western capital markets.
Just this week the Foreign Affairs Committee in the US House of Representatives approved a draft law that would sanction entities involved in the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline being built between Russia and Germany — a move that would be a blow against critical energy exports.
Believing himself surrounded by real and potential enemies, Mr Putin has routinely chosen strength and aggression over compromise and restraint. His proudest accomplishment, he admits, is the restoration of the power of the Russian state after the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union, an event he describes as “one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century”.
Mr Putin has no yearning for the communism of the past, where, he says: “life was difficult”.
The tragedy, he says, was the dispersal of ethnic Russians across the newly-independent successor states of the USSR.
“25m ethnic Russians found themselves living outside the Russian Federation. Listen, is this not a tragedy? A huge one! And family relations? Jobs? Travel? It was nothing but a disaster,”
Throughout the two decades of his leadership, Mr Putin has expended blood and treasure in efforts to rectify what he sees a historical wrong.
His favourite leader, he declares, is Peter the Great.
A towering bronze statue of the visionary tsar looms over his ceremonial desk in the cabinet room.
Peter the Great created the Russian empire around the turn of the 18th century with a series of foreign wars that conquered land from Finland and the Baltic states in the north, to the Black Sea in the south.
This is the sphere of influence that Mr Putin believes Moscow must protect at all costs; hence his visceral opposition to Nato’s expansion eastward up to Russia’s borders.
Of Peter the Great, Mr Putin says: “He will live as long as his cause is alive.”
Mr Putin cannot yet claim to be a grand domestic reformer on the scale of his hero.
Nor has he shown any sign of developing a clear succession strategy.
The constitution requires him to stand down as president in 2024.
The 66-year-old says he has contemplated his succession “since 2000”, but if indeed he has, it is the most closely guarded secret in Russia and a matter of some sensitivity for the president himself.
As the clock ticks towards 1am, Mr Putin cannot resist one final jab, this time at the efforts of Britain’s ruling Conservative party to choose a new leader to succeed Theresa May.
Either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt will then become prime minister without a general election.
“It is different from what you have in Great Britain. We are a democratic country” he says. “The choice is always made by the Russian people.”
In fact, Mr Putin inherited the presidency on the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve 1999, when Boris Yeltsin stepped down from office prematurely and endorsed him as his successor.
When reminded of this, the president shrugs: “So what?”

China’s slowing economic growth, a trade war with the US and weakening currency are causing significant declines in spending by its tourists overseas.
Chinese people made 150m border crossings last year and are crucial to the global travel market, accounting for about a fifth of tourism spending worldwide, according to the United Nations’ World Tourism Organization.
But they spent 10 per cent less outside the country in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, according to official data.
Industry executives and analysts say China’s slowing economic growth combined with the depreciation over the past year of its currency, partly as a result of the trade war with the US, are to blame.
That is causing them to favour  domestic travel or to downgrade to cheaper trips. “Middle-class travellers will choose cheaper travel options,” said Peter Liao, who operates a travel agency in Shanghai specialising in European trips. “The exchange rate is a factor. It is getting difficult for tour operators to fill up their more expensive packages.”
Popular destinations for Chinese tourists such as Thailand and Vietnam have reported low single-digit declines in Chinese visitors this year while some long-haul destinations are reporting more dramatic falls.
Visits from China to New Zealand fell 21 per cent in April compared with the same month a year earlier.
In Australia, arrivals from China fell 6 per cent in April.
China overtook New Zealand as the largest source of travellers to Australia last year when they spent A$12bn （$8bn） in the country — more than a quarter of total spending by international visitors.
Air China axed its Sydney to Shanghai and Melbourne to Shanghai routes in March.
“We are undoubtedly starting to see slower rates of growth as the market matures,” said John O’Sullivan, managing director of Tourism Australia.
Chinese visits to the US fell nearly 10 per cent year on year in 2018 to 2.9m, according to the country’s tourism office, after Washington’s imposition of tariffs on Chinese exports caused the renminbi to depreciate against the dollar.
American businesses indicate the slowdown has continued this year.
US jewellery brand Tiffany this month told investors that domestic sales to Chinese tourists declined more than 25 per cent in the first quarter.
Beijing last month issued a warning on travel to the US.
Some destinations closer to home, such as Japan, have continued to see double-digit growth. Chinese visitor arrivals at its 20 most important destination countries that account for 50 per cent of overseas trips grew 6 per cent in the first quarter, according to data from consultancy Gavekal Dragonomics, but that was down from 23 per cent growth last year.
“Overseas travel is being hit with a double whammy of a weakening currency and rising political tensions,” Ernan Cui, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics wrote in a note. If the trade war worsens, “more downward pressure on the renminbi would translate into more downward pressure on Chinese outbound tourism”, she added.

At the beginning of July, the US’s current economic expansion will officially become its longest one since 1854, the year National Bureau of Economic Research data on business cycles started.
Unemployment is at a 49-year low.
Asset prices are near record highs.
And the US Federal Reserve signalled yet again last week that it was leaning towards lowering rates due to “uncertainties” in the economic outlook and muted inflation.
That intuitively makes sense when you consider how rocky geopolitics are at the moment, and how bifurcated this recovery has been, mostly favouring large multinational companies and individuals with lots of assets.
But it is also rather stunning how quickly the Fed has gone from tightening monetary policy to preparing to ease it, and concerning that the central bank will be working from a historically low rate base as it attempts to navigate the next recession, whenever it comes.
Even more disturbing, this oddly long economic cycle is not singular.
A Deutsche Bank research paper looked at 34 US economic expansions over the past 165 years and found that the past four business cycles have been longer than average.
In fact they account for four of the six longest cycles.
Since 1982, longer cycles have become the new normal.
Why is this?
Optimists would say that less frequent recessions are a result of positive structural shifts and better policy choices that have made the US economy less prone to downturns.
A January Goldman Sachs research paper points to better inventory and supply chain management （much of it the result of technological improvements） and the declining share of the US economy that is linked to more cyclical sectors, thanks partly to offshoring of manufacturing.
At the same time, the growth of the US shale industry has reduced the risk and impact of oil price shocks, once a major recession trigger.
Other explanations of the lengthening economic cycle highlight the ways the world economy has evolved.
Technological advances and globalisation, particularly China’s reintegration into the market system and higher levels of cross-border trade, have increased productivity and growth while dampening inflation.
Meanwhile, the end of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system gave US central bankers more freedom to extend economic cycles, because they no longer had to worry about maintaining a fixed relationship between gold and the dollar.
The result was fewer recessions but also a rise in both public and private debt, as governments worldwide were able to fund more deficit spending, and companies took advantage of low rates set by central bankers who could be less focused on price stability, once Paul Volcker tamed inflation in the 1980s.
Debt has papered over myriad problems in the US economy in recent years, from rising inequality to stagnant wages.
It also helps mediate squabbles between various political interest groups.
Both Republicans and Democrats have largely embraced a “markets know best” approach since the 1980s because it allowed them to avoid making unpopular choices about dividing up the national wealth pie.
Why choose between guns and butter when you could simply deregulate markets, unleash the financial sector, and hope rising asset prices would let you turn the other way?
All this begs the question of whether longer really is better when it comes to business cycles.
Recessions are a natural and normal part of capitalism, not something to be avoided at all costs.
Indeed, the Deutsche Bank economists argue that productivity would be higher and American entrepreneurial zeal stronger if the US business cycle had not been artificially prolonged by monetary policy.
But the longer the period of expansion, the harder it is to take away the punch bowl.
I agree that policymakers did have to intervene after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers to avoid a bigger downturn — the human costs were already too high.
But I also do not believe, as some optimists do, that “this time is different”.
Long periods of expansion invariably result in too much leverage, followed by a correction, and usually a recession.
Non-financial corporate debt, which tends to rise until a recession hits, has exceeded prior peaks and gone from 35 per cent of US gross domestic product in 1985 to 46 per cent today.
Yet corporate bond default rates have been at very low levels for a decade and a half.
I worry about what will happen when investors and traders put those two facts together and start pricing in a rise in defaults.
It makes me wish that perhaps US policymakers had opted for smaller, more frequent doses of pain rather than brewing up history’s longest expansion.
The White House wants to keep the music playing at least through the 2020 election.
President Donald Trump this week blasted the European Central Bank head Mario Draghi on Twitter for “unfairly” promising “more stimulus” and then hinted he might demote Fed chair Jay Powell if he failed to do the same.
Mr Trump’s tirades remind me of my kids when I’ve let them stay up too late and eat too much ice cream.
Maybe a tech productivity surge will eventually come along and turn this market-driven recovery cycle into something that spreads prosperity more widely.
More likely there will be hell to pay for leaving the lights on too long.

Vietnam's economy expanded faster than expected in the second quarter of this year, as the country reaps the benefits of the ongoing trade war between China and the US.
Gross domestic product rose 6.71 per cent year on year in the second quarter of 2019, only slightly down from a revised 6.82 per cent in the first quarter, according to Vietnam's General Statistics Office.
A poll of economists by Bloomberg had forecast a drop to 6.61 per cent growth.
The GSO said processing and manufacturing, which covers goods exporters, was the fastest growing sector, posting a 9.14 per cent rise.
Services output rose 6.85 per cent, against 2.19 per cent for agriculture.
Vietnam has been one of the  biggest beneficiaries in Asia from the ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies, as manufacturers have moved production from China to the Southeast Asian country to avoid tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.
Imports from Vietnam to the US surged nearly 40 per cent year on year in the first four months of 2019, according to Financial Times calculations, while imports from China over the same period fell 13 per cent.
The Asian Development Bank has estimated that Vietnam will gain up to a cumulative 2 per cent of GDP over three years if trade ructions escalate further.
Vietnam's gains stand in contrast to other Asean countries which have been hit hard by the knock-on effects of the ongoing dispute, with Singapore and Malaysia suffering particularly steep falls in exports. Data released last week showed Singapore's  non-oil exports falling by the most in three years.

Markets seem convinced that the US Federal Reserve is going to cut interest rates next month.
The only questions investors are now debating is to what extent the central bank will trim rates in July — and how low it will ultimately go.
Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs chief economist who long defied consensus by predicting the Fed would keep rates on hold, has now pencilled in two cuts for 2019 on the basis of hints from chairman Jay Powell and his fellow rate-setters.
Meanwhile, the Fed Funds futures market, which allows traders to bet on the direction of US interest rates, is pricing in three quarter-point cuts by the end of the year, beginning in July.
Positioning in eurodollar futures, another popular contract for US rate wagers, is now at its highest levels since the peak of the European crisis in 2012, implying a strong conviction that easier monetary policy is just around the corner.
“I just don’t see the case for rate cuts, but [the June Fed meeting] was the most dovish outcome we could have had [without] an actual rate cut,” said Gregory Peters, a senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income. “Markets are bullying the Fed, and the Fed is responding.”
This raises a series of thorny questions.
What would happen if policymakers refrain from cutting interest rates?
If the Fed does cut, will it do so by the customary quarter point, or a more decisive half a percentage point?
And assuming the central bank does trim rates, will this be a precautionary move to bolster growth at a time of passing weakness, or will it solidify concerns over the slowing economy, leading markets into browbeating the Fed into a full rate-cutting cycle?
Not everyone is convinced lower rates are a done deal.
Sceptics note that while economic data have softened over the past year and that resurgent trade tensions have cast a pall over the global economy, there is little to truly alarm officials at the Fed.
Unemployment is at a half-century low, and interest rates — in a target range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent — are only barely higher than the main US rate of inflation.
Assuming that these figures do not deteriorate markedly, it is plausible that the Fed decides against trimming rates next month.
More than half of Fed policymakers still forecast no cuts in 2019, and most of the doves are non-voters this year.
Richard Clarida, Fed vice-chairman, has previously stressed that the central bank “can’t be handcuffed” by markets.
However, the Fed does appear to have painted itself into a corner.
Given the rock-solid confidence that looser policy is now coming, markets could suffer a severe shock — similar to the turmoil witnessed last December — if the central bank does hold fire.
“There would be a lot of volatility,” warned Nancy Davis, chief investment officer at Connecticut-based firm Quadratic Capital Management. “The market has gone over its skis in pricing in rate cuts.”
The central bank itself appears to have been building a case for what economists have termed “insurance” rate cuts, to tide over a period of uncertainty.
Back in April, Mr Clarida pointed out that the central bank lowered rates in 1995 and 1998, even though there was no recession on the horizon.
This was the rationale of James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, for voting for a rate cut in June to “provide insurance against further declines in expected inflation and a slowing economy subject to elevated downside risks”.
Mr Powell may have voted to keep rates steady, but he also seems receptive to the argument.
“An ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure,” he said at a press conference.
The question then becomes whether the Fed opts for a forceful half-point rate cut, as a number of investors and economists now expect.
Financial markets indicate that would be only the start, with at least a full percentage point of rate cuts priced in over the next year or so.
Encouragingly for the Fed, interest rate futures indicate that traders think this will be enough to buttress the economy, leading to renewed rate increases from 2021, according to Morgan Stanley.
The blitheness of the US stock market, which hit a record intraday high on Friday, indicates that equity investors also think the Fed will manage to forestall a recession.
However, it will be a fine line to tread, between giving the markets the rate cuts they crave and spooking them, through sending out too-gloomy signals on the global economy.
The margin for error is thin, warned Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Wealth Management.
“Since 2009, the Fed has proven generally successful at pivoting the right way, but we are wary of positioning for perfection,” he said.

Have you ever paid to take an online course, or even started one with the support of your employer, and failed to get to the end?
If so, you are in good company.
The careers of the future, it is often said, will be built on constant learning.
The requirements for many jobs change too quickly for workers to sit back on what they were taught at university, and demand constant skills renewal.
Also, most forms of employment are no longer for life: navigating the labour market at frequent intervals requires the ability to demonstrate the latest marketable skills.
But the new forms of education that are being developed to deal with these needs often fail their customers.
In the online learning world, success rates are low and most people give up before they get to the end of even relatively short courses that are meant to teach them new skills.
Sebastian Thrun has seen this play out from different perspectives.
A pioneer of the so-called Mooc movement early this decade, he was one of the first to champion the “massive open online courses” that at one time seemed like they might disrupt higher education by making lectures and course material freely available online.
Since then, he has gone on to devise other forms of online education.
The twists and turns his company, Udacity, has been through offer a good perspective on the ongoing efforts to design the most effective way to supplement workers’ skills as they progress through their careers.
The internet has made it easy to access educational material, but it hasn’t solved some of the perennial problems faced by people who study alone.
A former professor of artificial intelligence at Stanford University in Silicon Valley, Mr Thrun moved to Google to start the internet company’s driverless car programme and became the first head of X, the research labs where Google nurtures its “moon shot” projects.
He left eight years ago to start Udacity, which was set up to pursue the Mooc concept.
But after such courses failed to live up to their idealistic origins the company switched to selling online courses designed to teach existing workers new skills, either to help them get a new job or earn a promotion.
Only about 5 per cent of people who enrol on Moocs complete them, says Mr Thrun.
By comparison, Udacity claims a 34 per cent “graduation” rate on its so-called “nanodegrees” — short, part-time courses lasting several months that are designed to teach workers a practical new skill.
The company focuses on technology, partly reflecting its base in Silicon Valley and Thrun’s own background （one popular new course introduced last year involves driverless cars）.
It also stems from a belief, he says, that digital transformation is forcing many non-technical people in the business world to learn new ways to cope with how their jobs are changing.
New technologies such as artificial intelligence are also sweeping through business, exposing a severe shortage of technical skills. “Every CEO knows [AI] exists,” Mr Thrun says. “The field is moving so insanely fast that no one can keep up.” Skill shortages mean few companies can hire the experts they need to make use of the technology: the only practical answer is to retrain existing staff.
While Thrun says Udacity’s graduation rate is at the high end for online courses, it still reveals a sobering reality: about two-thirds of people never get to the end.
So why do so many people fail to complete online courses?
There is one reason above all, says Mr Thrun: solitary learning is hard.
Many people run into “an insurmountable technical challenge” they cannot get past.
Without the kind of personal attention that comes from more traditional forms of training, they become demoralised and give up.
As it tried to find the right formula, Udacity added a social element to its learning to try to reduce the sense of isolation.
“The interpersonal aspects of learning are incredibly important,” says Mr Thrun.
Students are put into groups with regular meeting schedules.
Much depends on getting the social dynamics right so people feel safe.
“Engaging in education makes you very vulnerable,” he says.
This course correction was not enough, however, and Udacity is changing direction again — a move that has involved laying off many of its workers.
It had spent heavily on online content with very high production values in an effort to engage customers, but that led to ballooning expenses: a single course would cost $1m to develop without significantly boosting success rates.
Thrun, who had stepped down from day-to-day operations in 2012 （his latest project: building a flying car for Google co-founder Larry Page）, returned in October and content costs have been slashed.
The company’s latest attempt to solve the online learning conundrum has been to add technical mentors.
These advise and cajole customers to get them through the hard times and complete courses.
The increased human involvement also includes giving students more feedback on real-world projects they are expected to complete for their courses.
This kind of personal supervision has been shown to get success rates up to 60 per cent or more, Udacity’s co-founder says.
The right kind of support from a customer’s employer is equally important.
Explicit recognition from the top is one thing that can make a difference: when chief executives show personal interest in the cause of educating their workers it has a big impact, he says.
Even more important, he adds, is getting the buy-in of a student’s direct manager.
He describes this as the biggest single factor in determining whether a worker goes on to complete a course of study.
Managers who only pay lip service to the cause of learning are unlikely to get the same results.
So how important are new skills when set alongside the on-the-job experience that many workers see as their main selling point when looking for a new role?
According to Mr Thrun, experience is not all it is cracked up to be.
He says that, faced with the choice between two workers with the same level of skills, one of whom is older and more experienced, many companies these days will pick the younger, less experienced candidate.
The thinking is that younger workers are not held back by knowledge of the way things have been done in the past, making them less limited in their responses.
That might sound like a typical Silicon Valley perspective on work, where loyalty to old ideas is seen as a hindrance.
But as more areas of the business world are exposed to disruptive digital forces, it is an outlook that is likely to spread.

Donald Trump likes to claim that the US is always winning.
But when it comes to the business of dealmaking, there is no dispute.
The record-breaking boom in global mergers and acquisitions has extended into the first half of 2019, yet unlike the past five years, bankers in Europe and Asia have been left as envious observers while the US takes a dominant role.
Ambitious deals by large companies ranging from drugmaker AbbVie to defence contractor  United Technologies, to oil group  Occidental Petroleum, have driven US activity.
Buoyant stock markets and cheap financing in the debt markets have helped oil the wheels of a record first half in which $1.1tn worth of US corporate takeovers have been struck.
The volume of deals, up almost a fifth from a year ago, accounts for more than half of the activity this year, according to data provider Refinitiv.
America’s share of the global takeover pie has not been this big since before the dotcom boom and bust.
The striking concentration of M&A within US borders — at the expense of cross-border deals — was in part a consequence of the Trump administration’s more protectionist approach, including its trade war against China, multiple top M&A advisers told the Financial Times.
“We are heading into a more mercantile world, with protectionism [and] the trade dispute with China,” said Mark Shafir, the co-head of global M&A at Citigroup. “It is logical the transactions you see are more local in nature. It is not the most hospitable environment for cross-border deals.”
Although the level of global dealmaking in the first half was still the third-highest on record, the $2tn total was down 13 per cent from last year and included a sharp slowdown outside the US.
European transactions tumbled 57 per cent to $287bn, marking the weakest first half in six years.
Activity in Japan dropped 23 per cent to $38bn, with the value of deals in the rest of Asia Pacific coming in at $342bn, down 28 per cent from the first half of 2018.
Africa and the Middle East was the only region outside the Americas to see a pick-up in activity.
A single $69bn deal engineered by Saudi Arabia to bolster the prospects of its state oil company Saudi Aramco was chiefly responsible, underlining the outsized impact large deals can have.
Across the world, companies are increasingly steering away from deals that are likely to face scrutiny from newly emboldened national security panels that last year blocked several high profile transactions.
Less than a quarter of the $2tn worth of deals struck this year have been cross border, the lowest level in more than two decades.
By contrast, the 10 largest transactions have all been between companies located within the same country.
The US has accounted for eight of them.
The trend has been a boon for American investment banks, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America all gaining market share over Asian and European rivals, the Refinitiv data showed.
Deutsche Bank, Barclays and UBS all saw their share of M&A fall in the first half of the year, with Deutsche failing to make the top 10 merger advisers as boutiques like Evercore and PJT Partners muscled in.
If Trump has cast a shadow over global dealmaking, the US administration faces a different test of its enthusiasm for blockbuster deals when the justice department rules on the merger of wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile.
Approval of the deal, M&A advisers say, will send a signal that competition authorities in the US are willing to wave through deals over fierce competition concerns.
A green light for the Sprint-T-Mobile combination would stand in contrast to outcomes in the UK and across continental Europe, where regulators have blocked several deals in the first half.
UK supermarket chain J Sainsbury’s  planned £7.3bn takeover of its Walmart-owned rival, Asda, was blocked, while a proposed tie-up of the train manufacturing arms of Germany’s Siemens and France’s Alstom  was scuppered by Brussels.
“The number-one question we get asked is will my deal even get approved?” says Hernan Cristerna, global co-head of M&A at JPMorgan Chase.
“If the trend of North American companies announcing most of the largest deals so far this year continues, European companies will need to react, including creating European champions to challenge an ‘America First’ policy and the threat of an expansionist China strategy,” he added.
Efforts to kick-start dealmaking in Europe have run into roadblocks.
An  attempted €33bn tie-up between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France’s Renault that would have created the third-largest automaker, was abandoned after FCA’s chairman grew frustrated with delays from the board of the French carmaker.
A long hoped for merger between Deutsche Bank and its domestic rival Commerzbank  collapsed after weeks of talks, with the two German lenders warning there were too many hurdles to justify such a complex deal.
And one of the biggest attempted leveraged buyouts of a German company unravelled in May, after shareholders  blocked the takeover of Scout24 by Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone on concerns over the price.
Cathal Deasy, head of European M&A at Credit Suisse, said: “When you look at $10bn or less, the activity in Europe is healthy. But the big cross-border European deals over that size just are not there. If you look at cross-border M&A over the past few years, it’s been dominated by inbound deals into the region by Japanese and US buyers. They just are not there right now.”
A pick-up in activist hedge funds targeting Europe has been one impetus for deals in the region, as companies pursue simplification plans to either address or head off attacks.
In Germany,  Siemens and  Volkswagen both announced plans to hive off large units of their business, while in Switzerland, Novartis did the same.
Nestlé sold its skin health business to private equity group EQT for  over $10bn.
The deglobalisation of dealmaking has played out in Asia, too, as activity within the region has increased.
M&A between countries, including Japan and Australia has remained solid, helped by Nippon Paint’s $2.7bn buyout out of DuluxGroup in April.
Japanese companies have also been active across south-east Asia.
“One segment of Asia Pacific M&A activity that’s up is in-region cross-border M&A, while Asia outbound activity has been impacted by a heightened level of cautiousness,” said Tom Barsha, co-head of Asia Pacific M&A at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Having led Asian M&A as recently as 2016, the overseas ambitions of Chinese companies have been blunted.
The trade war, increasing scrutiny of Chinese technology deals in the US and tougher financing conditions at home have all been headwinds.
“Many Chinese corporations are being very cautious and the credit lines have not been as strong,” said Philip Li, a partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in Hong Kong.

Vladimir Putin has trumpeted the growth of national populist movements in Europe and America, crowing that liberalism is spent as an ideological force.
In an FT interview in the Kremlin on the eve of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, the Russian president said “the liberal idea” had “outlived its purpose” as the public turned against immigration, open borders and multiculturalism.
Mr Putin’s evisceration of liberalism — the dominant western ideology since the end of the second world war in 1945 — chimes with anti-establishment leaders from US president Donald Trump to Hungary’s Viktor Orban, Matteo Salvini in Italy, and the Brexit insurgency in the UK.
“[Liberals] cannot simply dictate anything to anyone just like they have been attempting to do over the recent decades,” he said.
Mr Putin branded Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to admit more than 1m refugees to Germany, mainly from war-ravaged Syria, as a “cardinal mistake”.
But he praised Donald Trump for trying to stop the flow of migrants and drugs from Mexico.
“This liberal idea presupposes that nothing needs to be done. That migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants have to be protected.”
He added: “Every crime must have its punishment. The liberal idea has become obsolete. It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population.”
As the de facto ruler of Russia for almost two decades, Mr Putin, 66, has been regularly accused of covertly supporting populist movements through financial aid and social media, notably in the 2016 US presidential election, the Brexit referendum and the recent European Parliament elections.
Mr Putin emphatically denied this.
He dismissed the conclusion by special prosecutor Robert Mueller that Russia had systemically interfered in the 2016 US presidential election as “mythical interference”.
Turning to the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Gulf between the US and Iran, Mr Putin said the situation had become “explosive”.
The problem, he said, stemmed from American unilateralism and the lack of rules underpinning world order.
He expressed concern about the threat of a renewed nuclear arms race between the US and Russia.
“The cold war was a bad thing . . . but there were at least some rules that all participants in international communication more or less adhered to or tried to follow. Now, it seems that there are no rules at all,” he said.
On a positive note, Mr Putin said there were tentative signs of a thaw in Anglo-Russian relations ahead of his meeting in Osaka with Theresa May, her farewell summit as UK prime minister.
“I think Russia and UK are both interested in fully restoring our relations, at least I hope a few preliminary steps will be made.”
Relations between London and Moscow have been frozen after the attempted assassination of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England.
The UK government blames the Russian government for the nerve agent attack, but Mr Putin said there was no evidence to support this.
Mr Skripal had served a sentence in Russia before being released in a spy swap with the UK, he noted.
Mr Putin made clear, however, that he had zero tolerance for spies who betrayed their country.
“Treason is the gravest crime possible and traitors must be punished. I am not saying that the Salisbury incident is the way to do it . . . but traitors must be punished.”
In recent years, Mr Putin has become emboldened, presiding over the annexation of Crimea, a pro-Russian revolt in eastern Ukraine and a military intervention in Syria which he described as a clear-cut success.
Apart from killing thousands of radical Islamists and shoring up President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, Mr Putin said the exercise had given Russia’s armed forces invaluable fighting experience.
He made no mention of the fact the seven-year-old war has resulted in more than 5m refugees and 500,000 dead.
However, he did point to the waves of immigration from conflict zones in Africa and the Middle East which had fostered crime and social strains, in turn fuelling an anti-establishment backlash in Europe.
Echoing nationalist populists such as Mr Salvini and France’s Marine Le Pen, Mr Putin said liberal governments had not acted to reassure citizens.
Instead they had pursued a mindless multiculturalism embracing, among other things, sexual diversity.
“I am not trying to insult anyone because we have been condemned for our alleged homophobia. But we have no problem with LGBT persons. God forbid, let them live as they wish,” he said. “But some things do appear excessive to us. They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles.”
“Let everyone be happy, we have no problem with that,” he added. “But this must not be allowed to overshadow the culture, traditions and traditional family values of millions of people making up the core population.”

Europe is in meltdown.
A heatwave spread across the continent this week, thermometers soared past 40C as temperatures broke new records.
Schools close to Paris were forced to close; Germany introduced speed restrictions on its autobahns; and a Spanish meteorologist tweeted a map of the country’s weather forecast with the caption: “Hell is coming.”
Temperatures are likewise running high in the climate change debate ahead of the G20 meeting in Osaka.
Japan is set to omit references to “global warming” and “decarbonisation” from a G20 communiqué in a bid to please the US.
This comes just days after four central European states — Estonia, Czech Republic, Poland and Bulgaria— stopped the EU from committing to a 2050 net zero carbon emissions target last week.
Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, is helping to prevent publication of a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Last week Republican senators in Oregon fled the state to block the passage of a landmark bill that would commit the state, like neighbouring California, to ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. School strikes by teenagers and direct action, such as that by Extinction Rebellion, who demand governments “tell the truth”, have become a regular occurrence in recent months. At the same time, so have protests by France’s gilets jaunes, who oppose increases in fuel taxes.
International progress on fighting climate change is in danger of stalling.
Yet bold and decisive leadership is needed if temperatures are to be prevented from rising to catastrophic levels.
Countries that depend on fossil fuels will ultimately face a choice between foot-dragging or being left behind by technological progress.
Renewables are often beating traditional sources on cost as well as on carbon emissions.
Blocking international agreements will not keep coal viable.
Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, is rightly making a stand.
He has pledged to refuse to sign any G20 communiqué that leaves out a reference to the 2015 Paris agreement on combating climate change.
Bottom-up pressure seems to be working where top-down international conferences stumble.
Green parties were big gainers in last months’ European Parliament elections.
France and Britain are pushing ahead on their own with net zero targets; Bavaria, a German state not usually known for its radicalism, is going further than the national government to end the use of coal.
In the US, city mayors and state governments are stepping in to compensate for the lack of federal government action.
Britain, France and California are all relatively large economies but ultimately tackling climate change will depend on action by the largest emitters — China, the US, India and the EU.
That makes global co-operation essential even if a few holdouts have blocked progress since the Paris accord.
Governments will need to step up to meet even the Paris targets in coming years.
That will mean levelling with companies, workers and taxpayers about the costs.
Spain’s programme to phase out coal, which involved early retirement for miners and payments to coal-dependent regions, provides one model for a so-called “just transition” which spreads costs fairly.
Frustrating international agreements can do nothing but delay the inevitable.
The reality of climate change will catch up with politicians.
That may be in the form of angry voters on the streets, or of extreme weather that makes cities uninhabitable and crops fail.
As fugitive Oregon senators and G20 leaders in Osaka will eventually find, running away is not an option.

Donald Trump has angered US security hawks by softening his stance on Chinese telecoms company Huawei — a concession even Beijing had not expected to win as part of a trade truce with President Xi Jinping at the G20.
As part of the trade compromise brokered on Saturday in Osaka, the US president agreed not to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods and China agreed to buy US agricultural produce.
In a less expected twist, Mr Trump also agreed to reverse a decision that had in effect imposed a ban on American groups to sell software and equipment to Huawei.
Mr Trump first said he told Mr Xi he would only consider addressing Huawei issues at the “very end” of the trade talks.
But on Sunday he revealed he reversed his position on the sale of gear to Huawei “at the request of our high tech companies and President Xi”.
“Trump gave the Chinese a clear sense that he is transactional on China rather than ideological — which they take as good news,” said Dennis Wilder, former head of China analysis at the CIA.
“National security hawks are unhappy and will try to block his Huawei move in Congress.”
Senator Marco Rubio, who supports a hard line on China, said Congress would have to respond: “If President Trump has agreed to reverse recent sanctions against #Huawei he has made a catastrophic mistake,” he tweeted.
When Mr Trump earlier this year suggested he would consider including Huawei in any trade deal, it sparked criticism from those arguing the company posed a security threat.
They feared the president would overlook their concerns to meet his campaign pledge about reducing the US trade deficit with China.
From China’s perspective, the meeting went better than expected, in line with Mr Xi’s other encounters with Mr Trump, whose appetite for fighting wanes when in the same room as his Chinese counterpart.
Before the gathering of world leaders, Beijing was confident that he would not impose new tariffs on Chinese exports and that he would agree to a resumption of trade talks in return for token purchases of US agricultural goods.
But Chinese officials and analysts did not expect any narrowing of the trade differences or a softening on Huawei and merely sought to halt the downward spiral in relations, people familiar with China’s preparations said.
A resumption of trade talks is “probably the best outcome we can expect,” Shi Yinhong of Renmin University had said before the G20.
So Mr Trump’s offer to ease the pressure on Huawei and his comment that the nations could become “strategic partners” came as a surprise.
Illustrating the general disbelief in China, Huawei tweeted “U-turn?” on Saturday.
Asked by the Financial Times if he planned to remove Huawei from the “entity list” — which dictates which US companies get licences to export to Chinese companies on the list — Mr Trump said it was under discussion. One official said the administration was also looking at other ways to enact the change.
Larry Kudlow, a senior White House economic adviser, said on Sunday the change in tack was not a “general amnesty” for Huawei.
“All that’s going to happen is the Commerce Department will grant some temporary additional licences where there’s a general availability,” he told Fox News.
“For example, some of the chipmakers in the United States are selling products that are frankly widely available from other countries.”
However, Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, pointed out that Mr Trump had also shifted his stance on ZTE, another Chinese telecoms group, in 2017 after a request from Mr Xi.
“Trump saved ZTE when he had a stranglehold on it, so no one should be surprised,” Ms Glaser said of the latest presidential reversal on Huawei.
“Trump obviously views Huawei has a bargaining chip. He has said repeatedly that Huawei could be part of a deal.”

The head of Anheuser-Busch InBev is betting that a planned public listing in Asia will help the world’s largest brewer expand in the fast-growing region via acquisitions.
The company has been meeting investors since mid-June to gauge demand for the  initial public offering  of Budweiser APAC in Hong Kong, according to people familiar with the process, and will decide whether to press ahead in July, depending on price and market conditions.
Asked about the listing at a press event in Belgium, AB InBev chief executive Carlos Brito likened the potential sale of a minority stake in its Asian business to how the company used AmBev, its Brazilian listed subsidiary, to help convince owners of beer companies in Latin America to sell to AB InBev over the past 20 years.
“The number one reason to do the listing is to have a platform in the region that is seen as closer to those markets and connected to what the region will do, since that’s something that can be attractive to local groups,” he told the Financial Times.
Sellers feel “more comfortable” joining forces with and being paid in shares of a local entity, rather than a global one.
“That’s what we saw in Latin America, so we’re betting that the same model could work in Asia,” said Mr Brito, who has led the maker of Bud Light and Stella Artois for nearly 15 years.
Backed by the Brazilian billionaires behind 3G Capital, Mr Brito’s AB InBev used cheap debt to  consolidate the fragmented global brewing industry and perfected a model of ruthless cost-cutting to rapidly boost margins at the acquired businesses.
Its most recent large deal, the £79bn acquisition of SABMiller, left it highly leveraged, carrying $102.5bn in debt at the end of 2018, giving it a net debt-to-ebitda ratio of 4.6 times.
If AB InBev pushes ahead with the Asia IPO, it could raise $5bn to $10bn that will be used to cut debt, analysts said.
Although JPMorgan, one of the lead banks on the IPO, has valued the Asia unit at $63bn to $77bn, Jefferies and Bernstein Research, which are not involved in the process, reckon it is worth $45bn to $55bn.
Budweiser APAC includes a fast-growing business in China, as well as a more mature, profitable one in Australia and Korea.
The latter generated almost two-thirds of last year’s revenue of $8.5bn and just over half of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of $2.8bn, according to the IPO filing.
But China is expected to be the main growth driver as the burgeoning middle class trades up from local brews to foreign ones like Budweiser, which are positioned as premium brands.

Donald Trump said he had “a lot of time” to deal with Iran at the start of the G20 summit in Osaka on Friday, as the meeting of the world’s largest economies began under the shadow of Washington’s rising tensions with Tehran and the unresolved US-China trade war.
“We have a lot of time. There’s no rush, they can take their time,” the US president said, even as he warned that there would be consequences if there was no resolution to the escalating crisis in the Gulf.
“There is absolutely no time pressure. Hopefully in the end it’s going to work out. If it does, great, if it doesn’t, you‘ll be hearing about it.”
Donald Tusk, the European Council president, noted the EU’s “serious concern” about the tensions and said he would be telling all sides to show “maximum restraint”.
He “strongly urged” Iran to continue to uphold the nuclear agreement, warning the EU would “take seriously” any breach of its commitments.
Mr Trump is expected to discuss the Iran crisis in bilateral meetings with the leaders of Russia, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Russia and others attending the two-day summit.
While the G20 leaders will hold numerous bilateral meetings, the focus remains squarely on the face-to-face meeting between Mr Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping on Saturday.
The two leaders will try to make progress towards an agreement aimed at ending the trade war between the economic powers after talks collapsed last month.
Speaking before a session on trade, Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, said discontent about the changes brought in by globalisation had sparked “sharp confrontation between states”.
But he said it was important that any trade measures adopted by countries should be consistent with World Trade Organization rules.
“I harbour great concern about the current situation on global trade,” Mr Abe said. “The world is watching the direction at which we the G20 leaders are [proceeding]. Now is the time we communicate a strong message for the maintenance and strengthening of a free, fair and non-discriminatory trading system.”

A Kenyan court has halted construction of the country’s first coal-fired power station on environmental grounds in a blow for the $2bn project’s Chinese backers and the green credentials of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
Owned by the Kenya-based Amu Power and funded with export credit from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the contentious project has sparked a heated debate in Kenya about the potential impact of coal-based power on the country’s ecosystem.
Located on Kenya’s Indian Ocean coast approximately 14 miles north of Lamu town, a tourist destination and Unesco World Heritage site, environmentalists say the plant will pollute the air and destroy mangroves and the breeding grounds of endangered species.
The project’s backers say its planned capacity of 1,050MW will boost Kenya’s power output by almost 50 per cent and help address frequent blackouts while reducing costs for consumers.
The decision on Wednesday by the National Environment Tribunal to revoke the project’s environmental licence means Amu Power must complete a new environmental and social impact assessment before regulators will consider authorising construction.
The project’s existing licence, issued by the National Environment Management Authority, was invalid because Amu Power had failed to adequately consult the population when completing its first study, the judges said.
The Chinese government has made public commitments that infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, such as the Lamu power plant, would be designed to limit their environmental impact, but critics say there is little evidence that such policies are implemented at the project level.
Environment activists described the Kenyan court ruling as an important victory but promised to fight on to prevent the project from ever breaking ground.
“It is not Lamu that will be poisoned alone, it’s the rest of Kenya, Africa and the Indian Ocean,” said Njeri Kabeberi, the executive director for Africa at campaigning organisation Greenpeace International.
Having both signed the Paris Climate agreement, it was shocking that Kenya and China were backing the project, Ms Njeri said.
Jinfeng Zhou, head of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, a Chinese NGO, said the ruling demonstrated that China must reduce the environmental impact of its planned investments and improve dialogue with local communities if the Belt and Road Initiative is to succeed.
“Only green development can [allow] the Belt and Road to develop in a more sustainable way,” Mr Zhou said.
“Dialogues and communication with local communities . . . are essential.”
The project was due to be built by the Power Construction Corporation of China and funded in part with $900m of export financing from ICBC.
The plant, which has been designated part of the Belt and Road Initiative by the Chinese government, would be the largest power plant in east Africa and “solve the power shortage for millions in the region”, according to the Chinese lender.
Representatives of Amu Power and ICBC could not immediately be reached for comment.

Donald Trump slammed Japan ahead of his arrival in Osaka for the G20, saying the US-Japan defence alliance was lopsided and Japan would watch “on a Sony television” instead of fighting if the US came under attack.
In an interview with Fox Business, the US president said the US was obliged under a decades-old mutual security treaty to defend Japan if the Asian nation came under attack, but that Japan had no reciprocal obligation.
“If Japan is attacked, we will fight World War III. We will go in and protect them with our lives and with our treasure,” Mr Trump said on Wednesday. “We will fight at all costs . . . but if we are attacked, Japan doesn’t have to help us at all. They can watch on a Sony television.”
Mr Trump also launched a broadside against the EU, lashing out at Brussels for its pursuit of US technology companies in a series of antitrust investigations.
The president said Margrethe Vestager, the EU antitrust commissioner, “hates” America as she announced launched an antitrust investigation against Broadcom, the US chipmaker.
Brussels believes the company is “likely to hold a dominant position” in supplying components for modems and television set-top boxes.
Broadcom said in a statement that “it complies with European competition rules and that the Commission’s concerns are without merit”.
Ms Vestager has won praise in Europe for her probes of Amazon, Google and Apple over allegedly abusing their market dominance or tax avoidance.
“She hates the United States perhaps worse than any person I’ve ever met,” Mr Trump said.
“What she does to our country. She’s suing all our companies. We should be suing Google and Facebook . . . They’re suing Apple. They’re suing everybody.”
Mr Trump has in the past frequently criticised Japan and South Korea, another key US ally in Asia, for not bearing more of the cost of hosting US troops in their respective countries.
But his latest comments will raise concerns in Tokyo as Mr Trump prepares to meet Shinzo Abe, Japanese prime minister, on Friday in Osaka.
During a visit to Japan earlier this month, Mr Trump declared that the US-Japan alliance “has never been stronger” but said Mr Abe was constantly trying to flatter him in an effort to ward off attacks about burden-sharing.

Watch enthusiast Li Yanzhe is among the 400m Chinese millennials tipped to become an even more dominant force in global luxury consumption in the coming years. Chinese consumers accounted for a third of all global luxury spending last year — a proportion expected to rise to 40 per cent by 2025, according to McKinsey, a consultancy.
European and US brands have dominated China’s luxury market until now.
Yet Mr Li’s peer group — which accounts for two-thirds of all luxury spending in China — is opening up to domestic names, creating fresh opportunity for quality homegrown watchmakers.
Annie Hou, vice-president of strategy at marketing agency Ogilvy in Beijing, is among those noticing changes in consumer attitudes.
Millennials express themselves and shape their personal image through luxury goods, she says, and they are starting to open up to Chinese brands.
“In their mind, domestic brands are no longer inferior to global brands,” she observes.
One reason behind the shift is that China’s economic rise over the past decade has fuelled a sense of national pride among its youth. “[The] post-90s [generation] grew up in an age when China had double-digit growth and rising global influence and reputation,” Ogilvy’s 2019 luxury report states. “They are much more proud to be Chinese and for many of them, Chinese [luxury] brands are as good as or even better than foreign brands in some categories.”
Despite this, 30-year-old Mr Li says he is reluctant to divert any of his Rmb100,000 （$14,850） annual watch budget to local dial names.
He says he struggles to connect with local watch brands as they lack a compelling narrative and craftsmanship.
“When Chinese brands make mechanical watches, they don’t have a core competitiveness such as the workmanship,” says Mr Li.
“And in terms of trends, they’re not really on the pulse . . . so these two elements are both done badly.”
Appealing to Chinese millennials is critical for all watchmakers: China’s retail market for watches was worth $11.4bn last year, up 10 per cent from 2017, figures from Euromonitor International show.
A sizeable chunk of this stems from Swiss luxury watches: mainland China was the third-largest export market for Swiss timepieces in 2018 at SFr1.72bn （$1.7bn）, behind Hong Kong and the US.
“International brands [marketed as] more premium are outperforming domestic ones,” says Stephanie Yao, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International. She cites clever tactics such as Omega’s release last year of a limited edition Speedmaster featuring Ultraman, a Japanese cartoon character from the 1980s and 1990s that was popular in China, as well as global brands’ push to reach Chinese customers through local social media platforms such as WeChat.
China’s swath of manufacturers-turned-brand owners, on the other hand, are held back by poor marketing strategies, believes Carson Chan, a watch expert and collector, meaning that a homegrown, high-end brand has yet to break through.
“You do have quite a few Chinese brands and they do have quality products, but unfortunately I don’t see any of them [adopting international brands’ approach to] marketing,” he says. “It seems to me all the marketing that they’re doing is saying: ‘Look, I can do it for half the price’.”
State-owned factories such as Shanghai Watch Factory started making watches in China from the 1950s.
The company made a shortlived bid for the luxury market in 2007, revamping its branding and bringing in Swiss designer Eric Giroud for two designs.
But, says Mr Chan, the plan stalled and its focus returned to manufacturing.
While Swiss brands dominate China’s high-end market, in the mid-range — which covers pieces from $500 to $3,000 — manufacturers from Europe, North America and south-east Asia battle for market share, a 2018 report by the Hong Kong Trade and Development Council found.
Yet China is making moves to shift the balance: according to the country’s 13th five-year plan, the HKTDC report states, it plans to shrink the proportion of watches classed as “low-end own brands” by 2020 to beef up the mid and high-end tiers.
This would raise the proportion in the luxury segment from 1 per cent of the total to 3 per cent.
Chinese brands Rossini and Ebohr — both owned by the Hong Kong-listed group Citychamp Watch and Jewellery — rank first and third on sales, according to René Weber, luxury goods analyst at Swiss bank Vontobel.
Shenzhen-based Fiyta is sandwiched in second place.
These brands accounted for less that 4 per cent of China’s overall watch market last year.
The three brands’ watches sell for between Rmb1,500 and Rmb3,000 （$220-$440） — roughly the price of a Tissot — and they compete with the likes of Fossil and Japanese brands Citizen, Seiko and Casio, Mr Weber says.
The comparatively short histories of Chinese watchmakers make it tough to compete with the dominant Swiss brands, he says, who market heavily around notions of heritage.
“If you look to the Swiss watch brands in the top 20, all of them have 100 years at least of history,” Mr Weber says.
Yet Fiyta does, at least, has a captivating story to its name. It has provided watches for China’s astronauts since 2003 and one of its timepieces, the Fiyta Spacemaster, was worn for the nation’s first spacewalk in 2008.
Beyond a lack of heritage, perceptions around craftsmanship can also dog the appeal of Chinese dial names.
Philip Wong, director of the industry division for the Federation of Hong Kong Watch Trade & Industries, says that while Chinese manufacturers use the latest technology and can achieve “more or less” the same quality as their Swiss counterparts, the difference lies in the finish.
“The difference is the beauty of the polishing and the alignment of each gear,” Mr Wong says. “That’s where the watchmaker spends time to make sure they’re running in perfect condition. And that’s the add-on value Swiss watchmakers are able to put in.” This presents a Catch-22: low demand for Chinese brands means manufacturers have little incentive to raise their game.
Yet William Shum, founder of Memorigin, a Hong Kong luxury watch brand, is trying to improve the view of Asian watchmaking.
Memorigin uses only Chinese tourbillons — a mechanism that compensates for the effects of gravity — which he says appeals to collectors who want something different.
He feels that his customers — of which about 15 per cent are from mainland China — are attracted by the quality-to-price ratio.
To compete with Europe’s dominant brands, Mr Shum is creating what he feels are distinctive designs that can help break China’s reputation of cheap copycats.
“By doing that, still there’s a chance for a Chinese-made brand to survive in the market and have a chance to develop,” he adds.
Unless Mr Shum’s forecast comes to bear, Chinese watchmakers might struggle to convince the likes of Mr Li to award them a slice of his annual watch budget.

US secretary of state Mike Pompeo downplayed a trade spat with India in an attempt to salvage the rapidly deteriorating economic relationship between Washington and New Delhi.
Mr Pompeo said at a press conference in New Delhi on Wednesday that he was optimistic both sides could reset trade relations, but gave few details on whether any tangible progress had been made.
“Great friends are bound to have disagreements; the United States has been clear we seek greater market access and the removal of trade barriers in our economic relationship,” said Mr Pompeo, speaking alongside his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
“Today I addressed these differences in the spirit of friendship and I think that the two of us will be able to see a good outcome for each of our two countries,” he added.
The secretary of state is visiting India on a trip to the Indo-Pacific region ahead of the G20 summit in Osaka, where he is laying the groundwork for an expected meeting between US president Donald Trump and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi.
His visit comes at a critical time for Washington and New Delhi following a tit-for-tat trade battle that saw the US withdraw preferential trade privileges and India retaliate by imposing import tariffs on more than 20 US products, including walnuts, apples and lentils.
Mr Trump has lashed out at India’s protectionist policies, describing the country as a “very-high tariff nation”.
Analysts warn the tariff escalation threatens to undermine the deepening US-India relationship at a time when the two countries are working together to counter China’s growing ambition in the region.
New Delhi's new ecommerce and data localisation regulations have frustrated Washington, which has complained that the policies do not allow US companies access to a “level playing field”.
Despite more than a year of negotiations, both sides have struggled to reach a compromise.
Other irritants are the threat of US sanctions, which have forced India to stop purchasing oil from Iran, which supplies about 10 per cent of its oil.
Washington has also objected to New Delhi’s decision to purchase Russia’s S-400 air defence system, on the grounds that it would compromise the security of US fighter jets.
India, which has long valued its strategic autonomy, has bristled at the US demands to rebuff Iran and Russia, two longtime allies who have historically provided India with oil and military hardware.
Still, Mr Jaishankar, a veteran diplomat and former ambassador to the US, echoed Mr Pompeo’s upbeat tone.
“We are committed to making it easier to do business, to provide a level playing field and to grow with the world economy,” he said.
On Iran, Mr Jaishankar said “I think we will do what it is in our national interest, and again part of that strategic partnership is the ability of each country to comprehend and appreciate the national interest of the other.”
Analysts said the meeting was a positive development after months of turmoil.
“The relationship was in trouble and this was a meeting to take stock and find ways to reverse course,” said Samir Saran, of the Observer Research Foundation, a think-tank in New Delhi.
“The fact the meeting took place was itself an achievement, that itself demonstrates determination in both quarters to set things right,” he added.
Mr Pompeo will travel to Japan before accompanying Mr Trump on a visit to South Korea for a meeting with President Moon Jae-in.

President Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his attack on the US Federal Reserve, calling its monetary policy “insane” and saying Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, should take the helm instead.
Mr Trump, who has repeatedly called on the Fed to cut interest rates, said central bank chairman Jay Powell was doing a “bad job”.
“He has to lower interest rates for us to compete with China,” he said in an interview on Fox Business Network.
“If they devalue and we can’t, we are no longer on a level playing field.”
Mr Trump also said Mr Draghi — who he accused last week of currency manipulation— should be at the helm of US monetary policy — “instead of our Fed person”.
Mr Trump said he never suggested he would fire or demote Mr Powell, but reiterated that he reserved the right to do so.
The Fed last week held interest rates steady but signalled a willingness to cut them should weak growth and inflation persist.
However, Mr Trump has been relentless in his criticism of the bank, claiming its decision to raise rates in December and its failure to cut them last week are holding back economic growth.
Policymakers “blew it” he lashed out in a pair of tweets on Monday.
He has at various turns also called the Fed his “biggest threat” and said Fed policy was “very, very disruptive”.
Despite Mr Trump’s public attacks, Mr Powell insisted he would not be swayed by such short-term political pressures.
He said on Tuesday: “The Fed is insulated from short-term political pressures — what is often referred to as our ‘independence’. Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests.”
Mr Trump is scheduled to meet Xi Jinping, China’s president, on the sidelines of the G20 summit later this week, where the leaders will try to jump-start stalled talks over their ongoing trade dispute.
Mr Trump told Fox Business on Wednesday that he would consider additional tariffs — possibly at 10 per cent, not 25 per cent as previously threatened — if a deal was not reached, but said he believed China wanted to make a deal and hoped one would be reached to avoid further escalation.

Why have the US-China trade negotiations stalled — and what will Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping need to do to revive the talks when they meet in Japan this week?
The US administration’s current position reflects an internal division.
One faction wants to decouple the American economy from China; this group favours tariffs, barriers to cross-border investment, and uncertainties that would compel companies to break supply chains.
The other faction seeks to change China’s practices in order to boost US exports, protect intellectual property and technology, and counter discrimination against overseas investors; these actions would expand American economic ties with China.
To reconcile these conflicting aims, the compromise has been to make extraordinary demands — and rely on Mr Trump’s instincts to decide whether to do a deal.
The principal problem in the negotiation now is what America will do in return if China takes steps to open markets, buy goods, and secure US interests.
For now, Washington has insisted on retaining the tariffs it imposed until Beijing delivers on its promises.
US negotiators also want the right to reimpose tariffs whenever America chooses — and to prohibit Chinese retaliation.
When China’s politburo reviewed the prospective deal, it choked on the lack of mutual obligations.
The two sides also failed to agree on Beijing’s shopping list for buying US goods.
To China, the terms looked unequal, raising old ghosts from 19th-century diplomacy about foreigners treating them with a lack of dignity and respect.
Mr Trump’s decision to blacklist Huawei adds another obstacle.
The Chinese do not know whether Washington is seeking to destroy the telecoms equipment group by starving it of critical inputs, to block the company’s business in the US and elsewhere, or to use it as a bargaining chip.
Along with the rest of the world, China has observed that trade protectionism, like immigration and the wall on the border with Mexico, appears to be a core political issue for Mr Trump.
Those topics signal authenticity to his political base, so he needs to keep protectionism and hostility to immigrants in the news to show supporters he is true to his word — and different from other politicians.
（Mr Trump’s political image is also to avoid military action and to break with his predecessors on North Korea and Iran.
Mr Trump’s dealmaking is impulsive, based on his political assessment of the moment.
If financial markets tumble, he is likely to trim his demands or at least pull back from the brink.
If he is concerned about business complaints, consumer costs, and threats to the economy, he could well hold off on more tariff increases, while restarting talks.
And if he decides to close after more negotiations, he will trumpet any deal as the “greatest ever”, regardless of the terms.
The biggest weakness of this approach is that tariffs and even a trade deal will not address the full range of Sino-American differences — and opportunities.
That extensive docket requires persistent, in-depth interaction.
Under Mr Trump, other work streams with China have been consumed by the trade talks.
The full agenda must address limits on China’s use of state capitalism, its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, maritime and regional security, new technologies and human rights.
If Mr Trump decides he wants a trade agreement, he will also need a way of reviewing outcomes and adjusting for new needs.
Under Mr Xi, China has been planning a new long-term strategy toward the US, reflecting its perceptions of changed circumstances and likely futures.
Mr Trump’s behaviour accelerated that work.
While he toys with tariffs and tactics, the US is failing to work with allies to develop a similarly comprehensive approach.

China is buying Iranian oil in defiance of US sanctions and providing what Tehran hopes will be a financial lifeline for the country’s buckling economy.
Even as Beijing customs data show crude purchases from Iran are down month-on-month, China is still importing Tehran’s oil, despite US measures designed to cut exports to “zero”.
Last week the Chinese received their first delivery of an Iranian oil cargo since the Trump administration in May scrapped exemptions on Iranian sanctions.
TankerTrackers, which monitors flows of oil through satellite signals and imagery, said the tanker Salina — a Suezmax vessel capable of carrying around 1m barrels — had docked in Jianzhou Bay, near Qingdao, on June 20, unloading its cargo over the following two days.
Oil sales are a crucial part of Iran’s efforts to resist the “maximum pressure” campaign of financial sanctions launched by the US after it pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal last year.
This week, Washington imposed a new round of sanctions on the Islamic republic and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, its supreme leader.
“The latest turn of the sanctions screw will keep tensions simmering,” said Stephen Brennock at London-based broker PVM.
The deliveries of Iranian oil to China come as Beijing wrestles with Washington over trade, with the world’s two largest economies fighting over tariffs, access to each other’s markets and the role of the US in extending sanction threats to countries that deal with its enemies. The US has also sanctioned oil exports from Venezuela, which China has provided with billions of dollars in oil-backed loans.
Tehran has threatened to breach uranium stock limits imposed by the accord unless it receives compensatory economic benefits from the remaining deal signatories — China, Russia and European powers.
Beijing’s position has been closely watched because of its status as a big buyer of Iranian oil.
It is also important because European efforts to do business with Iran have been hobbled by companies’ reluctance to risk retribution from the US.
Iran’s crude and oil condensate exports, which peaked at 2.8m barrels a day in April 2018, fell to around 1m b/d between November last year and April 2019 even though big buyers of Iranian crude — such as China and India — were given sanctions exemptions.
After the removal of these waivers, energy consultancy FGE expects this figure to drop below 500,000 b/d this month.
China would account for about 200,000 b/d, it estimates.
A regime insider told the Financial Times that sanctions had caused a significant drop in Iranian oil sales, the lifeblood of the country’s economy, but the volume of exports was still far higher than revealed by public figures.
“We still have many ways to sell crude. One may be surprised to hear that we even sell crude to some European refineries by rerouting and at higher costs for us,” he said, without specifying any particular trades.
Iman Nasseri at FGE said: “Iran is moving towards policies that may help them compensate for the lost revenue.” This includes removing tax exemptions for some sectors, selling government assets and cutting fuel subsidies.
However, Mr Nasseri emphasised that a large part of of China’s imports would be compensation for their investment in upstream oil developments in Iran, so would not yield a big revenue boost for the economy.
An Iranian oil businessman said the Islamic republic was confident that China would buy Iranian crude even if it chose to do so quietly.
The Salina had loaded oil on Kharg Island on approximately May 28 — weeks after the US had removed the waivers, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers, which provided satellite images of the vessel provided to them by Planet Labs, a satellite imagery company.
“This is the first Iranian tanker that has delivered crude oil that had departed Iran after the US removed the waivers in early May, with the exception of oil Iran has been sending to Syria,” Mr Madani said. “Based on tankers we have been tracking we expect China to take more Iranian oil in the coming days.”
A separate Iranian supertanker with a capacity of 2m barrels looked like it would dock in the Chinese province of Tianjin in the next 24 hours, Mr Madani added.
Chinese customs data showed Iranian supplies to China fell to 255,065 b/d in May, from 792,380 b/d in April and a 2018 average of 586,241 b/d.
Saudi Arabia and Iraq have vied to replace Iranian barrels.
The US has also stepped in to make up the shortfall.
Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, Iran’s oil minister, said this week that reports that showed a big drop in the country’s crude exports were “sheer lies”.
“I am not going to disclose any figures because that would not benefit us,” Mr Zanganeh told the Fars news agency on Monday.
The US state department did not immediately return a request for comment.

Chinese regulators are hitting the brakes on a record surge in US dollar bond sales by local government financing companies despite unprecedented demand for the debt.
Local government financing vehicles, which have been used for years by Chinese cities and provinces to raise funds for local infrastructure projects, sold $12.4bn in US dollar bonds in the first half of the year, according to Dealogic, nearly doubling issuance from the same period last year.
The boom in debt deals, however, is expected to come to an abrupt end on Friday, after which Chinese regulators are likely to impose stricter rules on the companies.
The National Development and Reform Commission said in mid-June that it would only allow LGFVs to refinance existing debt in the second half of the year, as Beijing grows wary of building offshore repayment pressures.
It is still unclear if some of the companies will be allowed to renew unused quotas, but investors foresee a swift drop-off in new debt sales starting next week.
“We expect new names to be much rarer in the second half of the year,” said Sophia Sui, a fixed-income investment analyst at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Singapore.
She noted that many LGFV quotas for US dollar bonds would be likely to expire at the end of June.
The signalling from China’s top economic planner has pushed LGFVs to charge to the market in the final two weeks of June to take advantage of strong investor demand for their debt.
At least seven LGFVs rushed to market in the days following the announcement.
A three-year $300m bond sold by Sichuan Railway Investment Group on June 20 with a 3.8 per cent coupon was 12 times oversubscribed, according to an investor.
“People chase these like free money,” said one investment manager at a state-backed investment group in Hong Kong, because the bonds appear to be supported by the central government, which wants cities and provinces to build more infrastructure and stimulate local economies.
Until recently, global investors have taken a tepid approach to LGFVs, given their unclear status as quasi-state entities.
Prior to 2014, when local governments were allowed to begin issuing bonds directly, LGFVs were the primary channel for financing public projects in many cities around China.
But they have proved difficult for the central government to manage, as many LGFVs took large exposures to high-yield loans from shadow lenders.
S&P Global warned in late 2018 that LGFVs may have accrued Rmb30tn to Rmb40tn （$4.3tn to $5.8tn） in off-balance-sheet funding, or a “ debt iceberg with titanic credit risks”.
In some cases, such as the default on US dollar debt of one such company in Qinghai province earlier this year, central support has clearly fallen short.
The latest signal from China’s economic planner has indicated that it is growing cautious again, but this time on offshore liabilities.
“The government wants to control the contingent liability at the local level,” said Ivan Chung, head of greater China credit research at Moody’s. “They also want to encourage local governments to borrow more directly because it’s hard for them to control how LGFVs use the funds.”
About $20bn in LGFV debt will mature between 2020 and 2022, with a peak of $7bn in 2021, Dealogic data showed.

Last week, the Bank of England released the result of an independent review of the future of finance, together with its response.
As if to prove the importance of these issues, Facebook and 27 partners announced a plan for a global digital currency to be called  Libra, and an associated payment system.
How should one assess the significance, promise and risks of these developments?
How should the regulators react?
The answer is: with caution.
The information revolution, now augmented by artificial intelligence, will surely revolutionise finance.
It offers huge potential benefits, in the form of faster and cheaper payments, superior financial services and better risk management.
Already, we see a marked decline in the use of cash and explosive growth in digital payments.
In China, the revolution in payment technology, led by Alipay （now part of Ant Financial） is extraordinary.
Facebook is trying to create a rival.
Note: the US is here following China.
Yet finance is also a critical infrastructure.
A financial breakdown is likely to create a huge economic crisis.
Ill-understood innovation has often proved a midwife of such calamities.
It is vital therefore to ensure that the implications of big innovations, such as Libra, are understood.
Mark Carney, governor of the BoE, argued last week in his Mansion House speech that the bank “approaches Libra with an open mind but not an open door”.
The mind cannot be entirely open, however.
A first question must be whether we can trust the sponsor of so sensitive an innovation.
Facebook has been grossly irresponsible over its impact on our democracies.
It cannot obviously be trusted with our payments systems.
Facebook has an answer: it has just one vote in the Libra Association, which will have independent governance located in Geneva.
The aim is to have 100 members by the launch in 2020.
But Facebook seems likely to dominate Libra’s technical development.
That will surely give it predominant influence.
Randal Quarles, chairman of the Financial Stability Board, is right to tell leaders of the G20 nations, meeting in Japan, that “a wider use of new types of cryptoassets for retail payment purposes would warrant close scrutiny by authorities to ensure that they are subject to high standards of regulation”.
Thus, quite apart from doubts about the sponsor, a new global payment system must be evaluated for its technical stability, impact on monetary and financial stability （ not least in developing countries） and openness to fraudsters, criminals and terrorists.
Big questions also arise about concentrations of power, should the venture succeed.
Today’s plan is only for a payment system.
The currency itself is, in the words of the Libra white paper, to be “fully backed by a reserve of real assets. A basket of bank deposits and short-term government securities will be held in the Libra Reserve for every Libra that is created, building trust in its intrinsic value.”
That value will, however, be vulnerable to foreign exchange fluctuations and financial shocks （including exchange controls）.
Its movements relative to currencies could disturb users.
Regulators will have to assess the instabilities associated with such a system.
I cannot judge the technical stability of the proposed system.
The claim that it is based on “blockchain” technology  seems rather questionable.
But only fanatical supporters of “permissionless” systems need worry about that.
What matters most is that the system is robust, resistant to breaches and protects personal privacy, while being sufficiently transparent to regulators, judicial authorities and others with a legitimate interest in who uses it.
A crucial issue is how Libra would interact with traditional banks.
It might deprive them of a large proportion of their customers, on the payments side.
Instead, the Libra system might hold huge deposits in the banks, matched, on the other side of its balance sheets, by customers’ holdings of Libra.
Alternatively, as Mr Carney said: “As new payment providers and systems emerge, access to the [BoE’s] core infrastructure should change and it makes sense to consider whether they too can hold funds overnight on the bank’s balance sheet.” To the extent that central banks create these reserves （a decision they alone make）, a system like Libra might circumvent the traditional bank-based payment systems altogether. The historic advantages of banks as informed lenders might disappear.
A far more significant possibility emerges: the Libra system, with its knowledge of customers, would become a lender itself, thereby usurping traditional banks on the asset side of their balance sheets.
At worst, the world might have a Facebook-dominated mono-bank.
The risks of that are huge: potential monetary and financial instability, concentrated economic and political power, lack of privacy and many other issues.
A global currency, created by the lending of a global bank （since banks create money as a byproduct of their loans）, in a currency （the Libra） not backed by any central bank, and with no dominant regulator, seems to create a nightmarish risk to stability.
There is indeed potential for greatly improved payment systems.
But the emergence of a payment system on a network of Facebook’s scale would raise some huge questions.
Should Libra ultimately develop into a true banking system, with the capacity to create its own fiat （man-made） currency, the questions would become yet more pressing.
Even if lending by the Libra system is ruled out, regulators should not allow this plan to go ahead without fully understanding the implications.
This would be true even if the lead sponsor were not Facebook.
But it is.
So beware.

US stocks looked to end a three-day losing streak on Wednesday as investors measured hopes for a breakthrough in the trade dispute between the US and China against the latest rhetoric from Washington.
Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the fringes of this week’s G20 summit in Osaka.
Mr Trump told Fox News it was possible the US would reach a deal with China, but additional tariffs remained an option if not.
Beforehand, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC that a deal was “90 per cent complete”.
That assessment echoed remarks made in April, but it was enough to lift risk appetite, an effect that was sustained in the run-up to the New York open as Mr Trump gave his latest interview.
Mr Trump also doubled down on his criticism of the Federal Reserve, going as far as suggesting the European Central Bank’s president, Mario Draghi, should take the helm of the US central bank because chairman Jay Powell was doing a “bad job”.
Wall Street’s S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent, bouncing higher after three consecutive negative sessions.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq, seen as exposed to any further tariffs, rose 0.6 per cent.

Donald Trump arrived in Osaka for the G20 summit on Thursday after a 24-hour period that saw the US president attack several allies, including Japan and India, whose leaders he will meet at the two-day summit.
In an interview with Fox Business before leaving Washington, Mr Trump slammed the EU for bringing a raft of antitrust cases against US technology companies and called into question the US-Japan security alliance.
As Air Force One flew over the Pacific en route to Osaka, he focused his ire on India. “I look forward to speaking with Prime Minister Modi about the fact that India, for years having put very high Tariffs against the United States, just recently increased the Tariffs even further,” Mr Trump said in a tweet. “This is unacceptable. and the Tariffs must be withdrawn!”
His comments point to the potential for a turbulent summit that will include his first meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping following the collapse of trade talks between the US and China last month.
As the G20 leaders began to arrive in Osaka, their country representative “Sherpas” were already locked in difficult negotiations over the summit communiqué.
Participants said the US was digging in over trade and that even the language used by G20 trade ministers at a meeting a few weeks ago might be difficult to agree unless the leaders are able to break the logjam.
European governments are still arguing for a reference to “fighting protectionism” but few expect it to be included in the end.
The future of the World Trade Organization has emerged as a particularly difficult issue.
The WTO’s dispute resolution mechanism is in danger of collapse because the US is refusing to appoint appellate justices.
Europe and Japan want to address that issue but the US is demanding wholesale reform of the institution first.
The US and Europe are also far apart on climate change and the environment policy, according to senior German officials.
Mr Trump is scheduled to hold meetings with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Mr Trump used his Fox interview to once again question the decades-old US-Japan security alliance that most experts say has played a critical role in maintaining peace in the Pacific. His comments will not be welcomed by Mr Abe who has gone to great lengths to flatter the US president in an effort to ward off such attacks.
Mike Green, a former top White House Asia adviser to George W Bush, said Mr Trump’s comments were “ignorant” because there were “few scenarios” for conflict in Asia where the US and Japan would not both be in harm’s way.
“What does the president hope to gain by attacking the major ally who supports him more than any other?” he said.
Mr Trump is scheduled to meet Ms Merkel on Friday morning, in what will be their first bilateral meeting since the president criticised the German leader at a Nato summit in Brussels last summer.
He has repeatedly rebuked European countries that have not met the goal for each country to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence, but he has reserved his harshest attacks on Germany and Ms Merkel.
Mr Trump’s attacks on US allies and partners resurrected memories of the G7 meeting in Canada last year, where the president instructed his officials not to sign the communiqué after he took offence at comments by Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. People familiar with Mr Trump’s view of large summits say he enjoys the G20 even less than the G7 because it is harder for him to remain the centre of attention among so many leaders.
As Mr Trump was flying to Osaka, he said in a tweet: “I’m on Air Force One, off the save the Free World!”

For the second time in seven months, a gathering of the leaders of the world’s 20 largest economies will be eclipsed by a “sidelines” meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, who on Saturday will try to revive their countries’ stalled trade negotiations.
The encounter between the US and Chinese presidents in Osaka, Japan, comes just weeks after talks to end their year-long trade war broke down in acrimonious circumstances, with each side blaming the other for negotiating in bad faith and then raising punitive tariffs on about half of each other’s exports.
While both sides hope that they can at least restart formal trade negotiations after this weekend’s encounter between the two presidents, another bust-up is also possible if Mr Trump follows through on his earlier threat to impose tariffs on all Chinese exports to the US.
Chinese officials say Mr Trump’s willingness to impose new tariffs at critical junctures in the trade talks, coupled with his administration’s recent moves to deny leading Chinese technology companies access to US components and software, has eroded what little trust Mr Xi still had in his American counterpart.
“China has learnt a big lesson over the past year,” said one senior Chinese official.
“For four decades we admired and tried to emulate the US in many respects, but now we know that they can turn on us without warning.”
After Mr Trump and Mr Xi similarly revived their stalled trade negotiations on the sidelines of last year’s G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, Beijing officials were shocked when it emerged that on the same day a senior executive at Shenzhen-based Huawei Technologies was detained in Canada pending her possible extradition to the US to face bank fraud charges.
Huawei was separately threatened with a US sourcing ban, which could potentially cripple the company, after the latest breakdown in trade talks in early May.
The order restricting Huawei’s access to US components, which will take full effect in mid-August, has been met in China with a mixture of alarm and defiance.
In response, Mr Xi has urged his nation to prepare itself for a “long march” towards technological self-reliance.
“The US should cancel [the order] but if they don’t, we aren’t afraid; it will only make us stronger,” Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder, told the Financial Times in an interview this week.
Dennis Wilder, a former top White House Asia aide, said China “played hard to get” in the run-up to this weekend’s G20 encounter because it wanted to ensure Mr Xi was not left as empty-handed as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was after his summit earlier this year with Mr Trump in Hanoi.
While the US president wants to focus his discussion with Mr Xi on trade, Mr Wilder said the Chinese president wanted to have a broader discussion and persuade Mr Trump “not to take the course his hardline secretary of state and national security adviser want him to take on China strategy”.
He added: “China has low expectations of easing the overall strategic competition, but they still believe that Trump as a businessman is capable of making deals with them on issues such as Huawei that can place a floor under the relationship.”
One person briefed on Beijing’s preparations for the Osaka meeting said the top item on Mr Xi’s agenda was the broader downward spiral in relations between the world’s two largest economies over the past year and a half, rather than their trade dispute per se.
“This is going to be a much more holistic discussion about getting the relationship back on the right track,” the person said.
“There’s a lot to discuss.”
But Wendy Cutler, a former US trade negotiator now at the Asia Society, said failure to make progress on the trade dispute would only hurt the broader relationship.
“The trade issues are the easiest to resolve among the long list of flash points in our relationship on technology, security and ideology,” said Ms Cutler.
“Without progress on trade, it’s hard to see how the other matters have a chance of being tackled.”
Ely Ratner, a China expert at the Center for a New American Security, a bipartisan US think-tank, said the odds of a big breakthrough were “low” and the meeting would be largely “theatre”, in which case the result would be further acceleration of “the now inevitable reversal of decades of economic integration between the US and China”.
Some observers believe Mr Trump is under less pressure to reach a trade deal because the US economy remains strong and the stock market has not suffered any long-term negative impact from trade tensions with China.
While Mr Trump faces increasing pressure from US farmers whose exports to China have collapsed, his administration provided them with subsidies last year and is promising them more relief this year.
“Even as trade frictions persist, [Mr Trump] has the opportunity to see where the Chinese side is since the talks last left off,” a US official said ahead of the Osaka summit.
“But the president is quite comfortable with any outcome.”

Investment in central London offices fell more than a third in the first half of the year as Brexit cast a shadow over one of the UK’s healthier property markets.
According to figures from property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield, investors are on track to trade £5.5bn of central London office buildings in the first half of 2019, a 37 per cent drop from a year earlier.
Julian Sandbach, head of central London capital markets at property agents JLL, said: “Much [investor] capital is sitting on the sidelines awaiting further clarification on Brexit outcomes.”
James Beckham, head of London investment properties at rival CBRE, said: “The obvious presenting issue is Brexit, but I think there is also a stand-off between buyers and sellers, so there is not so much stock on the market.”
Agents say the collapse of a small number of office transactions has led to caution among sellers, who are reluctant to risk placing a building on the market and then having to withdraw it if they do not receive high enough offers.
Martin Lay, co-head of London capital markets at Cushman, said: “Activity . . . is continuing to be held back by a lack of available opportunities, as reflected by only 14 assets with a total investment volume of £639m being brought to the market so far in June, compared with £2.7bn in 37 deals this time last year.”
He said domestic and overseas investors were still looking to buy London properties, however.
About £2.1bn of office buildings are at present under offer in 20 potential deals across the capital.
Mr Beckham said the sale of 8 Finsbury Circus, a City of London building placed on the market this year with an asking price of £260m by the Japanese group Mitsubishi Estate, would be a test of the market.
The London office market has proved more resilient than many analysts expected since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, partly thanks to strong demand for office space from tech companies and shared office groups such as WeWork.
Vacancy rates across central London have fallen from 5 per cent to 4.5 per cent over the past year, according to Cushman, while City of London office yields have remained around 4 per cent in the first quarter, a 10-year low.
Capital from China and South Korea — partly lured by the weakness of sterling— has helped bolster the investment market since the 2016 vote.
Annual London office investment volumes were almost £20bn in 2017 and £19.5bn last year, Cushman said.
But investment from those countries has receded for now. “We are yet to see a new international capital source emerge,” said Mr Sandbach, adding that private individuals, family offices and local UK buyers had stepped into the gap.
Economists at Capital Economics said on Wednesday that “the increased chance of a no deal Brexit” was weighing on commercial property markets, while monthly office rental growth had stalled — although on an annual basis, rents continued to increase.

Liquor maker Kweichow Moutai became the first Chinese stock to touch the milestone of Rmb1,000 （$145） as the world's largest distiller by market capitalisation continued its march higher.
Kweichow Moutai shares touched a record high of Rmb1,001 in morning trading on Thursday, before pulling back at the lunch break to be 1.8 per cent higher at Rmb997.32.
Shares in Kweichow Moutai, which makes a premium version of the grain liquor known as baijiu, have risen by almost 70 per cent in 2019, against a 27 per cent gain for the CSI 300 index. Kweichow Moutai  overtook Diageo to become the largest liquor group by market cap in 2017.
Fellow distillers Wuliangye Yibin and Anhui Gujing  also rose on Thursday, with their shares up 2.8 per cent  and 4.2 per cent respectively.
"Moutai is a household name in China, focused almost purely domestically and hence it is relatively uncorrelated with the developments in the trade front," said Gerry Alfonso of Shenwan Hongyuan Securities, adding that the stock is popular among China's retail investors.
The Guizhou-based liquor maker's gains reflect recent broader positive sentiment for high-end brands as some investors see them "becoming immune from the economic cyclical due to brand scarcity and collecting value,” according to a note in April from Summer Wang, analyst at Jefferies.
Kweichow Moutai is  one of the most popular stocks on the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock connect, a trading link between the two exchanges.

It was perfect choreography, with impeccable — if dangerous — footwork from Iran.
Confronted with overwhelming pressure from Donald Trump’s US administration, Tehran resorted to the military tactics that have long been its hallmark.
The Iranians poked, tested and delivered warnings, so America and its allies in the region could be in no doubt about its offensive abilities.
The recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf and last week’s downing of a US surveillance drone were designed, in Iranian minds, to deter American military aggression, rather than spark it.
Other messages came through rocket attacks on oilfields in southern Iraq, where Iran is the most powerful power broker and the US has multiple assets.
Mr Trump blinked, calling off at the last minute the series of military strikes on Iranian targets he had just ordered.
I doubt he was swayed by his stated reason: to avoid collateral damage.
For all his bluster, he is an isolationist by instinct.
He knows all too well the history of US interventions in the Middle East: it is easy to start a war there but far more difficult to win it — or end it.
On Sunday, he went as far as to praise Iran’s restraint, noting that its military had spared a manned US spy plane flying next to the drone.
What may prove to be Mr Trump’s wisest foreign policy decision to date handed Iran a rare victory.
Yet Tehran still faces the same dire conditions, with sanctions devastating its economy and no hope of respite.
More sanctions were announced by the US administration on Monday, this time directly targeting the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The threat of war persists, whether through American miscalculation or Iranian over-reach.
One wrong move by either side could easily spiral out of control.
If Iran’s military ploys have worked so far, it is time to deploy its diplomatic skills.
The country’s leaders should seize on the aborted US attack to justify contact with the White House.
Admittedly, there is something of the irrational in talking to the administration that sparked the crisis by withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the most significant diplomatic achievement in the region for decades.
But the US’s internal divisions on Iran and the lack of a strategy pose too high a risk.
And Tehran’s shift from an earlier policy of restraint to escalation is reaching its limits.
Starting a diplomatic process, if only to drag it out, is the only sensible path to de-escalation.
Despite the defiant rhetoric coming out of Tehran, Iran is in a bind.
Until recently, it had counted on the other signatories of the nuclear agreement — France, the UK, Germany, Russia and China — to deliver some of the economic benefits promised in return for curbing its atomic programme.
But when the choice for European companies and financial institutions is between the US market and the Iranian, they inevitably pick the former.
They cannot be forced to act against their commercial interests.
Meanwhile, the US has been piling on the pressure, aiming to deprive Iran of all its oil export revenues and designating the Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite force that is part of the armed forces, a terrorist organisation.
In May, Iran’s patience ran out.
Hassan Rouhani, the centrist president and architect of the nuclear deal, warned that Tehran would stop abiding by elements of the accord within a period of 60 days that expires in early July.
Breaching the agreement might give Iran more leverage in future negotiations, but it would also alienate the European powers that have been sympathetic to its cause.
However distasteful dialogue might appear to Iran, bringing the US back into the nuclear accord should be the primary objective.
Europeans can help by acting as intermediaries or persuading Mr Trump to name an Iran envoy from outside the group of hawks who surround him.
Given Mr Trump’s aversion to military intervention, ultimately a new accord may be achievable through tweaks rather than substantive change.
Mr Trump has shown he can change course when opportunity arises, or rip apart an agreement and then declare victory by signing up to suspiciously similar terms.
If he can put his stamp on an Iran accord, what he has labelled the “worst” deal ever could miraculously become the “best” deal of all time.

Flawed, derided, feared: Facebook’s proposal for a new virtual currency, revealed last week, has already provoked a backlash.
But might it end up blowing the financial system wide open anyway?
The idea marks a “long overdue” attack by Big Tech on the payments industry, says David Yermack, a finance professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business.
Apple has carved out a limited role for its own payments system on the iPhone: by contrast, Facebook’s plan is a full-frontal assault.
The planned launch, within a year, of its Libra digital currency would have the backing of partners like the payment networks Visa and Mastercard and internet companies Uber and eBay.
Facebook itself would create a “killer app” to take advantage of this digital money: a payment system embedded into its messaging services, so that users can easily and cheaply send money to friends or make purchases.
With 2.4bn users, the social networking company could single-handedly propel cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, according to its supporters, fulfilling hopes first stirred by bitcoin a decade ago.
“The threat to the existing banks is severe,” says Mr Yermack. Companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon have two significant advantages over banks, he adds: they can process transactions at much lower cost, and they have proven themselves masters at creating new digital services, drawing billions of people to their platforms.
But the barriers to entry are also high and the resistance already extensive.
Politicians, privacy activists and bankers have been among those lining up to question the proposal in the days since it was unveiled.
That Facebook and its partners plan to forge ahead anyway is testament to how much is at stake.
The many criticisms and warnings stirred up over the last week have centred around three main areas.
The first concerns the credibility of Facebook itself.
After the furore over Russian interference in the last US presidential election, including through content that appeared on Facebook, the social network is regarded with deep distrust.
Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer, at first denied any responsibility, but has struck a note of humility as he tries to fix the social network.
But with its plans for a new cryptocurrency, Facebook’s unbounded ambition has been revived.
The company has talked of reaching billions of people with its payment service.
In an interview, Kevin Weil, vice-president of the proposed Facebook payment service, says the company hopes the new currency would last “hundreds of years”.
Even fans of the idea find it hard to believe Facebook can contemplate such a project, given the political and regulatory pressure it faces.
Mamoon Hamid, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins who has invested in a similar payments idea from messaging service Telegram, applauds the vision, but says: “Whether the world we live in wants them to do this is another matter. Things have changed over the past two years.”
Facebook executives have been at pains to stress that any financial services they create will be properly regulated.
But it is already clear that the company hopes to skirt banking regulations, something that has antagonised executives in the sector.
Mr Weil says the company would look to offer other financial services such as credit but adds: “We’re not a bank, we don’t view ourselves that way. We’re not offering interest, for example, and things that banks do.” The distinction is one that many predict will not hold, as financial regulators subject the wayward internet company to heightened scrutiny.
There have also been questions about Facebook’s promise to keep its users’ financial information separate and not use it to target advertising.
The sharing of data with other Facebook services would be possible if users opt in to certain services.
And even without the opt-in, a Facebook service like WhatsApp would be able to see when a user makes a payment, as well as to whom, giving it valuable information.
Putting so much data in one organisation is asking for trouble, particularly given Facebook’s past failures, says Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a Washington pressure group opposed to excessive concentration of corporate power.
He also warns that Facebook would be in a position to leverage its dominant position in social networking to move into a new market — something that might be opposed by antitrust regulators.
The fact that more than two dozen other companies and organisations have already provisionally backed the Libra project, despite Facebook’s obvious political and regulatory challenges, highlights the scale of the opportunity.
For all its failings, Facebook, with its massive user base, could open the way to bringing cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.
That has stirred hopes in Silicon Valley for a new generation of financial services, built on top of the new Libra backbone.
Many developers have been “sitting on the sidelines of crypto and really want to take the plunge,” says Katie Haun, a former US prosecutor who now runs a cryptocurrency fund for Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.
“This will be a catalyst for a lot of talent coming in to the space.”
The second major area of concern about Facebook’s plan stems from the nature of the currency itself, and whether it would leave too much financial power in the hands of a self-selected group of big companies. The plan calls for Libra to operate on a version of a blockchain — a decentralised ledger, maintained by all participants in the network, where transactions would be recorded.
Yet it would stop short of the ideal of decentralisation pioneered by the bitcoin blockchain, where anyone can validate transactions. That creates a permissionless system where no central authority decides who is worthy of trust. Public blockchains like this cannot operate at the scale and speed needed to handle the massive number of real-time transactions that will be required with Libra, says Avivah Litan, blockchain analyst at Gartner.
Instead, the Libra backers aim to create a private network of 100 companies that can be trusted to post transactions, without the need for any independent validation system.
The promoters say they aim to start moving to a truly permissionless network within five years — although not everyone involved believes this will be technically possible.
Regardless of this limitation, Libra “is probably a much more efficient system” than today’s bank-controlled payment networks, Ms Litan says. “But it’s still controlled by the big corporations.” She and others warn that this would put considerable power into the hands of a group of private entities — particularly if Libra turns into the kind of global currency that Facebook hopes.
A closed private group like this could also invite an antitrust challenge, says Mr Stoller — particularly when it involves two duopolists, Visa and Mastercard, working together on a project.
For cryptocurrency purists, these shortcomings are serious.
“It is not decentralised, so customers are at the mercy of Facebook, and it is not frictionless — it still uses the banking system and is tied to political currency,” says Tim Draper, one of Silicon Valley’s earliest backers of cryptocurrencies.
But even many people opposed to seeing Facebook launch a cryptocurrency accept that it could have wider benefits.
Libra “has a great distribution channel in Facebook, and it provides a bridge for those who are not yet ready to convert all their transactions to bitcoin,” Mr Draper concedes.
That could make it “a great interim step toward a fully open, truly global, transparent and frictionless currency like bitcoin.”
The third area of concern is whether a new currency like Libra could pose deeper systemic risks, while also interfering with the ability of central banks to police their financial systems and operate normal monetary policy.
If so, governments and regulators may try to strangle it at birth.
Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has made it clear that the potential systemic risks in a system like Libra will require it to be subjected to the highest levels of scrutiny.
By operating outside normal banking channels, critics warn it could be harder for governments to limit payments out of a country, or apply sanctions against a foreign power. “Any parallel currency to some extent undermines the sovereign institutions that control currency,” says Mr Stoller. “The reason this one seems particularly significant is because it’s Facebook. This isn’t just some libertarian dudes who hang out at strip joints, smoking weed and trading in bitcoin. It’s Visa and Mastercard.”
Some Libra critics say that it would also leave private corporations with undue influence over monetary conditions.
Facebook and its allies deny this.
They point out that Libra will be fully backed by a basket of government-issued, or fiat, currency, meaning that the system would not create any new money.
Instead, the fiat currency would sit in reserve, while its digital alter-ego is set free on the internet, bringing down transaction costs and supporting new types of services.
Yet mass adoption of the currency could still have distorting effects.
Libra’s backers hope that a large number of people in the developing world opt to hold Libra deposits rather than their country’s currencies.
That could weaken the power of the local authorities, who would have less influence over monetary conditions if many transactions in the economy were implicitly backed by foreign currency.
As Thomas Adrian, an IMF official, put it in a speech last month, countries with weak currencies might find it harder to muddle through in times of crisis: “One either makes it or is taken over by foreign e-money.”
Even without Libra, digital money systems backed by official currency have become widely used in some parts of the world.
They are led by China’s booming mobile payment systems, run by Alibaba and Tencent — one reason why Silicon Valley, which is in a race with China’s tech leaders on the world stage, argue that regulators in Washington should not be too heavy-handed.
“The genie is already out of the bottle with this technology,” says Ms Haun.
Some central bankers may be ready to engage with the new era of digital currencies.
Mr Carney on Thursday said the Bank of England could potentially allow tech companies to store funds overnight at the central bank, giving them an alternative to leaving deposits with commercial banks.
Giving direct access to the central bank like this would bring down costs for these payments systems and put them on an equal footing with commercial banks.
It would also bring central banks one step closer to issuing digital currencies.
The financial authorities have little choice but to try to adapt, says Mr Yermack.
If they try to crack down on Libra or other projects like it, the tech companies could easily take their payment plans offshore.
As Libra’s potential shortcomings have been picked over, meanwhile, there has been less attention to how the digital currency — or other ideas like it — might affect the world of finance, were they to catch on.
So far, Facebook and other Libra members have sought to put the focus on cross-border remittances, where fees could be slashed, and the chance to offer basic financial services to the 1.7bn of people in the world who do not have a bank account.
These represent the most politically palatable uses of the currency, and the ones most likely to win official support.
But the widespread use of e-money would also have broader implications.
Just because financial services work “well enough” in many developed countries do not mean there isn’t plenty of room for improvement, says Ms Haun: “They’re slow, they’re inefficient, you pay middlemen along the way.”
Facebook appears to have something like this planned for Calibra, the payment service it hopes to launch on the Libra blockchain.
Integrated into its messaging services, this would support a new era of online commerce.
A true digital currency has other advantages.
It could be used for micropayments, according to Facebook, potentially bringing a new way for users to pay for digital content as they read it or watch it.
Further ahead, Libra’s backers say they plan to introduce “smart contracts” on to the network — arrangements where money changes hands automatically when certain real-world conditions are met.
How this might affect a future world where machine-to-machine communications and intelligent agents hold sway is the stuff of Silicon Valley fever dreams.
It could lead to autonomous vehicles, for instance, that decide for themselves when it’s worth paying to move into an express lane, and handle the payment automatically.
Libra may never play a part in this imagined future.
Worries about Facebook — along with inherent limitations in the project itself — could well doom it to failure.
But as digital money systems spread to more corners of the digital world, the prospects for truly disruptive change in finance are rising.

China has now found the crop-destroying fall armyworm in over half of its provinces, further threatening the country's food security amid an outbreak of African swine fever that has led to the culling of at least 1m pigs.
China's agriculture ministry said on Wednesday that it had found fall armyworm in 19 of its 34 provinces, largely in the south of the country, covering 5m mu （333,333 hectares） of cropland.
The ministry added that it was continuing to spread north, but that "timely and vigorous preventative measures" had slowed its progression.
China is the world's second-largest producer of corn, with production of the staple focused in the country's north east.
Fall armyworm is a caterpillar native to North and South America.
It was first detected in Africa in 2016, and has gradually spread across South and Southeast Asia.
Invasions can result in corn yield losses as high as 50 per cent, and adult moths can travel hundreds of kilometres.
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation has said fall armyworm "is far too widespread and numerous to be eliminated" from areas it has invaded extensively, leaving farmers to attempt to limit losses through a combination of chemical and biological pesticides, genetically modified variants of corn or alternative crops.
Their relentless march comes as China is battling an outbreak of  African swine fever.
More than 1m pigs have been culled across China, devastating a domestic pork industry worth some $128bn.
Swine fever has now spread to every province in China.
The twin outbreaks are expected to further push up food price inflation, according to analysts at Capital Economics.
Data released earlier this month showed  consumer prices rising at the fastest pace in 15 months, driven largely by an 18.2 per cent year on year rise in pork prices.

Donald Trump broadened his economic assault on Washington’s allies on Wednesday, lashing out at Brussels for its aggressive pursuit of antitrust cases against US technology groups as actions by a EU regulator who “hates” America.
The US president added that any lawsuits against the likes of Google and Facebook should be brought by American authorities instead of those in Europe, and suggested federal prosecutors could go after Twitter for bias against his political allies.
In an interview with Fox Business, Mr Trump saved his strongest criticism for Margarethe Vestager, the EU antitrust commissioner who has won praise in Europe for attempting to rein in Amazon, Apple and Google for alleged abuse of their dominant market positions or corporate tax avoidance.
“She hates the United States perhaps worse than any person I’ve ever met,” said Mr Trump.
“What she does to our country. She’s suing all our companies. We should be suing Google and Facebook, and all that.”
He added: “They’re suing Apple. They’re suing everybody.”
Although Mr Trump has aimed much of his “America First” economic firepower against China, he has also launched repeated trade offensives against close allies like Japan, Canada and the EU.

Shenzhen is only a 14-minute train ride away from Hong Kong but a world apart when it comes to the flow of information.
When images of the violent protests in the former British colony began to filter through on Chinese social media, 24-year-old web designer Stephanie asked her friend who studies in the US to send her detailed press reports.
By late afternoon, she and her colleagues were watching videos of confrontations between young demonstrators and the Hong Kong police being uploaded on to YouTube at their company, one of China’s big technology groups that provides unfiltered internet access to its employees.
“Everyone glanced at the videos. No one was particularly interested after they got the gist of what was going on,” said Stephanie, who only spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Some complained it would be inconvenient if they couldn’t go shopping in Hong Kong for a while.”
As Hong Kong has become embroiled in its worst crisis in decades over a proposed extradition law, which would allow anyone passing through the territory to be sent to mainland China to stand trial, Chinese censorship and misinformation is widening the gulf between people on either side of the border.
On June 10, the day after about 1m people marched through Hong Kong demanding the government withdraw the bill, the official China Daily newspaper reported that 800,000 people had signed a petition in support of the proposed law.
The following weekend, after Hong Kong saw the largest protests in its history when about 2m people peacefully demonstrated against the bill, the China Daily carried a report that the city’s parents had marched against US interference in the territory and condemned “foreign entities” for misleading young people in the city.
The narrative in Chinese state media aimed at domestic audiences has focused on the violence of a radical few while the framing of stories for the outside world is that the US should stop meddling in Beijing’s internal affairs, even as the government in Hong Kong suspended the bill “indefinitely” following the demonstrations.
Mainland Chinese who want information beyond the official narrative on the protests face the uphill battle of staying one step ahead of censors on Chinese social media such as WeChat and Weibo, which have scrubbed details of the events.
In interviews with 14 young mainland Chinese who mostly work in high tech or study at top universities in Shenzhen, many described how they learnt about the protests through word of mouth or online — photos of the protests and screenshots of external news reports escaped censorship algorithms by being posted upside down or covered in squiggles and shapes — rather than through the news.
While some knew the dispute was connected to a proposed law, many said they were unsure of the details of the conflict or what the protesters wanted.
Beijing has carefully curated its messages in state media and coverage of these protests has been “fairly typical and predictable”, according to Anne-Marie Brady, a China expert at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.
“But it is always remarkable to observe how effective the Chinese Communist party is at maintaining the censorship boundaries, even in the era of global internet.”
One mainland student who is studying in Hong Kong said he was disheartened by how little his friends at home knew about the protest: “I try my best [to] promote and explain via WeChat moments but that’s also risky . . . [People in Hong Kong] are so brave, tough and strong . . . the power is so encouraging.”
The lack of contact might be to blame for the lack of knowledge.
Zheng Ge, a law professor who teaches at Peking University’s Shenzhen campus but also taught in Hong Kong for 10 years, said: “In order for young people to be interested in the Hong Kong protests, they need to have concrete ties with Hong Kong.”
That separation has benefited China in its attempts to control the narrative.
But it also raises questions about how Beijing will be able to roll out its signature Greater Bay Area policy, which links Hong Kong and nearby Macau with nine mainland Chinese cities including Shenzhen to turn the area into a powerhouse of innovation and economic growth.
For now, though, the views of one student in Shenzhen are not uncommon.
“I think young people in Shenzhen aren’t that interested in the protests in Hong Kong because of our own prejudices,” said Irving, a 24-year-old who is studying for his masters degree.
“We think Hong Kongers are British lackeys who are arrogant and see themselves as better than us.
“We’ve also grown up in different political systems. China has always been authoritarian whereas Hong Kong hasn’t been. Plus, we don’t even use the same social media platforms — that makes it hard to communicate.”

FedEx on Tuesday topped its twice-lowered expectations for quarterly earnings and cautioned that a slower global economy and trade uncertainty will continue to drag on its business in the next year.
The logistics company, considered an economic bellwether, had already cut its outlook for the year ended May 2019 in the previous two quarters, hampered by a slowdown in China and weaker trade globally.
And its current fiscal year, ending May 2020, macroeconomic weakness, trade uncertainty and a “strategic decision to not renew a customer contract” will knock the company’s results further, FedEx said.
The company announced earlier this month it would not be renewing a FedEx Express contract to deliver for Amazon, saying it would instead focus on serving the broader ecommerce market.
Amazon accounted for a small portion of the parcel carrier’s total revenue — less than 1.3 per cent in the 2018 calendar year, according to FedEx.
“While we are adjusting our costs to mitigate revenue weakness and market shifts, we will continue to invest in areas that expand our capabilities, improve our long-term efficiencies and reduce our cost to serve,” FedEx chief financial officer Alan Graf said in a statement.
FedEx said it expects a mid-single digit percentage point decline in earnings per share in fiscal 2020, before a year-end retirement plan accounting adjustment and excluding the costs of integrating TNT Express.
Adjusted earnings were $15.52 a share in fiscal 2019.
FedEx has been caught in the middle of the Trump administration’s crackdown on Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment maker, since the US commerce department added Huawei to an “entity list” of companies barred from purchasing US technology without government approval.
FedEx apologised after misrouting some packages destined for Huawei in China from Japan, sending them to the US instead.
China said it launched an investigation into the company, igniting concerns that Beijing could blacklist FedEx.
The company, based in Memphis, Tennessee, sued the US commerce department on Monday, alleging that restrictions put in place by the Trump administration have placed “an unreasonable burden” on FedEx by forcing it to check millions of packages shipped each day for potential violations.
“FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,” it said in a statement.
In its results released after the bell on Tuesday, FedEx booked a net loss of $1.97bn in its fourth quarter that ended May 31, down from a profit of $1.13bn in the same period a year ago.
On an adjusted basis, FedEx earned $5.01 a share, better than the $4.85 forecast by analysts.
Revenue climbed to $17.8bn from $17.3bn, roughly in line with Wall Street’s estimate.

The US and North Korea have held discussions about a third summit between President Donald Trump and Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, according to South Korean president Moon Jae-in.
Mr Moon said the US and North Korea had held “behind-the-scenes talks” about a meeting between the two leaders since their February summit in Hanoi, which collapsed after both sides remained far apart over denuclearisation.
He said Seoul and Pyongyang had also held talks via “diverse channels” to help facilitate arranging a third summit.
The White House declined to comment.
Mr Trump this week said he would meet Mr Kim “at some point”, but there has been no talk about preparations.
A US official said there were no plans for Mr Trump to meet Mr Kim during his trip to Asia this week.
Mr Trump will spend two days in South Korea this weekend after he attends the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan.
In a written response to questions from a group of news agencies, Mr Moon said there had been “considerable headway made in the peace process on the Korean peninsula”.
“The resumption of negotiations between North Korea and the United States will take it to the next level. I believe everything has now fallen into place for that to happen,” he wrote.
While Mr Moon expressed optimism that the US and North Korea were moving in the right direction, talks between the US and North Korean officials had ground to a halt since the Hanoi summit.
Expectations for progress declined further after Pyongyang last month tested short-range ballistic missiles for the first time since 2017.
Mr Trump has played down the significance of the tests, which his aides said violated UN sanctions.
In defending his stance, Mr Trump has also touted the fact that Pyongyang has not conducted any nuclear tests recently.
Mr Trump recently wrote to Mr Kim after receiving what he called a “beautiful” letter from the North Korean leader, in one sign that relations between the two sides might be improving after four months of almost no contact.
Mr Kim on Sunday said he had received a letter from Mr Trump that had “excellent content”.
The first summit between the leaders, in Singapore, came after they exchanged a series of letters over months.
Yet analysts remain wary over the chances of significant near-term progress given the complexities of both unwinding the international economic sanctions regime and the dismantling of North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.
The Hanoi summit failed because North Korea proposed an incremental process whereby small steps towards denuclearisation would be rewarded with the gradual removal of sanctions.
Mr Trump however insisted that any agreement should involve Pyongyang ending its entire nuclear weapons programme and giving up its existing arsenal before any relief from sanctions could be given.
Most experts believe that Mr Kim would be unwilling to agree to US demands because that would mean he would lose all leverage.
The CIA has also said it believes that Mr Kim has no intention of getting rid of all the elements of his nuclear programme.
Mr Trump will hold a summit with Mr Moon on Sunday after both leaders attend the G20.
Stephen Biegun, the US special envoy for North Korea, is scheduled to meet officials in Seoul on Thursday.

Europe’s increasingly foreign-owned football clubs are becoming top players in outward direct investment.
In March, a delegation from Real Madrid CF met Iraq’s prime minister in Baghdad to talk about setting up a Real Madrid Academy and plans for schools that feature football training as part of a general education.
The $23.6m project is one example of an unprecedented wave of investment by European clubs into emerging markets, especially in Asia.
Last year, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich, PSG, AFC Ajax, FC Dynamo Brest, City Football Group and Bundesliga International made 18 separate investments worldwide for a total of $380m, according to fDi Markets, an FT data service that has monitored cross-border greenfield investment since 2003.
Three projects went to the US and the remainder to EMs: China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Belarus and Slovakia, for a total of $364m.
European clubs have funnelled roughly $500m to EMs in greenfield projects since 2013, and about $100m to the US.
Investment started slowly, at an average of three projects totalling $27m a year between 2013 and 2017.
There was a sharp pick-up last year and early data for 2019 suggest the money has continued to flow, with six investments into EMs between January and April.
One reason is the recent rise of football academies.
Until last year, European clubs focused on sales and marketing projects abroad, with the aim of building fan bases overseas and developing commercial activities, the data from fDi Markets show.
From last year, however, the type of investment has changed categorically, to focus on training and education in the form of football schools and academies.
The biggest force for change has been China.
Chinese tycoons shook the football world with a $2.5bn spending spree on European clubs between 2015 and 2017.
Today, several dozen European clubs across the continent’s top leagues are partly or wholly owned by Chinese businessmen, including Atlético Madrid and Manchester City.
Under President Xi Jinping, who professes a love for the beautiful game, the government has led the growth of football in China, providing financial and policy support with the stated aim of qualifying for, hosting and winning the Fifa World Cup in the coming decades.
However, the flow of Chinese money into European football has been curbed since late 2017, with a shift of investment to the development of Chinese players through improved youth coaching and training facilities.
The government aims to set up 50,000 football academies by 2025.
European clubs have responded.
Inter Milan took a lead in conjunction with its Chinese parent Suning Sports Group, building football academies in seven Chinese cities in 2018, according to fDi Markets.
The club also runs at least 59 school programmes for players aged four to 18.
Toulouse FC is also advancing quickly into this space, while Bayern Munich and Real Betis Balompié set up academies in China in 2019, showing that non-Chinese owned European clubs have spotted the opportunity, too.
In 2014, Real Madrid was one of the first movers in China, partnering with Guangzhou Evergrande, the world’s largest football academy, to provide a coaching programme with 24 Real Madrid coaches.
Deloitte predicts that a team from China’s Super League has the “highest chance” of becoming one of the world’s top revenue-earning clubs in the next decade or so.
However, the trend of investing in football academies overseas extends beyond China, as shown by Real Madrid in Iraq.
This year, PSG set up academies in Qatar, Turkey and Malaysia, while Inter Milan set up in Belarus and Slovakia in 2018.
More European clubs will follow suit as the number of clubs owned by individuals or companies from EMs grows.
Arsenal, Manchester City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Bournemouth, Chelsea and Leicester City in the English Premier League, plus at least eight clubs in the second-division Championship, are partially or fully in the hands of such owners.
Many EMs offer potentially lucrative and largely untapped opportunities in football.
Outward investment from Europe looks set to accelerate, especially as growth in the sport’s digital audience continues a recent burst of pace.

Big tech groups such as Facebook could “rapidly establish a dominant position” in global finance and pose a potential threat to competition, financial stability and social welfare, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
The BIS, the central bank for central banks, said regulators worldwide may need to “revamp” rules to deal with the structural changes being brought about by entrants that control “key digital platforms” such as ecommerce sites and social networks.
The warnings, in an extract from BIS’s upcoming annual review published on Sunday, highlight regulator unease after Facebook last week outlined its desire to upend the financial system through the launch of Libra, a “global digital currency”.
Facebook has touted Libra as a way to improve financial inclusion for the 1.7bn people without access to bank accounts, while Amazon — which lends to companies that sell on its marketplace — has said it wants to fill the gap left by banks that are increasingly unwilling to lend to small businesses.
The report acknowledged those potential benefits, suggesting that tech groups’ superior customer data could lead to more efficient decision-making and lower barriers to the provision of financial services.
However, it also cautioned that misuse of that data could have “adverse economic and welfare effects”.
Companies could, for example, exclude high-risk groups from socially desirable insurance markets, or price discriminate by working out the maximum rate a borrower would be willing to pay for a loan.
Hyun Song Shin, BIS economic adviser and head of research, said: “The aim should be to respond to big tech’s entry into financial services so as to benefit from the gains while limiting the risks.
“Public policy needs to build on a more comprehensive approach that draws on financial regulation, competition policy and data privacy regulation.”
Regulators responded immediately to news of Libra’s launch, with the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, telling a meeting of central bankers in Portugal that if Facebook was successful in attracting users “it would instantly become systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulation”.
The G7 nations, central banks and International Monetary Fund are planning to work together on a high-level forum that will examine the risks of such currencies and try to work out how to ensure they have sufficient controls against money laundering.
The BIS report said that such co-ordination between national and international authorities would be “crucial”.

Nike cancelled the sale of a line of limited-edition sports shoes in China after their Japanese designer expressed support for protests against a proposed bill that would enable extradition to the mainland, highlighting the political risks for western businesses operating in the country.
Chinese retailers halted sales of the trainers designed by Undercover, the studio of Japanese designer Jun Takahashi, after it posted a picture of protesters with the slogan “no extradition to China” on its Instagram account earlier this month.
The post provoked a backlash from Chinese Instagram users, who use VPN software to access the platform as it is blocked on the mainland. Undercover deleted the post, which it said was an “individual opinion” posted by mistake.
YYSports, a Chinese retailer owned by Hong Kong-listed Pou Sheng International, Nike’s strategic partner in China, said in a social media post that it had received an “urgent notice” from the US sportswear maker resulting in the cancellation of the shoe’s release on June 14.
Other Chinese vendors withdrew the shoes from sale without explanation.
Online vendor Douniu said it had removed all products related to the Undercover brand due to “special reasons”, without giving details.
Nike did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The controversy is unlikely to have a significant impact on Nike’s revenues in China, as it was swiftly dealt with and the shoes were designed as a collector’s item rather than a mass-market product, said a person close to the company.
But the issue highlights the difficulties multinational companies face adjusting to political sensitivities in China without being seen by consumers in more politically liberal countries as yielding to authoritarian demands.
Nike has marketed itself as a champion of social causes.
This included last year hiring Colin Kaepernick, an American football player who was part of a protest movement against US police brutality against African-Americans, as the face of a high-profile advertising campaign.
Last year, German carmaker Mercedes-Benz apologised to Chinese consumers twice after using a quote from the Dalai Lama in a post on its Instagram account.
Beijing views the exiled spiritual Tibetan leader as a dangerous separatist.
US clothing retailer Gap was also targeted last year after a post on Weibo, the Chinese social media network, that showed T-shirts with a map of China that did not include Taiwan, south Tibet and the South China Sea.
Gap issued an apology.
Nike and its rival Adidas have experienced rapid growth in China in recent years as exercise becomes more popular along with “athleisure” fashion.
Nike generated sales of $5.1bn in greater China in 2018, up 18 per cent from the previous year in currency-adjusted terms.
Some Chinese media called for a ban on the Undercover brand.
“Making money from Chinese people and doing things which hurt China, Undercover you are disgusting . . . please get out of China,” said an article published by Sneaker News, a Chinese website.

Shares in Chinese down jacket maker Bosideng tumbled on Monday in the wake of a short seller’s report.
Bosideng shares fell 24.8 per cent on Monday morning before the company announced a trading halt, on track for the biggest fall one-day fall on record.
The company said the report by Bonitas Research contained “untrue and misleading information” and that it would release a clarification announcement.
Bonitas had questioned the company’s revenues and profits.
The clothing retailer opened a UK flagship store in 2012, but closed the Mayfair outlet in early 2017 citing Brexit-related economic uncertainty.
Bosideng is Bonitas’ latest Hong Kong-listed target.
Bonitas was launched last year by Matthew Wichert, the co-founder of short-seller Glaucus Research.

US companies are turning to their lawyers for help in containing the costs of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on goods from China, looking for legal loopholes to help avoid or reduce duties without shifting production to other countries.
Law firms and consultants say they are being inundated with requests for assistance from importers seeking to use provisions such as the “321 de minimis” rule, which allows goods worth less than $800 to be shipped to the US without being subject to tariffs.
Corporate advisers caution that the attempts to reduce costs are not without their risks.
Money can be clawed back — and top executives held accountable — if US authorities clamp down on a particular tariff avoidance method, they say.
“Customs in the end typically holds the highest officer in the company responsible, so it’s not just you that’s engaging in these activities, it’s also your CEO,” said Geoff Pollak, leader of Alvarez & Marsal’s global supply chain practice.
US companies have issued a series of warnings about the economic fallout from the trade war ahead of a meeting planned this week between Mr Trump and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at the G20 summit in Osaka.
In addition to billions of dollars in charges imposed on Chinese imports, the Trump administration is threatening levies on an additional $300bn of goods, increasing pressure on companies with longstanding relationships with Chinese suppliers.
Jason Bonfig, chief merchandising officer at electronics retailer Best Buy, told a recent hearing in Washington: “In many leading products, there is no practical substitute made outside of China in the near term.”
As a result, companies have been encouraged to “look at every possible way to reduce their tariff exposure” within the rules, said Edward Steiner, senior director for international trade and governmental relations at Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg.
“The private sector is being incentivised to be creative in their mitigation strategy.”
Steve Orava, chair of King & Spalding’s international trade practice, said: “Companies have found ways to manoeuvre around some of the China tariffs, being creative and sophisticated in how they address the restrictions.”
Amy Magnus, director of customs affairs and compliance at Deringer, said importers have expressed particular interest in the “321 de minimis” rule. The limit on goods that can be imported without being subject to tariffs was increased to $800 from $200 three years ago. But only one shipment per customer is permitted each day.
“A lot of people are asking more questions about how this can work for them,” she said. “It is already happening now, and it will be happening a whole lot more if wave four [the threatened tariffs on more Chinese goods] comes in.”
Rules on “first sale valuation” provide another way to curb import duties.
Tariffs are levied on the value of the good being imported, yet companies may be able to persuade customs officials to assess the levy on a lower valuation if the goods had been purchased at a lower price further down the supply chain.
“If you’re talking about large volume, you’re talking about large savings,” Mr Steiner said.
US exporters can also use “duty drawback” to get tariff relief on goods that subsequently leave the country.
John Garrison, chief executive of listed manufacturer Terex, told a recent investor conference the mechanism had allowed the Connecticut-based company to manage the direct impact of the tariffs “quite successfully”.
So-called “origin engineering” is another technique.
Goods are typically considered to have come from a country if they have been “substantially transformed” there.
Companies may be able to adjust parts of their production to argue the goods originated outside China.
Chicago-based Methode Electronics has been trialing manufacturing locations and component suppliers outside China.
However, Ron Tsoumas, chief financial officer, told investors last week that it gets fairly complicated from a tariff standpoint on what constitutes “material transformation”.
Companies can also manage tariff expenses by using facilities known as “bonded warehouses”, where imported goods can be stored without payments being due. Duties are levied only when the goods leave the building.
The warehouses can be used either to manage cash flows by spreading the duties over time, or to pay lower rates if tariffs are reduced at a later date.
Lawyers said that none of the customs strategies offered a panacea, however. “Some of those can work well, some are a bit burdensome,” said Mr Orava. To exploit them successfully, he added, companies often needed to take up “a lot of internal resources, to make sure they’re fully compliant” with the rules.

North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un has praised a letter he received from US President Donald Trump, raising hopes that stalled negotiations on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula could restart despite recent tensions.
Mr Kim said the letter was “of excellent content”, according to North Korea’s state-run news agency KCNA, which did not provide further details about what Mr Trump had written.
“Appreciating the political judging faculty and extraordinary courage of President Trump, Kim Jong Un said that he would seriously contemplate the interesting content,” KCNA reported.
News of the correspondence follows Mr Trump’s announcement earlier this month that he had received a “beautiful letter” from Mr Kim.
Sarah Sanders, White House press secretary, confirmed that Mr Trump had written to the North Korean leader, saying “correspondence between the two leaders has been ongoing”.
Talks between Washington and Pyongyang have been stalled since the second summit between Mr Trump and Mr Kim fell apart in Hanoi in February.
The US had pushed for a deal that would see international economic sanctions eased only if Pyongyang ended its entire nuclear weapons programme and gave up existing nuclear weapons.
Mr Kim had insisted on a step-by-step process whereby sanctions would be removed incrementally as reward for smaller steps toward denuclearisation.
Mr Kim in April warned he would wait only until “till the end of this year” for the US to change its approach.
This week Mr Kim met Xi Jinping, China’s president, and reiterated his country was awaiting moves by the US to break the deadlock.
North Korea last month launched a series of weapons tests, which included the first firing of short-range ballistic missiles since 2017, raising fears over increased hostilities.
Also in May, the US confirmed the 2018 seizure of a North Korean ship allegedly used to evade sanctions, drawing a rebuke from Pyongyang and further ratcheting up tension.
Mr Trump did not provide further details at the time of the “very warm, very nice letter” he received from Mr Kim earlier this month, but South Korean President Moon Jae-in later said it included a “very interesting part that President Trump did not announce”.
Jina Kim, an analyst at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, said the correspondence from Mr Kim suggested the North Korean leader wanted to keep dialogue “alive” and “wanted to know what the US can offer”, despite the failure at Hanoi.
The latest communication between the two leaders comes ahead of Mr Trump’s trip to the G20 meeting in Japan followed by his planned summit with Mr Moon in Seoul.
John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, said it was “not inconceivable” Mr Kim and Mr Trump could also hold a third meeting in the demilitarised zone between South Korea and North Korea — the location of two meetings between Mr Kim and Mr Moon in 2018.
Van Jackson, a former Pentagon official, said while Mr Trump’s letter may have conveyed a willingness for a third summit with the North Korean leader, Mr Kim was not likely to agree “unless Trump's letter puts sanctions relief on the table unilaterally”.
“As long as the exchange of letters continues, Kim Jong Un will continue advancing his nuclear and missile capabilities short of a full-blown long-range missile test without consequence. These letters are Kim's way of pacifying Trump despite a gradually worsening situation on the ground,” said Mr Jackson.

Washington’s decision to blacklist Huawei, preventing US companies from buying its products, may be a death sentence for China’s leading technology group.
It is hard to see how Huawei can survive without a negotiated settlement between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.
But this fight is about more than the fate of one company.
After 30 years of globalisation, we now face the very real prospect that an economic iron curtain may descend.
Technology has become a core problem in the US-China relationship, blurring the lines between economic competitiveness and national security.
The battle is about whose economy will drive the technology of the future and set the standards for it.
These issues are among the most intractable because they strike at the core of each country’s national security and competitiveness, and there is no playbook for resolving them. Increasingly, the west and China will compete over whose technologies and standards will become dominant. The battle could fragment the world as some regions choose Chinese products and standards while others opt for infrastructure that is dependent on US and western technology and standards. One likely source of friction is the competition to build and deploy 5G architecture, which will underpin a vast array of commercial and military technologies.
Mutual efforts to exclude one another’s technologies from national supply chains would break the global innovation ecosystem.
For strictly military systems, there is of course a straightforward national security basis for exclusion.
But few hardware or software systems are straightforwardly military any more.
The US faces a twofold problem.
First, other countries are unlikely to sever their technology relationships with China.
A full-blown US push to freeze out applications with widespread or beneficial commercial uses is likely to flounder when other countries refuse to go along.
Some wealthy democracies may follow the US and seek to strip Chinese equipment out of their backbone technological systems.
But most, and maybe all, developing economies will not and neither will some US allies.
America also risks isolating itself.
The Huawei supply ban will reverberate well beyond China because it sets a precedent.
Others may stop doing business with American companies and relying on US suppliers rather than run the risk that Washington might step in and inflict great harm on them by terminating the commercial relationship.
Understandably, Americans abhor China’s history of pervasive technology theft and forced technology transfer.
They also rightly dislike the Chinese models of internet governance and regulation.
But innovation cannot be separated from competitiveness.
Balkanising technology could harm global innovation, hurting the competitiveness not just of Chinese firms but also of US companies around the world.
US policymakers are now focused on finding ways to hurt China and weaken its technological progress in advanced and emerging industries such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing.
But they aren’t focused enough on what that effort might mean for America’s own technological progress and economic competitiveness, both of which underpin our national security.
As much as business and innovation leaders welcome the actions the US government is now taking to protect vital new technologies, they worry that government bureaucrats will introduce controls without fully considering the impact on America’s global position and its access to some of the world’s largest and fastest-growing markets.
Detaching the US from Chinese entrepreneurs, scientists and inventors — and the ecosystem in which they foster innovation — will undermine America’s own ability to innovate.
China and other countries will continue to jointly make progress by working with one another.
At worst, we could sequester so much important technology in the US that American companies would no longer be able to participate in the international research collaborations and supply chains that fuel the fastest-growing industries.
The US would also lose its place as the world’s most attractive investment destination.
The whole world will be watching when Messrs Trump and Xi attend the G20 meeting in Osaka on Friday.
Business and government leaders everywhere hope the two leaders can reboot the trade negotiations and drive them to a successful conclusion.
But as arduous as these talks have been, this challenge pales in comparison to managing the looming technology competition.
This is the paramount challenge for US economic and national security because innovation is one of America’s defining strengths.
We need to protect it — but without erecting an economic iron curtain that weakens us by closing us off from other innovative economies and people.
The writer, a former US Treasury secretary, chairs the Paulson Institute

The pace at which China is selling its holdings of US Treasuries has accelerated dramatically since the beginning of 2018.
Against the backdrop of the escalating US-China trade war and other protectionist measures, the move has sparked concerns that China is actively weaponising its position as the largest foreign creditor to the US government.
The fear is that such selling — especially at a time when foreign demand for US Treasuries has flatlined — will result in higher US interest rates, pushing up borrowing costs.
China is unlikely to use its $1tn plus of US Treasuries as a trade war weapon, however, because it would be financially destructive to both sides with China, ironically, bearing most of the burden.
Indeed what's also holding China back from diverting its massive, albeit declining, stock of savings is the simple fact that there is no market as deep, liquid and safe as that of US Treasuries.
First let's examine the issue of demand.
While China is on pace to run a small current account deficit this year after decades of posting a sizeable current account surplus, its appetite for foreign assets remains elevated.
What's more, at 42 per cent, foreign exchange reserves comprise the predominant share of these assets, as Shweta Singh at TS Lombard points out in a recent note:
Clearly, China's need for a place to park its savings isn't going away any time soon, even if the country's external position is getting smaller.
It is on this supply point that China runs in to trouble.
No market can compete with the US Treasury market when it comes to size and stability.
As Singh shows in the chart below, the amount of outstanding US public debt securities is nearly double that of the next largest market, the Euro area, as well as the third largest, Japan. To boot, it is over three times the size of China's, which sits in fourth place at roughly $5tn:
In terms of stability, there is also little competition. Per Singh, the number of AAA-rated sovereigns across the euro area has declined since the financial crisis to the extent that safe-rated debt amounts to just 10 per cent — or $2tn — of Euro area's GDP. Over the same period, the amount of sovereign debt with this high credit rating has surged in the US. It now totals $18tn, or more than 70 per cent of its GDP:
And then there's the fact that the US dollar is the most widely used currency in the world from an invoicing, financing and reserves basis which means it remains the destination of choice for not only China, but the majority of economies as well.
Despite efforts from both Europe and China, the dollar's dominance has yet to be seriously challenged.
So until that changes, and a viable alternative to the US Treasury market takes shape, China has little choice but to stick to more traditional trade war weapons.

A debilitating cyber attack against Iran reportedly ordered by the US president as military tension spiked late last week is a clear example of the way modern warfare is changing.
The cyber attack was aimed at disabling Tehran’s missile systems ahead of air strikes against three unnamed targets, which Donald Trump called off at the last-minute.
Iranian officials did not react to the cyber attack claims reported by US media on Sunday, but such tactics would underline how any conflict with Iran is unlikely to take the form of previous American-led military interventions in the Middle East.
“Overthrowing the Iranian regime through military force as the US did in Iraq and Afghanistan is completely off the table,” said Seth Jones, political scientist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank. “There is no appetite for that from Trump or any of his cabinet.”
Instead, targeted strikes against Iranian missile batteries and radar targets showed the US would follow a similar playbook to air strikes on Syria in 2017 and 2018, and missile attacks on radar sites operated by Iran-aligned Houthi forces in 2016.
“Look at the options the US has taken against Syria and in Yemen,” said Henry Boyd, analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank. “These could include operative strikes against radar sites — something that indicates the Americans can and will hold the Iranians responsible for their actions and that they can inflict damage on the Iranian military.”
The US has deployed cyber attacks against Iran before.
Along with Israel it was widely believed to be behind the Stuxnet computer virus that attacked and destroyed centrifuges at an uranium enrichment facility at Iran’s Natanz nuclear site.
Yet one challenge with using cyber attack against Iran’s military targets would be in identifying their effectiveness, said Mr Jones.
“It [also] does not have the same sort of response publicly that a more direct [military] response would have done,” he added.
The question for military analysts is whether such tactics can deliver the intended message to the leadership in Tehran and alleviate the pressure in a rapidly escalating crisis in the Gulf.
Tension remains high following a series of incidents that have threatened to unleash a new wave of instability, including the downing of a $130m US surveillance drone and attacks on tankers in the Straits of Hormuz that the Americans have blamed on Iran.
Over the past two months the Pentagon has deployed the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike fleet, consisting of up to 70 attack aircraft, and at least three Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers to the area.
It has also sent B52 bombers to its air base in nearby Qatar and has F35A and F15 fighter jets based in the United Arab Emirates.
In addition, the US navy has its fifth fleet in Bahrain and marines from the 22nd expeditionary unit are stationed aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge.
Yet such traditional military force may be of limited use against an opponent that will seek to use its proxy forces and powerful ballistic missile capabilities, rather than enter a head-on land war against US forces.
The IISS’s annual analysis of global armed forces concludes that Iran’s 125,000-strong Islamic Revolutionary Guards exerted “significant military influence via a range of regional allies and proxies” including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hizbollah in Lebanon.
The risk for the US is that by attacking military targets in Iran, it provokes the Revolutionary Guards and its allies to hit US interests in the region, or Israel.
“If you consider where Iran has placed its money since the 1980s, it has not been in building strong, conventional forces,” said Mr Jones.
“Their army, air force and navy are relatively weak and not well funded,” he added citing years of US sanctions and budget cuts.
According to a research paper by the Brookings Institution published this year, Iran has an arsenal of 15 different types of ballistic missile with ranges from 200km to 6000km.
The country also has a new anti-ship missile which it fired from a submarine in tests in February.
Faced with such threats, analysts said the US may have to constrain itself to limited “kinetic” responses, such as air strikes, more strategic cyber attacks, or economic force.
“My sense of this at the moment is that the US is more willing to fight this through sanctions, not even indirect military force,” said Mr Jones.
Analysts also noted that Iran had stepped up its offensive cyber capabilities.
Cybersecurity experts have blamed Iran for a big cyber attack in 2012 against Saudi Arabian companies using a virus known as Shamoon.
A similar attack was launched last year, experts say.
“There is no question that there has been an increase in Iranian cyber activity,” said Christopher Krebs, director of the Department for Homeland Security’s cyber security agency in comments reported by US media over the weekend. “Iranian actors and their proxies are not just your garden variety run-of-the-mill data thieves. These are the guys that come in and they burn the house down.”

Migration consultants have seen a sharp rise in interest from Hong Kong citizens following recent mass protests against a controversial proposal that would allow extradition to China.
John Hu, director of John Hu Migration Consulting, said his office has been fielding 100 calls a day from people enquiring about gaining citizenship abroad — almost three times the number of calls he was receiving before the protests started.
Even before the recent surge, Mr Hu’s consultancy said he had seen a “constant” increase in inquiries since the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests calling for universal suffrage in the Chinese territory blocked roadways for more than three months.
“Certainly the political pressure on Hong Kong citizens has activated them to consider immigration overseas. In the past five years, we’ve been having double-digit growth in our sales volume,” he said, adding that the top choices are Australia, Canada, the UK and US with increasing interest in other European countries.
Concerns over Beijing’s growing influence in Hong Kong spurred Henry Lau, 43, a lifestyle journalist, to apply for an investment visa for his family to move to Prince Edward Island on Canada’s east coast in October.
He says he fears Hong Kong’s education system is becoming more like that of China’s and wants to ensure his children learn the values he grew up with.
“What’s happened in these past few months was foreseeable,” he said, referring to the government’s attempt to push through the bill and the huge public condemnation it attracted. “I love my home so much, I love Hong Kong so much, I love my friends so much, but when you have your next generation, you have a responsibility to take care of them and to deliver the best environment.”
Canada, which is one of the most popular destination countries according to the migration consultants, approved 1,525 residency applications from Hong Kong in 2018, a 12 per cent increase over the previous year, when 1,360 residency applications were approved, according to government data. The number was unchanged from 2016 but represented a huge jump on the 895 approved in 2015.
Taiwan has drawn increasing interest in recent years  through its introduction of a more affordable investor visa.
Official statistics show 231 people from Hong Kong secured permanent residency there through investment visas in 2018, up more than 20 per cent from a year earlier and a steep rise on the 28 people who secured permanent residency in 2015.
Hong Kong government figures show the number of people applying for police background checks for applications to study or reside abroad rose 4 per cent in 2018, the third consecutive year in which there had been a rise.
The recent upswing in interest is different to the “crazy” rush to leave ahead of the 1997 handover from British to Chinese sovereignty when people would queue up for help to move to countries they knew little about, said Margaret Chau, of Goldmax Immigration Consulting. But Ms Chau said she had noticed an increase in interest since June 9 and since 2012, Goldmax has seen business grow 20-30 per cent growth each year.

Is it a bubble if it does not burst?
China’s housing prices sometimes appear unstoppable.
A Beijing home costs the average household up to 50 years of income, double what it was 15 years ago.
Prices in May were up 11 per cent, continuing gains for 49 straight months.
The Chinese government is torn between controlling prices and preventing a crash.
So far, it has been unable to rein in prices.
Limits on lending and sales bans have been offset by recent credit easing.
Its push to control prices by encouraging renting, instead of buying, was met with little enthusiasm.
Large developers stand to gain the most from this tug of war.
Many debt-laden Chinese property developers look to be in bad shape.
Eighteen of them have issued $3bn worth of US dollar bonds this month at up to double the cost of borrowing at home.
And while prices rose in May, property sales by floor area, an important indicator of demand, dropped 5.5 per cent.
But in an uncertain market, property purchasers are drawn to developers that are perceived to be too big to fail.
Vanke reported a steep rise in sales to Rmb58bn （$8.5bn） in May.
Evergrande says its contracts totalled Rmb53.53 bn that month, up 28 per cent on the same period last year.
With the rental base growing along with new home sales, revenue growth is expected to exceed a third this year at the biggest developers, which also include China Resources Land.
But share valuations are depressed by debt levels and difficulties accessing the local bond market.
Evergrande’s shares, for example, trade at 4.8 times forward earnings, 27 per cent lower than their 10-year average.
Obvious dangers are often ignored.
In March, the financial stability chief of China’s central bank described real estate as such a “grey rhino” risk to the financial sector.
But the sector’s importance is potentially a source of comfort.
Housing market is a big part of economic growth.
Even as debt piles on, investors can bet on government support when the going gets tough.

Last year Lee Hak-jae, a Lotte executive, locked himself inside an office in China for two days as local staff gathered outside, demanding answers over compensation.
Today, surrounded by confectionery and maps of south-east Asia in his Seoul office, he and his company look to a future outside China.
Lotte’s experience is an increasingly common reality for South Korean businesses.
“I’m relieved I can now forget about the bitter experiences in China and move on to focus on new markets,” Mr Lee, vice-president in charge of overseas business development at Lotte Mart, told the Financial Times.
Lotte’s forced retreat from China is a warning of the dangers faced by foreign companies that draw Beijing’s wrath.
The retail giant — now targeting growth in Indonesia and Vietnam — is also a harbinger of a wave of Korean conglomerates quitting or reducing their reliance on one of the world’s biggest markets.
“A lot of the companies that were massively optimistic about China three or four years ago, now more than half of them are talking about reducing their exposure, both as a market and a manufacturing base,” said Peter Kim, an investment strategist with Mirae Asset Daewoo in Seoul.
Several large South Korean cosmetics and other retail groups have trimmed their Chinese operations or left the market over the past two years.
Samsung Electronics this month confirmed production cuts at its last smartphone factory in China, having shut sites in Tianjin and Shenzhen in 2018.
Last week, carmaker Kia said it would rent out one of its three Chinese plants, while its parent Hyundai was considering cutbacks.
Major manufacturing groups are trying to retain some production in China to meet local demand, but increasingly they are looking to build new capacity elsewhere.
Display maker LG Display and industrial giant Posco are among those to announce billions of dollars in new investments in Vietnam over the past year.
South Korea is the country’s largest foreign investor with registered capital of $62.5bn at the end of 2018, according to the Vietnamese government.
Companies, including Lotte’s chemical division, are also building new facilities in the US, as a hedge against Washington’s trade war with Beijing.
Analysts expect the trend to accelerate as the trade dispute drags further on Chinese growth, analysts said.
But the change also reflected the rise of Chinese competitiveness and Beijing’s drive for domestic-led growth.
Lotte Mart was hit by boycotts in 2017 after China lashed out at South Korea for deploying a new US missile defence system.
The company’s retail operations ground to a standstill and later that year it announced its exit from the market.
The company reported losses from China of $1.7bn in the 18 months from January 2017.
However, while the 2017 boycotts were the final catalyst, Lotte, like many South Korean groups, had for years struggled to build a profitable business.
“Although sales in China were much bigger, we were actually suffering losses in 2016,” Mr Lee said. “But our businesses in Vietnam and Indonesia are much more profitable and have higher growth potential.”
South Korean companies attributed their challenges in China to rising labour costs, price competition and the burden of government regulation, but many also underestimated their local rivals, analysts said.
“The speed of Chinese companies catching up to global peers is the part that has surprised Korean companies the most,” Mr Kim said.
Seok Gil Park, South Korea chief economist at JPMorgan, said a shift in policy from Beijing targeting inward-oriented growth could see Korea’s role in the market further reduced.
“There will be less integrated foreign influence on that front,” Mr Park said. “If China’s fiscal stimulus is through domestic credit and real estate sectors, then Korea’s role in that market will be smaller than before,” Mr Park said.
China still accounts for more than a quarter of South Korea’s exports and companies with products that cannot be easily substituted would continue to fare better.
“For example, Korea’s memory chips are now a key part of many industrial goods and have a competitive edge against the others,” Mr Park said.
The moves raised questions over whether south-east Asia can match China’s cheap and massive labour force and giant consumer class which have fuelled global growth for decades.
Mr Lee, the Lotte executive, said while the company encountered less “cultural resistance” in Indonesia and Vietnam, it was now pursuing a less aggressive, profit-focused strategy.
“We had in-depth discussions about which markets can replace China,” he said. “But we learnt a lesson in China that growth in scale does not necessarily guarantee sustainable growth.”

Carrefour, Europe’s largest retailer, took a decisive step towards exiting China on Sunday as it sold the majority of its struggling business in the country.
The French group said that it had agreed to sell 80 per cent of Carrefour China to Suning.com, a Chinese retailer with more than 8,881 stores in more than 700 cities.
The all-cash deal worth €620m values the Chinese business at €1.4bn, including debt, and is set to close by the end of the year.
The agreement with Suning.com also gives Carrefour “several liquidity windows to sell its remaining 20 per cent stake in Carrefour China”, the retailer added.
Carrefour entered the Chinese market in 1995 and operates a network of 210 hypermarkets and 24 convenience stores in the country.
Last year, the Chinese business generated net sales of €3.6bn and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of €66m.
However, analysts at HSBC flagged in February that China was a tough spot for Carrefour, and its chief executive Alexandre Bompard, who joined the group in 2017.
“China remains difficult with like-for-like [sales] down 5.9 per cent [in 2018] including a deterioration in the fourth quarter,” which saw like-for-like sales down 6.2 per cent, HSBC said in a note to clients.
After the deal was announced, Carrefour told Reuters that talks over a minority stake sale to Suning.com’s rival, Chinese tech giant Tencent, had ended.
However, a spokesperson added that a “strategic business partnership” with Tencent remained in place.
Carrefour launched the partnership with Tencent and Yonghui in January 2018 as part of an overhaul designed to boost growth.
In February this year, Carrefour — which is engaged in a price war with domestic rivals such as E. Leclerc, Casino and Auchan — lifted its targets for cost savings as part of a transformation plan running to 2022.
The chain has been trying to reduce its dependency on hypermarkets and ramp up its convenience and e-commerce formats in the face of competition from German discounters and online groups such as Amazon.
The retailer’s share price has climbed 14 per cent this year even though Nick Coulter, an analyst at Citi, said in a recent note that Carrefour was still “work in progress”.
“With cost savings underpinning margins in [2019] we view the initiatives to regain competitiveness in France positively, although we note the extended period of patience required by investors to move from a sustained period of earnings and free cash flow erosion to recovery,” said Mr Coulter.

A political gamble by Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan backfired spectacularly on Sunday as the opposition won a resounding victory in the repeat of an Istanbul mayoral election according to early results.
Ekrem Imamoglu, the opposition challenger in a race for control of Turkey’s biggest and most important city, had won the contest in a previous vote but was stripped of his narrow victory after claims of fraud by Mr Erdogan’s ruling party.
On Sunday, preliminary results showed that the 49-year-old former district major not only won the rerun of the vote but massively increased his majority.
“This amounts to everyone together opening a new page for Istanbul,” Mr Imamoglu said after the result became clear.
“Today 16 million Istanbul residents have renewed our faith in democracy and our trust in justice,” he added.
He described the result as a new chapter not only for Istanbul but for everyone in Turkey.
“It’s a new start,” he said
The second defeat will come as a crushing blow for Mr Erdogan, who has for years warned his party faithful that losing Istanbul means losing Turkey.
Mr Imamoglu won close to 54 per cent of the vote, compared to 45 per cent for Binali Yildirim, the former prime minister who stood for the ruling party, according to initial results published by the state-run Anadolu news agency.
In a televised speech, Mr Yildirim said that his opponent was in the lead and appeared to concede defeat.
“My opponent Ekrem Imamoglu is ahead. I congratulate him and wish him success,” Mr Yildirim said.
“An election means democracy. This election once again proves that democracy works extremely well and flawlessly in Turkey. The final results will be announced later. I hope these results will be fortuitous for Istanbul.”
Mr Imamoglu increased his lead in the city of 10.5m voters from less than 14,000 votes in the initial vote to more than 700,000.
Those figures were based on almost 98 per cent of ballot boxes, Anadolu said.
The former district mayor ran an upbeat campaign that highlighted the injustice that he says he and his supporters suffered when he was stripped of his original victory.
He promised to deliver better services to Istanbul’s 16m residents, and to cut corruption and waste.
Mr Erdogan’s party sought to echo Mr Imamoglu by striking a more positive tone than in its previous campaign, which was dominated by warnings about the threat of terrorism. It focused much of its energy on intensive door-to-door campaigning, trying to win over those who stayed at home in the first vote and seeking to persuade members of the country’s Kurdish minority to back them.
The Turkish president, who built his own political career on the back of winning Istanbul mayorship in 1994, must now add an insurgent opposition to the wealth of challenges that he is facing, including a struggling an economy and high tensions with the US.

Washington will impose fresh sanctions on Tehran as early as Monday, one of Donald Trump's senior aides said, warning Iran not to mistake US “prudence for weakness”.
Three days after Mr Trump aborted a mission to strike Iran in retaliation for its shooting down of an American surveillance drone, John Bolton, White House national security adviser, warned Iran against complacency.
“Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness,” he said in Jerusalem on Sunday after meeting Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “No one has granted them a hunting licence in the Middle East.”
Mr Trump ordered strikes on Iranian targets on Thursday but later said he aborted the mission because of estimates that 150 Iranians could die.
The reversal was backed by the Pentagon but opposed by Mr Bolton and Mike Pompeo, secretary of state.
In overruling his more hawkish advisers, Mr Trump has signaled that he will continue for the time being with his “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions that are designed to persuade Tehran to come to the negotiating table.
In an interview with NBC News, Mr Trump said on Sunday he was willing to enter into negotiations with Iran with “no pre-conditions”, but he added he would continue to put economic pressure on the Islamic republic until it decided it wanted to negotiate.
“Look, you can’t have nuclear weapons. And if you want to talk about it, good,” Mr Trump said. “Otherwise you can live in a shattered economy for a long time to come.”
In separate comments on Saturday, Mr Trump said he wanted to “Make Iran Great Again” as he appeared to hold out the same economic promise that he has made to North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme.
Mike Mullen, former chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said on Sunday he worried that events could “spin out of control”.
Asked whether Mr Bolton was pushing Mr Trump into a conflict with Iran, he said: “It appears that we are certainly headed in that direction. Certainly, John Bolton has that reputation”.
“My biggest concern is the president is running out of room, running out of options and, while rhetoric goes back and forth on how close we came to hitting Iran just the other day, that this thing could spin out of control,” Mr Mullen told ABC News. “And the last thing in the world we need right now is a war with Iran.”

Apple has warned that proposed tariffs on imports of iPhones and its other flagship products from China to the US would “tilt the playing field” in favour of its overseas rivals and dent its multibillion-dollar contribution to the American economy.
The iPhone maker’s stark warning is just one of hundreds of submissions to the US Trade Representative from global manufacturers, small businesses and individual Americans, many of them in vehement opposition to the Trump administration’s proposed rise in import duties.
In a letter that was made public on Thursday, Apple pressed the White House to abandon tariffs of up to 25 per cent on its products including iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as parts used in device repairs.
The extra duty, if passed on to consumers, could add hundreds of dollars to the cost of Apple’s high-end products.
“We urge the US government not to impose tariffs on these products,” Apple wrote in its letter to the USTR, as part of its consultation on the proposals.
Apple alluded to its Chinese rival Huawei as it warned that competitors who do not have a “significant presence in the US market” would “not be impacted” by the tariffs.
“A US tariff would therefore tilt the playing field in favour of our global competitors,” it said.
The letter follows a report from the Nikkei Asian Review this week that Apple has asked its suppliers to explore moving as much as 30 per cent of its production capacity out of China, as a result of the two countries’ escalating trade dispute.
But many US technology companies are unable to make such drastic changes to their supply chain, which could take years to complete.
The Consumer Technology Association, a trade group, warned that $167bn in annual imports from China among its members would be affected.
“It is not easy for CTA member companies to simply ‘move’ supply chains,” the organisation told USTR.
“No one wins a trade war and an escalating tariff fight will inflict immense damage on American businesses, workers and consumers.”
The tariffs would undermine efforts to increase access to digital technology and harm American companies’ ability to lead in emerging fields such as augmented and virtual reality, the CTA added.
In joint submission asking for a reprieve on laptop and tablet imports, Dell, HP, Intel and Microsoft said the proposals “threaten to disproportionately harm multiple US interests” but would “not address the underlying Chinese trade practices” that the USTR sought to remedy.
“These price rises will hit during peak holiday and back-to-school demand seasons,” the four tech groups added.
Individual submissions to the consultation voiced similar concerns.
Todd Gormick of San Clemente, California, a declared supporter of President Trump whose company makes children’s scooters, warned the tariffs “are likely to put our entire company of 100 people ‘Out of Business’ . . . producing in the USA isn't really an option”.
Apple said in its letter that it is “on track” to make a $350bn “direct contribution” to the American economy over five years, a target first disclosed last year following the passage of US tax reforms.
The Silicon Valley-based company, which says it is already the largest US corporate taxpayer, is opening new facilities across the country, including a new campus in Austin, Texas, and plans to add thousands of new jobs.
But Apple said those growth plans were now at risk.
“US tariffs on Apple’s products would result in a reduction of Apple’s US economic contribution,” it wrote.
The escalating trade war has already hit iPhone sales in China, Apple warned earlier this year.

“How many divisions does the Pope have?” was supposedly how Joseph Stalin dismissed the notion that the Vatican’s wishes should be taken into account.
The EU does not have many military divisions either, but it has something nearly as awesome.
Authority over the world’s largest market and one of its biggest central banks gives the bloc a commercial power matching that of the US and unrivalled by anyone else.
Yet Europe is either unaware of its own strength or fearful of wielding it.
Europeans’ basic instinct is still to treat trade and finance as means to mercantile ends — market access and predictable conditions for its businesses, and the jobs and incomes that are expected to follow.
The EU is disinclined to use its economic clout for self-consciously political goals, which would require a willingness to put at risk commercial opportunities to serve a greater priority.
This shopkeeper mentality is linked to Europe’s aversion to looking a changed America in the eye.
Many European leaders live in the hope that things will normalise when US president Donald Trump leaves office, and are wary of burning bridges by being too confrontational.
But it is a mistake to treat Trumpism as a temporary aberration.
Even if Americans change their president in 2020, what has happened once can happen again.
The foundations of the global rules-based order have been irreversibly weakened — by the US losing interest in it and by China trying to subject it to its own dominance.
From accepting that it is “Europe alone”, EU leaders must move to acting for “Europe first” — not in the Trumpist sense of defeating others in zero-sum games, but in fighting for a system in which all who share the bloc’s values can thrive.
That means making international economic policy with the explicit goal of shaping the global rules in Europe’s image.
It is in the sphere of trade that the EU comes closest to realising — in both senses of the word — its superpower potential.
It has moved towards imposing its own environmental, labour and investment-dispute rules in trade agreements.
It knows its regulatory preferences often spread through the “Brussels effect”, where other countries track the EU to spare their companies the cost of following more than one set of rules.
But Europe has more to gain by shifting further from a mostly mercantile trade policy towards a geostrategic one, which seeks to increase the European imprint on how the world is governed.
For example, it could align trade policy much more closely with climate policy.
The EU should not shy away from imposing carbon border taxes on imports from countries without domestic carbon levies as extensive as Europe’s own.
Trade policy should also reinforce the Brussels effect, extending further and more formally the writ of the EU’s regulatory authority.
Talks on the bloc’s future relationship with the UK, once Brexit happens, offer a great opportunity.
In her Chequers proposal, prime minister Theresa May came close to aligning the UK automatically and dynamically with EU trade and regulatory policy in return for frictionless trade in goods.
The position of the opposition Labour party comes even closer.
Such a model would not just cement Brussels’ authority on goods throughout the continent; it would also set up a useful structure for the wider neighbourhood.
Once a frictionless market for goods was established for Britain, Turkey, north Africa and the post-Soviet fringe could gradually be brought into it, with EU rulemaking providing stability, prosperity and a staging post for those wanting closer relations in the future.
Beyond trade, public investment can buy more geopolitical advantage than increased defence spending.
Beijing’s extraordinary power of attraction among the eastern and southern EU states that have signed up to its Belt and Road project is less a reflection of how much China offers — money for greenfield projects falls far short of the hype— than of how Europe’s own investment collapsed after the financial crisis.
Several candidates to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as European Commission president have called for “Marshall plan” levels of aid in neighbourhood countries, too.
A dramatic increase in geopolitically-minded investment spending should be a priority in the next seven-year EU budget.
Finally, the collapse of the Iran nuclear deal has illustrated Europe’s continued dependence on the dollar-denominated financial system.
To achieve geopolitical autonomy, Europe needs to establish the euro as a reserve currency with a fully self-contained global payment system.
To this end, the European Central Bank — which is legally mandated to support the EU’s “general economic policies” — can be instructed by EU leaders to issue long-term safe euro assets.
The US remains the unmatched military superpower.
But even it achieves as much through economic as through military pressure.
Until now its pressure on Iran has been financial — directly through sanctions and indirectly by threats to other countries that do not toe Washington’s line.
A similar power is Europe’s for the taking.
What it must find is the will to use it.

The US and China will come under pressure to ease trade tensions at the forthcoming G20 summit in Osaka as the Japanese presidency seeks to steer the world’s most powerful economies away from confrontation.
While the summit at the end of the month will be dominated by the US-China trade war, with Donald Trump of the US set to meet China’s Xi Jinping, the rest of the world is pushing back at both giants over practices that undermine the global trading system.
Officials familiar with the pre-G20 trade discussions say that China’s model of state capitalism and Washington’s unilateralism under Mr Trump — both features of their trade war — have been sources of friction and debate heading into the summit.
At a recent meeting of trade ministers, China was cornered on  industrial subsidies and  steel overcapacity while the US agreed to discuss dispute resolution at the World Trade Organization, according to three participants in the talks.
The conclusions and language from that meeting in Tsukuba, Japan, will shape the communique at the Osaka summit, offering a road map to ease global trade tensions — if Mr Trump and Mr Xi choose to embrace it.
“Rather than papering over the differences, we decided to make them clear,” said a senior Japanese official involved in the talks. “The G20 is a process of peer pressure. The essence of what we agreed in Tsukuba will be incorporated in Osaka.”
The trade talks in Tsukuba were overshadowed by a simultaneous meeting of G20 finance ministers.
However, participants say the trade talks were far more important to the Osaka summit.
New dynamics emerged: with the US and China so focused on their bilateral trade war, the rest of the G20 could turn up the heat on both sides.
China ended up isolated by 19 to one over the use of subsidies to give its industries a trade advantage.
That led to an unusual statement in the communique, which is supposed to represent a consensus, noting that “many members” want tougher rules.
Steel overcapacity was also China versus the rest until Saudi Arabia backed Beijing at the last minute, delaying the official communique, as the issue was moved to a separate chair’s statement.
However, Saudi Arabia only backed the G20 principle of consensus — not the substance — and will have to decide whether it is willing to play the spoiler again in Osaka.
“There was a big push on China to maintain the commitment on steel agreed at the last G20 summit,” said the EU official.
On other topics, the pressure was on the US. A major source of friction has been the fate of the WTO’s dispute resolution mechanism, which is in danger of collapse because the US is blocking the appointment of appellate judges. The US says the WTO judges have often exceeded their mandate and imposed new obligations on members.
Washington has been pushing for reform of the Geneva-based global trade body but thinks the G20 is the wrong forum to discuss dispute resolution.
In Tsukuba, it agreed to act on WTO reform “with a sense of urgency” and “consistent with the rules negotiated by the WTO members”.
The latter was seen as progress by officials from some other countries because it precludes any US demand for a return to the non-binding, pre-WTO system of dispute resolution.
“If this is confirmed by the leaders [in Osaka], it will be a major step towards resolving the current impasse,” said the Japanese official.
A western official involved in the G20 discussions said the important thing was that the US did not “go backwards at all” on the future of the WTO.
A US official said the WTO language simply restated its position staked out in Geneva.
While the Tsukuba meeting did not adopt past language on “fighting protectionism”, dropped at the G20 in Argentina last year, it came up with a new line that may be reused at the Osaka summit: the G20 will “strive to realise a free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment, to keep our markets open”.
In the chair’s statement — and thus not agreed by the US — there was tough language on the impact of trade wars. “The trade war between the US and China is still very heated,” said the Japanese official. “The concern among other G20 members is getting stronger.”
A western official agreed: “Japan found a hybrid way of picking up the consensus where it’s there . . . there’s no doubt that there are concerns in some quarters that tit-for-tat tariffs are an unsustainable way to keep on going.”

Narendra Modi’s overwhelming victory in India’s elections is an extraordinary personal achievement.
It confirms Mr Modi’s ascendancy over the world’s second most populous country and largest democracy.
It confirms the marginalisation of the Congress party, which had dominated Indian politics for most of the years after independence in 1947.
It confirms the rise of Hindu nationalism as an increasingly dominant ideology, in place of the secularism promulgated by the founders of independent India.
This is all very important.
But what might this election mean for the economy and economic reform?
Will we see the reformist Mr Modi unleashed, or more of the same?
The answer is likely to be the latter.
Alas, that may be a disaster.
It is rare for a leader to be more radical in the second term than in the first.
It is normal, too, for the traits of self-confident and charismatic leaders to become more pronounced.
Indeed, as we have seen with Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, they tend to become more autocratic.
Will Mr Modi prove to be another of this kind?
He is an autodidact who mistrusts India’s western-educated policy intellectuals.
He is a centraliser and has proved to be an interventionist more than a pro-market reformer.
But he is also prepared to take gambles.
Given his political success, it is hard to believe these traits will not become even stronger in this term.
Mr Modi’s first government did significant things, but they were not transformative.
One of his important contributions was to extend public provision of essential goods and services for the poor: cooking gas, toilets, electric power, housing, bank accounts and emergency medical insurance.
He also implemented two significant and long-discussed reforms: the insolvency and bankruptcy law and the generalised sales tax, or GST, though the implementation of both has brought significant problems.
The radical demonetisation of 2016 remains highly controversial.
But most informed observers believe it was a big mistake.
Far more radical action is now needed, for India confronts some big challenges.
The economy seems to be slowing significantly.
In a recent column, Shankar Acharya, former chief economic adviser to the Indian government, notes that growth in the last quarter of 2018-19 was 5.8 per cent, the slowest in 20 quarters.
Investment is also markedly weak.
The latest “periodic labour force survey” confirmed that “the employment situation in the nation was the worst in several decades, with just under half the working age population actually working or seeking work”.
Merchandise exports have stagnated since 2011-12.
The combined fiscal deficit of the central and state governments is now about 7 per cent of gross domestic product.
The challenge of resolving the “twin balance sheet” problem of non-performing assets of banks and unserviced debt obligation of companies remains significant, while a big new problem has emerged within nonbank finance companies.
In the context of stretched balance sheets, the much- needed monetary policy loosening is having limited effect.
All this is quite worrying.
Arvind Subramaniam, chief economic adviser until last year, has now thrown up an even bigger concern, by arguing that “Official estimates place annual average GDP growth between 2011-12 and 2016-17 at about 7 per cent. We estimate that actual growth may have been about 4.5 per cent”.
If this is right, past views of the performance of the Indian economy and the reliability of Indian statistics were plainly wrong.
Beyond these concerns, all significant, lies the deteriorating global environment.
There is now a real possibility of a war in the Middle East, with possibly large effects on the price of oil.
More important still, the outcome of Donald Trump’s trade wars remains highly unpredictable.
A breakdown of US trade relations with China seems unlikely to benefit India, since it has never been willing, perhaps able, to make itself a hub for globally-oriented manufacturing.
But the disintegration of the global trading system is dangerous, especially for a country that is outside all big regional trading arrangements.
It is clear that India needs reform if it is to thrive.
It must fix the financial sector, perhaps by creating a publicly managed “bad bank”, to accelerate the cleaning up of defective balance sheets.
As Mr Acharya argues, it must also proceed with the overhaul of labour laws and regulations, easier land acquisitions for non-farm uses, reform of agricultural marketing, and making the bankruptcy process work far better.
Much of the needed effort will also have to focus on institutions of government, including the tax system, competition policy, management of natural resources （especially water and air quality）, education, agriculture and relations between the centre and the states.
The statistical services are apparently in serious need of repair, too.
Mr Modi has to be an exception to the rule that second-term leaders are no better than their first-term selves.
He must use his present prestige and power to transform India.
He needs to strengthen institutions — not weaken them and promote markets — not leave them hobbled.
He must also seek to ensure basic economic security for all Indians.
If, in the absence of action, India’s economy falters further, perilous things might happen.
The big worry is that strong leaders tend to choose the politics of paranoia when the economy fails.
In India, that could be lethal.
Embrace of deep reform is now essential if Mr Modi is to bequeath a stable India.
He has the freedom to act.
Now is the time to do so.

President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Iranian targets in response to Tehran’s shooting down of a naval surveillance drone before reversing course, according to multiple US media outlets.
The New York Times said Mr Trump approved attacks on targets such as radar and missile installations and that US aircraft were en route when a decision was taken to abort the mission.
The Washington Post and ABC News also reported the developments.
President Donald Trump played down the significance of Iran shooting down a US drone over the Gulf, saying he found it “hard to believe” the move was intentional only hours after he had warned that Tehran had made a “very big mistake”.
Tensions between the US and Iran, which were already high, mounted on Thursday after Iran shot down a US Navy surveillance drone. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard said its air force fired on the drone after it “violated” Iranian airspace, but the US said the unmanned surveillance aircraft was flying in international airspace.
“I find it hard to believe it was intentional,” Mr Trump said on Thursday while receiving Justin Trudeau, Canadian prime minister, at the White House. “It could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it . . . But it was a very foolish move.”
Coming one week after Washington accused Iran of attacking two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, the shooting down of the drone raised concerns the US would respond with military action, increasing the possibility of a full-scale conflict in the Middle East.
The White House held a classified briefing for lawmakers on Thursday afternoon.
Afterwards, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, urged the administration to avoid taking a “reckless” approach to the crisis.
“It is essential that we remain fully engaged with our allies, recognise that we are not dealing with a responsible adversary and do everything in our power to de-escalate,” Ms Pelosi said. “This is a dangerous, high-tension situation that requires a strong, smart and strategic, not reckless, approach.”
Some critics are worried John Bolton, the hawkish national security adviser, will urge Mr Trump to take military action against Iran.
Asked on Thursday if some of his team were trying to push him into war, Mr Trump said that was not the case.
“No, not at all. Not at all. In fact, in many cases, it’s the opposite,” Mr Trump said. “I said I want to get out of these endless wars. I campaigned on that . . . But this is something, this is a new wrinkle. This is a new fly in the ointment, what happened shooting down the drone. And this country will not stand for it, that I can tell you.”
Earlier on Thursday, Lieutenant General Joseph Guastella, the commander of US air forces in the Middle East, said the attack occurred “in the vicinity of established air corridors” and that the drone never flew closer than 34km from the Iranian coast.
US Central Command, which overseas US military operations in the region, said its Global Hawk high-altitude surveillance drone — which can remain airborne for more than 24 hours — was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile while over the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world’s most important shipping routes for oil and gas.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard said the aircraft was shot down in the southern Iranian province of Hormuzgan, adjacent to the Strait of Hormuz.
When asked how he would respond, Mr Trump said in the Oval Office: “You’ll find out.
“This drone was in international waters, clearly,” the president said. “We have it all documented scientifically, not just words. And they made a very bad mistake.”
The Pentagon released a map that it said showed the drone’s path from launch to where it was shot down, in an effort to prove it had not entered Iranian airspace.
Iran criticised the US for what it said was a provocative action.
General Hossein Salami, commander of the Revolutionary Guard, told Iranian state television that the downing of the drone “sent a clear message” to the US.
Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, wrote on Twitter that Iran would take the case of the US encroaching on Iranian territory to the UN.
“We don’t seek war, but will zealously defend our skies, land and waters,” Mr Zarif wrote.

Tencent-backed WeDoctor is backpedalling on plans to list overseas, according to people familiar with the Chinese healthtech group’s thinking, as international disclosure requirements start to weigh on data-heavy companies.
Many Chinese start-ups have amassed huge troves of data, including in sensitive areas such as citizens’ health.
That has made companies — and regulators — wary of overseas listings, which would entail greater disclosure and scrutiny.
China’s data sovereignty rules call for all Chinese personal data to be held onshore, and industry insiders say there is increasing squeamishness about overseas listings by companies that store such data — in a mirror image of US regulators’ concerns about Chinese companies acquiring personal data in the US.
Souring sentiment in China has derailed plans for initial public offerings at facial recognition companies that also have government contracts.
Alibaba-backed Megvii put plans to raise as much as $1bn in an IPO on ice this month.
WeDoctor, which has a tie-up with insurer AIA, is the first healthtech company to wobble. The group raised $500m at a valuation of $5.5bn in May 2018, just weeks before rival Good Doctor, which is backed by insurance company Ping An, launched a $1.1bn IPO in Hong Kong. Good Doctor stock swiftly wilted: shares sold at HK$54.80 apiece are trading at HK$35.
Jieyuan Liao, WeDoctor chief executive, said the parent company intended to list overseas, but that its immediate focus was on a domestic listing.
According to one person familiar with WeDoctor’s thinking, domestic options include hiving off units, reversing them into shell companies and listing them on the soon-to-launch Shanghai Technology & Innovation Board.
“As the business and [China healthcare] policy evolved in late 2018, [management] could see a Hong Kong IPO was not that sensible” and focused more on some of the domestic Chinese A-share market activities, the person said.
“There are contracts with government and more individual health data, so the view . . . is not to be listed outside China. Instead, there will be spin-offs and listing businesses in China.”
Bankers said start-ups are increasingly having to tussle with the opposing forces of working with the Chinese government or taking international money — a choice that is becoming sharply polarised by the expanding trade and tech war between Beijing and Washington.
One banker said many companies are realising there is more long-term value in government contracts than in an international IPO.
WeDoctor is an online platform where patients can get medical advice from doctors.
It claims more than 220,000 doctors and 27m monthly active users, according to its LinkedIn profile.
In addition to Tencent, its backers include Goldman Sachs and private equity group Hillhouse Capital.
Healthtech companies have flourished in China in the past few years, raising the bulk of the $5.6bn poured into the sector in Asia-Pacific last year, according to HealthTech Alpha, an analytics group.
But would-be IPO candidates are also contending with markets that are balking at the bloated valuations minted last year.
“The reality is a lot of valuations got so high there is no way they can list at anything like close to that,” said one tech banker.

Banks in China are facing a pinch on liquidity following the government takeover of a commercial bank that is resetting the rules for trading in the country’s interbank market.
Many of China’s more than 4,000 banks face difficulty raising deposits in smaller cities and rural areas, making them more reliant on wholesale borrowing from the interbank market, where banks lend to one another.
But the government takeover of Baoshang Bank in May has disrupted the willingness of larger banks to lend to smaller ones, leaving some strained for liquidity.
The state intervention at Baoshang guaranteed the bank’s negotiable certificates of deposit up to just Rmb50m （$7.3m）, breaking with an implied government guarantee on all lending and leaving other banks with higher exposures to Baoshang to negotiate a resolution.
For interbank lenders, including some of China’s largest financial institutions, the treatment of Baoshang represents a sharp shift in the rules of the market.
“It’s not just concern on credit risk, it’s also about the resolution mechanism [for defaults on interbank borrowings],” said Katherine Lei, co-head of Asia ex-Japan banks research at JPMorgan.
“What is the mechanism and how long does it take?”
Pressure on funding for small banks comes at a difficult moment for China’s banking system.
While most analysts believe the country’s largest banks are well capitalised, some mid-tier banks and many smaller institutions face rapidly rising bad debt as China’s economy slows down.
“The large banks have been very reluctant to lend to small banks so the People’s Bank of China has had to lend directly to them,” Ms Lei said.
Incidents such as the takeover of Baoshang Bank have led to concerns that there are hidden risks that have only just started to manifest, and that those could spread to places such as the interbank market where NCDs totalled Rmb9.8tn last year.
The negotiable certificate of deposit market suffered a swift tightening in the days following the Baoshang takeover, but the central bank has moved to support lending in the market as the end of the first half of the year approaches, a period known in China for cash crunches.
Last week the central bank stepped in to give explicit backing to a negotiable certificate of deposit from Bank of Jinzhou, which has yet to issue its financial statement for 2018 and recently announced that its auditor, EY, had resigned.
“After the takeover, the demand for regional banks’ interbank NCDs declined and the pricing tightened to reflect heightened uncertainties as to whether and to what extent the government would apply similar resolution strategies to other distressed banks,” Moody’s analyst Yulia Wan wrote in a report this week.
The heightened risk around small banks will put under pressure Rmb4.8tn of the Rmb70tn that China’s city and rural banks borrow from the wholesale market, Richard Xu, financials analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a report this week.
Banks based in regions where gross domestic product growth has been hit hardest by the economic slowdown would face the biggest difficulty borrowing in the interbank market, he said.

The fight between China’s ecommerce giants has stalled.
As the market matures, there is little ammunition left to bridge the gap between leader Alibaba and runner-up JD.com.
Alibaba has triple the market share and higher margins.
Even JD.com’s record breaking $26bn in transactions during its annual 6.18 sales event （which ended on June 18） is not enough to distract from its low margins.
Tencent and Walmart, JD.com’s two largest shareholders apart from the founder, were once hopeful that it could overtake Alibaba.
This looks unlikely.
China’s second biggest ecommerce operator is still Alibaba’s only real rival （Pinduoduo is too small） but shares have fallen by a third in the past year.
Operating margins have been under pressure for years, at 1.6 per cent in the first quarter and negative on a yearly basis.
Low profits and hopes of growth explain why JD.com shares trade at 41 times forward earnings compared with Alibaba’s 25 times.
Yet JD.com’s own operating model accounts for much of its weakness.
Like Amazon, but unlike Alibaba, JD.com operates most of its supply chain.
The extra security this implies makes JD.com a popular destination for big ticket transactions, with amount spent per customer higher than peers.
But it also means costs, from logistics to warehouses, are higher.
Alibaba’s model is less capital intensive.
It provides an online marketplace for third-party sellers and buyers.
Advertising is a key revenue source.
Meanwhile, competition has forced JD.com to lower fees and invest in technology. Yet it has failed to grow overseas. Plans for Europe and the US have fizzled while Alibaba has increased international commerce revenue by a quarter in the first quarter by opening its AliExpress platform to overseas businesses. Shareholders, unlike shoppers, will not care when JD.com’s next anniversary sale is until margins improve.

Few companies can even dream of the sort of brand awareness enjoyed by Tencent.
The Chinese super app is so sewn into the lives of people in China — who use it to work, play, pay and everything in between — that it is hard to last a day without it.
Its messaging app WeChat boasts over 1bn accounts and users on average spend more than a couple of hours a day on it.
Big brands from Burberry to Gucci to Starbucks hold official accounts, where users can watch influencers flaunt products, or access flash sales.
Critics query the privacy of using WeChat: earlier this year Li Shufu, chairman of Geely Automobile,  opined that Tencent chairman Pony Ma was “definitely looking at our WeChat messages every day”.
More recently, however, Tencent found itself facing battle from a hitherto more benign quarter — Beijing.
Having largely facilitated the rise of its tech giants — initially Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent — with a light regulatory touch and effective block on foreign competitors like Facebook, Google and Twitter, Beijing changed its tone in 2017.
Gaming, the cash engine of the $400bn tech conglomerate, suddenly found itself in the line of fire.
Far from being a much-loved brand, Tencent’s games came to symbolise everything Beijing was against: addictive, spirit-sapping and even a cause of myopia.
A low point came with a warning carried by the People’s Liberation Army （PLA） Daily newspaper that Tencent’s hit mobile game King of Glory was proving popular among soldiers thereby jeopardising their ability to fight.
“There is certainly a security risk that can’t be overlooked. The game requires constant attention but a soldier’s job is full of uncertainty. Once a soldier is cut-off from the game for an urgent mission, he could be absent-minded during the operation if his mind remains in the game,” the PLA Daily warned.
Worse was to come.
Regulators stopped approving commercial licences for online games in late March after media regulation was put under direct Communist party control.
That left Tencent and its peers in the unenviable position of being able to publish games, but unable to make money from them.
Since the resumption of approvals at the end of last year, only a few have gone to Tencent — mostly dull, educational games that are not its flag bearers.
Tencent called time on the popular PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds mobile game in China after it failed to get approval, instead launching a reworked version named Elite Force for Peace.
PUBG has enjoyed plenty of success, raking in $146m last month to become the world’s top grossing mobile title.
$76m came from global app stores, while its Chinese version generated $70m, according to US analytics firm Sensor Tower.
The Peace version — which places the player in training missions for the Chinese military — may have burnished its brand in Beijing’s eyes and brought in plenty of revenue to date, but player numbers are cooling.
Daily average users have recently dropped to 56m versus 75m for PUBG, according to HSBC.
More to the point: the fact that regulators so readily intervene presents a persistent risk to the company’s plans.
In addition to gaming Tencent, like its peers, wages constant battle over censorship of untoward content, which consists of a broad and constantly changing body of text and images in President Xi Jinping’s China.
For Liz Flora, researcher at Gartner, the strict regulation is a double-edged sword for Tencent and its tech peers. “They must incur large costs to hire moderators and face the prospect of arbitrary, immediate regulations disruptive to their business, including freezes on operations, account purges, takedowns of popular content, or even permanent app shutdowns. The prospect of this is always looming for them.” But she notes that Tencent is well aware of the pitfalls.
Dolce & Gabbana for example sparked  controversy and accusations of racism last November when it ran a video on WeChat featuring a Chinese model struggling to eat Italian food using chopsticks, topped with sexual innuendos — the narrators asks, “Is it still too big for you?” — around an oversized cannolo.
The social media uproar caused a 2,512 per cent spike in universally negative Weibo conversations about the brand, the cancellation of a multimillion dollar China fashion show, removal from e-commerce platforms, and the loss of all of its Chinese brand ambassadors.
But when it comes to brand recognition, Tencent is taking lessons from its more brand-aware peers overseas.
It is ramping up tie-ups with museums and other cultural spots and seeking to take its brands global in a very China-meets-Hollywood way.
Hence alongside the savvy brands like Nike and Coca-Cola appearing in the recent blockbuster animation Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse so did QQ, Tencent’s original chat app, one now usurped by younger users — and apparently also the main character Miles Morales, who uses QQ to text his friends.

At first glance, global brands are in robust health, with the top 100 rising in combined value to $4.7tn and US technology companies led by Amazon, Apple and Google spanning the globe.
But there has rarely been more to worry those who own and invest in consumer brands.
The most unsettling event this year for branded goods companies and marketers was the $15.4bn impairment of Kraft Heinz assets in February.
Reliable US Kraft food and drink brands such as Velveeta and Kool-Aid turned out to have little appeal to those who are not American baby boomers.
This is not to say that US consumer brands are fading; quite the opposite to judge by the 2019 list.
Generation Z brands such as Netflix and Instagram, founded in 1997 and 2010 respectively, leapt up the ranking, while Google and Facebook continue to occupy the top 10.
But a large part of the value of a brand is endurance.
The value of the name spans generations and can be relied upon to pull consumers.
“If you think about it, people do not change their habits that much,” Warren Buffett said earlier this year, and he carefully built Berkshire Hathaway’s investments around long-lasting brands such as Coca-Cola and Geico.
Judged by that measure, old brands are under stress.
The best are rising in value but their ranks turn over faster than before, with new entrants in technology and luxury pushing out stalwarts.
“A diamond is forever” was the inimitable 1948 De Beers advertising slogan — but a brand is not.
Globalisation is one reason for brand volatility.
All except three of the top 20 in the BrandZ ranking are from the US, and the continent’s brand hegemony over Europe is not threatened.
But China’s transition into the world’s biggest market for online retailing and service is shaking it.
Alibaba and Tencent are top 10 brands, and others such as Xiaomi and Meituan have entered the top 100. Chinese companies have shown they can create new services, rather than just adapting US innovation, and they are starting to become global brands, with 15 Chinese brands in the top 100.
A second, connected, factor is technology.
Rapid innovation in consumer technology and the internet has shaken up the brand rankings over the past two decades and created such powerful entities in Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook that there are calls for an antitrust response.
But technology does not stand still — fresh developments from artificial intelligence to electric engines are combining with global internet infrastructure to open new possibilities in many fields.
Uber is advancing from ride-hailing to working on providing vertical take-off flying taxis in cities.
A third reason is generational change.
Both the millennial generation and younger consumers seek different qualities in consumer goods and services than the baby boom generation, leading to rapid brand upheaval in sectors from food and drink to travel and beauty.
That is obvious both from the troubles of Kraft Heinz, in which Berkshire has a stake, and the ascendancy of Gen Z brands such as Instagram.
A mobile photo sharing site would not have been possible until recently.
Instagram was bought by Facebook for $1bn in 2012, but its brand value alone is now estimated at $28.2bn.

Government officials in the Chinese tourist hotspot of Hainan have told popular hotel chain Vienna International to change the name of its branches because their reference to the European city reflects a “worship of foreign things”, sparking a stand-off with China’s largest hotel group.
The civil affairs bureau in the island province — sometimes referred to as China’s Hawaii because of its beaches — has issued a list of dozens of businesses with names that should be “rectified” because they suggested “worship of foreign things”.
Among them were establishments named Victoria Hotel, Heidelberg Hotel and 15 branches of the mid-range chain Vienna International Hotels.
The Vienna brand’s hundreds of outlets in China are majority owned by Jinjiang Group, China’s largest hotel operator, which operates more than 10,000 hotels worldwide and owns a majority stake in US group Radisson Hospitality.
“The country is now culturally confident. China has thousands of years of culture. Is it appropriate to use these foreign names on Chinese territory? Isn’t this hurting the feelings of the nation?” a civil affairs official told a state-run Hainan newspaper.
State-owned Jinjiang responded in a social media post this week saying that it had lodged a formal objection with Hainan’s civil affairs bureau.
The company said it had registered Vienna Hotels as a trademark until 2022 and had a right to use the name.
It declined to comment further.
The Hainan government also ordered changes to business with “feudal” names such as “Coral Palace” and “Imperial Garden District”, ostensibly because they refer to China’s imperial past, as well as names they judged to be “incomprehensible” or “strange”.
The Hainan government official, who the state-run newspaper quoted but did not name, said the province’s effort were part of a national campaign.
The dispute comes as companies from the US and Canada have complained of punitive measures in China due to the trade war and diplomatic dispute over Chinese company Huawei, which have soured Beijing’s relations between the two countries.
In most cases the measures taken, such as extra customs checks, slower approvals and audits, reflect the efforts of zealous local officials rather than any formal orders from Beijing, according to businesspeople.
Chinese property and hotel projects are often named after foreign cities or regions.
A 2017 survey of projects in 137 Chinese cities found that Paris, Venice, Versailles, California, Rome, Champs-Elysées and Victoria were among the most common names used.
Local governments have periodically clamped down on the practice over the years.
In 2017 officials in a district of the city of Xi’an in central China criticised the names of several buildings for being too foreign.
They included a residential complex named after France’s Seine river and California City Plaza, a shopping mall.
It was not clear if their names were later changed.

Before “Swinegate”, UBS was riding high in China.
The Swiss bank had recently gained approval to take majority control over its onshore securities joint venture UBS Securities, the most comprehensive of all the foreign-backed securities houses in the country.
Sporting a full suite of investment banking licences, the Chinese operation put UBS in pole position to cash in on an expected acceleration of financial sector reforms in China.
“The government has said [it] clear and loud,” one UBS executive said. “The Chinese market needs to institutionalise very fast and position itself as one of the leading capital markets for medium and long-term capital, and by that they mean foreign investors.”
As a non-US group, UBS felt particularly well placed at a time of escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing. “It is convenient if you are not from the US, you are seen as less risky and entrusted with a bigger load of responsibility,” the executive said. “In China, we always deliver.”
But then last Wednesday an apparently innocuous UBS economics research note that referenced the swine flu epidemic was denounced as “racist” and “distasteful” on social media — prompting some large Chinese clients to drop the Swiss bank.
In the note on consumer price inflation, economist Paul Donovan employed the phrase “Chinese pigs” when discussing the impact of swine flu on China’s consumer prices. “Does this matter?” he asked in reference to the outbreak. “It matters if you are a Chinese pig. It matters if you like eating pork in China.”
The wording was quickly seized upon by Chinese speakers on social media.
UBS, which has one of the largest private banking franchises in Asia, was accused of calling Chinese people pigs.
Although in context the phrase seemed inoffensive to native English speakers, Mr Donovan quickly apologised.
It was not enough.
Within two days of publishing the report Haitong Securities, one of China’s largest securities houses, had severed ties with the bank.
By Monday it had been removed as an underwriter from a bond transaction of up to $1bn by state-owned China Railway Construction Corporation.
On Tuesday, one executive at a foreign rival said UBS was fighting to retain mandates on an acquisition deal and an equities raising.
The incident, known internally at UBS as Swinegate, demonstrates the growing tension between foreign companies and a Chinese nation beset by a slowing economy and an intensifying trade war with the US.
Last Friday the bank placed Mr Donovan on indefinite leave of absence.
The move was designed to take the sting out of calls for him to be sacked.
Assuming the furore dies down, managers say they expect him to return to work in a matter of days.
UBS has put in place a new layer of controls on all its research, though it said no publications had been halted or delayed by the checks.
The debacle has put UBS in a delicate situation in which it must protect its growing business in China and Hong Kong and show it is mindful of cultural sensitivities, while also being seen to treat staff fairly.
“We have to be very careful,” said one executive. “If we did fire him, we’d have a massive backlash from staff.”
Beyond UBS, experts fear the harsh response from some of China’s largest companies could be a taste of things to come for multinational corporations as the trade war pulls China and the US — and by extension other western nations — further apart.
“This may well happen more often as the process of decoupling progresses,” said Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. “The ‘Chinese pigs’ saga is ridiculous as there is no reason to see that as racist on the part of the UBS analyst. But there we are.”
Foreign companies in China have for years been subject to the vehement reactions of Chinese consumers and the government, which often publishes state media editorials claiming that western groups have hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.
The UBS furore is different, according to China media specialist David Bandurski, as the reaction has largely been left to Chinese netizens.
“The Paul Donovan case, I think, is really arising more out of a backlash online and from the financial industry in China, and so far the leadership and its media outlets have taken a back seat,” said Mr Bandurski, who runs the China Media Project in Hong Kong.
The nuances of the language in the UBS report have been fiercely debated online.
On China’s heavily censored version of Twitter, called Weibo, many Chinese speakers have argued that the use of the phrase “Chinese pig” was at best insensitive, at worst a racial slur hearkening back to the days when imperialist powers divided up the country.
“In finance, defending analysts isn’t good biz any more,” said Andy Xie, an independent economist, who was fired from his job as chief Asia-Pacific economist at Morgan Stanley in 2006 after an internal email containing criticisms about Singapore was leaked. “Two decades ago, institutional investors paid 25 [basis points] to brokers for good research and integrity. That biz has come down to 6bp: not profitable any more.”

Former president of Interpol Meng Hongwei has confessed in a Chinese court to taking millions of yuan in bribes and other kickbacks, after China's anti-graft body accused him of using state funds to support a "lavish" lifestyle.
Meng went missing while in October last year on a trip to China while still head of Interpol, the organisation that facilitates international police force coordination and arrest requests.
Chinese authorities later confirmed that he had been targeted in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s sweeping corruption campaign and was suspected of “severe disciplinary violations”, a euphemism for corruption.
Meng, who became the first Chinese national to head Interpol in 2016, had previously been living in Lyon, France, with his wife. China did not inform the organisation or the French government of the corruption investigation prior to Meng's disappearance.
The case has raised questions about Interpol’s vulnerability to autocratic states that might wish to use the organisation to target political rivals.
The former Chinese policeman from 2005 to 2017 had used his positions as a vice minister of public security and head of China’s coast guard to rack up Rmb14.46 million （$2.11m） in cash and other bribes given to secure his help with promotions and business ventures, prosecutors said, according to a statement released by the Tianjin courthouse.
Meng, whose hair appeared to have grown visibly greyer during his detention, accepted the charges and expressed regret over his actions.
A verdict will be released at a later date.
The trial comes after a probe into Meng’s conduct by China’s powerful anti-graft body, the National Supervisory Commission, which found that he had “resisted implementing central party decisions” and had “wantonly squandered state funds to satisfy his family’s lavish lifestyle”.
Mr Xi has pledged an unceasing war on graft within the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party.
Since he took office, hundreds of thousands of officials have been investigated, from top party leaders to lowly civil servants.
The campaign, in part an effort to raise public trust in cadres, has targeted officials across various factions within the leadership, but has stopped short of probing leaders close to Mr Xi.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guard claims it has shot down a US drone in the country’s airspace – but a US official said the drone was downed in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz.
As Washington ordered more US troops to the region this week, the incident threatens to exacerbate already heightened tensions given US warnings of a strong response to any Iranian attacks on its interests.
The guard announced that its air force “targeted and shot down a Global Hawk, a US spy aircraft, when it violated the airspace of the Islamic Republic of Iran” early on Thursday, according to the official IRNA news agency.
It said the US unmanned surveillance aircraft was shot down in the southern Iranian province of Hormuzgan, which sits along the Gulf and is located near the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world’s most important shipping routes for oil and gas.
General Hossein Salami, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards, speaking on Iranian state television after the incident said the shooting down of the drone “sent a clear message” to America.
Brent crude oil hit its highest level of the month after the incident.
The international oil marker was up 2.7 per cent at $63.53 per barrel, setting it on course for its biggest single-session rise since April.
The incident comes after two oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman last week, with the US and Saudi Arabia blaming Iran for the incidents. Iran has denied any involvement.
President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday said that the US apportioning of blame, which was supported by “the UK and one or two small countries in the region”, was “a political game and propaganda” against a country that “has been protecting and safeguarding the waterway throughout history for thousands of years”.
Iran announced on Monday that it would soon exceed limits on its enriched uranium stockpile agreed in the 2015 agreement.

A senior US cyber security official has called on the UK to “push back” against authoritarian regimes like China that use technology to conduct damaging online attacks and economic espionage.
The comments from Robert Strayer, a deputy assistant secretary of state, mark a further ratcheting up of the pressure by Washington over the UK’s view that it can mitigate the risks of involving the controversial Chinese telecoms group Huawei in future fifth-generation mobile networks.
“Given what is at stake and the uncertainty surrounding a rapidly evolving technology, we believe that using untrusted vendors anywhere in a 5G network introduces an unacceptable level of risk that cannot be mitigated,” Mr Strayer said in a speech at parliament on Wednesday.
He added that the US would not allow countries like China to “unfairly support their digital companies at the expense of foreign competitors, or to conduct damaging cyber attacks and economic espionage on their rivals for commercial gain”.
Although a final decision on Huawei’s future participation in the UK’s 5G networks is now likely to be taken by Theresa May’s successor as prime minister, a leak in April from the government’s National Security Council, a body made up of senior ministers, officials and intelligence chiefs, revealed Britain was ready to give Huawei restricted access to future telecoms infrastructure.
The in-principle decision rested on the UK view that its new telecoms infrastructure could be kept safe from destructive cyber attacks and espionage by banning Huawei from the core of the networks — a view US officials has repeatedly rejected.
Mr Strayer has been one of the most critical American voices on the issue, threatening earlier this year that intelligence sharing between the UK and US could be threatened by the British decision — something President Donald Trump played down on his state visit to the UK this month.
The timing of Mr Strayer’s visit to the UK, alongside the assistant attorney-general for national security John Demers, comes as the race to lead the Conservative party and become the UK’s next prime minister is reaching a crucial stage.
US government and UK security officials however played down any suggestion that the trip, which includes two more public appearances and a meeting with Ciaran Martin, the chief executive of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, was an attempt to influence the next Tory leader over Huawei.
Conservative MP Bob Seely nevertheless said he was looking to raise Huawei and the threat to technology posed by authoritarian states with each of the remaining Tory leadership candidates in the coming days.
“I want to see our candidates come out with strong positions on how we deal with authoritarian states,” Mr Seely said.
So far Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt are the only Tory leadership contenders to express a view on Huawei, with both raising concerns about the move to include the company in future 5G networks.
Frontrunner Boris Johnson has not yet commented on the matter.
A government spokesperson said a final decision would be announced to parliament in due course.
“The UK is not considering any options that would put at risk our national security communications, within the UK and with our closest allies,” the spokesperson added.

Nuclear power is in danger of fading away as a significant source of electricity supply.
The fade will be gradual but is already evident in Germany and the US and the trend is likely to be followed in France, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and Belgium.
In many other areas, existing plants are ageing and while the working lives of some stations will be extended many may not be replaced.
In some cases the process will take decades — in France it will start in the 2030s and South Korean plans stretch to 2060.
The rate of decline in the US will be determined by court action against subsidies to the nuclear sector and by attempts to change existing legislation to  limit support for renewables.
These shifts will be balanced in part by growth in China and India and perhaps in the Middle East.
In Japan, the industry will recover some market share as plants closed after the Fukushima disaster reopen.
However, the trend is clear: nuclear will provide a gradually reducing share of total global energy demand.
The authors of a new report from the International Energy Agency spell out what is happening in detail and regard the fade （their phrase） as deeply regrettable — a surprising conclusion from an organisation that is usually impeccably neutral between different technologies.
Their view is driven by the assumption that nuclear power is essential to the energy transition and the move to a lower carbon economy.
Nuclear could certainly be part of that process but, as the report makes clear, there are several good reasons why neither consumers nor investors are rushing to take the nuclear option.
Serious accidents from Three Mile Island in the US in 1979 to Fukushima in 2011 raise the perception of risk.
In normal operations nuclear is a safe source of power.
But the record of accidents, each accompanied by confusion and poor communication by industry and governments, has undermined public confidence.
The new drama documentary on Chernobyl being screened by Sky Atlantic will only reinforce the concerns.
The sector’s problems are not limited to fear — rational or irrational.
Economics are equally important.
The imposition of gold-plated regulations that fail to recognise different levels of risk is one barrier.
But the real issue lies with the industry.
Standardised programmes of nuclear development using relatively simple reactors can be very cost effective and have provided the basis for the success of the industry in France in the past and now in China.
Those in the business have, however, been tempted into developing large-scale reactors such as the European Pressurized Reactor whose construction is complex.
Flamanville, the new nuclear plant under construction in northern France, was intended as the showcase for the EPR but it is now more than eight years late and more than €7bn over budget.
The EPR at Hinkley Point in Somerset is also years behind schedule and even more expensive.
If and when Hinkley finally comes on-stream, British consumers will be burdened for decades with the price of the electricity produced there index-linked for 35 years from the exorbitant level of £92.50 per megawatt hour originally set in 2013.
The crucial economic problem for the industry is that the high cost of new nuclear has become more visible because of the sharp fall in the costs of wind and solar power over the past decade.
With storage technology also advancing, large-scale alternative supplies of low-carbon energy are becoming available which carry none of the construction risks associated with nuclear plants.
Consumers and politicians may not understand all the complexities of the energy business but they do understand prices, just as investors know that construction delays and cost overruns mean lower returns.
The financial problems associated with Flamanville and Hinkley Point have probably done more damage to the prospects of nuclear power than Fukushima.
The authors of the IEA report take no account of the potential for either wind or solar to continue to fall in cost and, with storage, to be able to provide large volumes of low-cost low-carbon energy in the future.
The report does not mention the trend towards distributed supplies of electric power which is reducing the need for large-scale centralised production.
Clearly, if nuclear does fade major investment in other sources of supply and in the transmission system will be needed but the IEA’s conclusion relies on a series of negative assumptions about the development of renewables.
A nuclear fade is perfectly possible and could come more rapidly than predicted by the IEA.
But it is also perfectly manageable.
The shift to a low-carbon economy will come when technology produces low-cost power that is competitive against all other potential sources.
If nuclear can do that it will win.
But if it remains uncompetitive, a fade is inevitable.

“Those who fall in love with the Medusa have no way back,” cautioned Gianni Versace, the late designer who made the snake-haired temptress the emblem of his Italian fashion empire. His words rang true in Milan this month; the house opened its opulent palazzo headquarters to showcase its latest furniture collection during the design fair Salone del Mobile.
Here was Medusa reimagined through a pop prism.
Her unmistakable visage featured on Neapolitan-hued thrones （cast in polyurethane and dotted outside on the vast terrace）, ceramic vases, surfboards and hanging lights filled with coloured sand.
Her face was even inscribed into the weft of the kaleidoscopic carpets, commissioned from the Radici carpet maker.
Versace’s fascination with the Medusa myth is said to have sprung from the historic mosaic floors that he played on with his sister Donatella as a child — and the heavy door-knocker of the Via Gesu headquarters he bought in 1982.
The designer frequently compared the gorgon to his sister, even commissioning the artist Julian Schnabel to paint her as a modern-day Medusa.
His was the Medusa of Ovid — she of “shining hair” and “charms” — and her persona represents a dynamic and adventurous beauty, an attitude that has been expressed throughout every aspect of the brand.
Other designers were also gripped by the Greek legends at Salone.
At Richard Ginori, the Kering-owned ceramics brand that has been furnishing Italian tables since 1735, the British designer and Financial Times columnist Luke Edward Hall collaborated on a collection, “Il Viaggio di Nettuno”, that borrowed from the worlds of goddess and myth.
“There’s something wild about the Greeks,” says Hall of the pretty line-up of vases, plates, cups and candleholders decorated with naive illustrations portraying, among others, Salacia, the goddess of salt water. “She presided over the depths of the ocean. I often look to myths, legends and folklore for inspiration — they’re so full of drama, magic and mad creatures,” he says. “I love that they’re powerful and mighty, but it’s also interesting how complicated the gods and goddesses are — not perfect, just like humans.”
For JJ Martin, the American creative director behind the clothing and tableware label La Double J, there is much fun to be had with female gods.
During the furniture fair Martin transformed her Milan studio into a mythic haven, even creating a fairytale “Princess and the Pea” mattress mountain to show off her new line of patterned bedding.
She also showcased cushions etched with Greek goddesses, a precursor to a complete collection of clothing and decorative objects coming out in July, which posed the question: which goddess are you?
“Each goddess represents an archetype in female psychology,” explains Martin, who has lately been immersed in Goddesses In Everywoman, by the Jungian psychiatrist Jean Shinoda Bolen. “It’s a great way for women to understand their strengths and weaknesses.” Martin, for instance, is a self-described Artemis, the independent spirit who is goddess of the hunt and the moon. Women with a dominant sense of equality, such as Gertrude Stein, are also associated with this goddess. On the other hand, an Athena, goddess of wisdom and craft, is most likely to be found among men in the world of investment banking or law, while a Hera, goddess of marriage, is the woman whose sole commitment is finding her man.
Hillary Clinton, says Martin, is an Athena and a Hera: “Put it this way, she would never leave that husband.”
It’s the first time the designer has created a print in-house （previous collections have featured Italian heritage designs）. “There needs to be a new iconography for these powerful female figures,” says Martin. “Currently if you go online all the images that come up are really cheesy airbrushed 1970s pictures. I wanted to create a fresh aesthetic around positive female energy.”
She’s not alone. Elsewhere at Salone, the British designer Faye Toogood collaborated with the Brooklyn-based Calico Wallpaper to create “Muse”, a series of painterly wallcoverings that evoke the nine daughters of Zeus. The paper began life last year when Toogood was invited to temporarily decorate the office of the Italian Vogue editor, Emanuele Farneti. But rather than imagining a clean-edged, intimidating “male” office, Toogood filled the space with her curvy, chubby chairs and clad the wall in a hanging canvas of muses from the magazine’s half century of cover stars.
So successful were these figurative renderings that she revisited them this year, casting everyone from Coco Chanel to Marie Curie as her muse. Not that you could identify them. There’s a deliberate anonymity to her design. “It doesn’t matter who they are,” says Toogood, “it’s about the symbolism behind them. Muse implies that they’re important. It’s about their strength.”
Such a focus on womanly creativity is not typical of Toogood, who unsurprisingly bristles at being wheeled out as a “female” furniture maker and designer.
Her work typically plays with gender, blurring the lines between the sexes.
“We don’t have any male muses though,” she observes, “only female.”
It’s worth noting that Toogood gave birth to twin girls in 2017.
“I’ve spent the last year and a half being the ultimate mother — it’s been a moment of domestic heaviness,” she continues.
“It amazes me what women can do. Becoming a mother has enabled me to embrace that feminine power, rather than deny it.”

Amazon has been crowned the world’s most valuable brand, as the ‘Everything Store’ expands in cloud computing, consumer tech and movie production.
Founded by the world’s richest man Jeff Bezos, the Seattle-based online retailer has seen its brand value quintuple in the past five years to reach $315.5bn, according to the 2019 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands rankings.
Undertaken annually by advertising holding company WPP and its market research firm Kantar, the BrandZ study analyses firms’ financial data and draws on an extensive consumer survey to reach its conclusions.
Amazon has expanded into grocery, healthcare, food delivery and, with its Alexa devices, even voice recognition.
This proves that its name has great “brand stretch” across many different categories, said David Roth, the chairman of BrandZ.
“Amazon has played the game very well: the central proposition of its brand is that it removes friction from everything you do, making it easier, cheaper and faster to buy a product or use the cloud,” said Mr Roth.
Its rise to the top of the rankings has been steady in the past few years, and it could prove difficult to dethrone.
Chinese brands proliferate
There are 15 Chinese names in the top 100 this year, up from only one （China Mobile） when the rankings first began in 2005.
This reflects not only the immense size of their domestic market of 1.4bn people and the growing middle class, but also how successfully local players have competed against corporations from outside China.
The example of two online shopping giants Alibaba and JD.com is telling: they have seen off none other than Amazon, which announced in April that it was shutting down its Chinese ecommerce operation.
Huawei has had a tougher time of it since the US embarked on a campaign to convince its allies that the telecom network equipment and smartphone maker poses security and spying risks.
Nevertheless, Huawei actually added 8 per cent to its brand value in the past year to reach $26.9bn.
Meanwhile, domestic regulation appears to have weighed on Tencent’s brand value, declining by 27 per cent to $130.9bn year-on-year, according to the ranking.
Ecosystem brand building
There is a change afoot from individual product and service brands to a new era of highly disruptive ecosystem — a shift pioneered by several top-ranked brands, including Amazon and Apple.
Home appliance manufacturer Haier is an example: as it seeks to enable internet connectivity for its machines, it has forged partnerships with various tech companies, cloud services, and device makers.
“Haier thinks the future is all about the internet of things, so they’re trying to create an ecosystem with itself at the centre,” said Mr Roth.
The ecosystem approach can also be seen at Meituan, which started out as a food delivery app in China and morphed into a platform for local businesses to connect with consumers.
It can be used for everything from booking a haircut or arranging a delivery.
There are risks to the ecosystem approach however: it remains to be seen if brands can ensure quality control and keep their identities in such a system.
Consumers shift to experiences
Streaming video provider Netflix was the third-biggest riser among the top 100 brands, adding 65 per cent to its brand value of $34.3bn.
It typifies another trend from this year’s ranking: how brands that offer experiences to people as opposed to simply selling them products are finding favour.
In conclusion, one thing has become clear in BrandZ’s annual studies: the fear that the internet would kill brands by making comparison shopping easier and price paramount simply has not panned out.
“In an age of information overload, brands are more important than ever because they are shortcuts to help consumers make decisions,” says Mr Roth.

For years bureaucratic forms of leadership that relied on certainty, decisiveness and the power of position have prevailed.
Many MBA programmes of the 1970s and 1980s even perpetuated this approach.
But tomorrow’s leaders — and today’s MBA students — must learn something new: how leaders use their positions to orchestrate and facilitate the flow of ideas and boost employee curiosity.
This, not authority or hierarchy, will help create an appetite for experimentation and a workforce ready to try new things.
This is a departure.
As I explain in my book Alive at Work, today’s leaders are no longer in the best position to tell others what to do.
Instead, they need help from those working on the ground to provide insight about day-to-day activities.
Leaders help set the vision and the direction, while employees experiment with and develop practical new approaches to make the organisation work better.
So for true power, leaders need to listen and give others a chance to explore, experiment and improve things without fear of reprisal.
This works within small teams, larger departments and at the organisational level, so MBAs can start small, develop their style of serving the employees who do the work and hone their skills as they progress.
Relying on a position of power and hierarchy to get work done results in anxiety and low psychological safety — the degree to which people feel they can take risks without fear of recrimination — which quickly stifles employees’ natural drive to experiment and learn. Top-down orders from arrogant MBAs kill curiosity.
Instead, leaders should engender employee enthusiasm about experimenting and learning.
Ironically, humble leadership works not by demanding perfection, but its opposite — by showing that humans are never perfect and must explore, fail and practice in order to learn and improve.
Get this right, and you will have a workforce where people think like owners, and are willing to work hard and work smart to make the organisation’s vision become reality.
In a fast-changing world, agility is critical for long-lasting organisational success.
If MBAs can learn the route to humble leadership, this will be a huge advantage in their careers and will actively help them to achieve corporate success.
The business schools that ultimately produce these graduates must act as guides on this journey.
This responsibility is a real one, but so too is the opportunity that accompanies it.
Many MBA students will go on to hold leadership positions.
They will take with them the lessons learnt during their time at business school.
I will be teaching MBA students at London Business School about the power of humble leadership as part of a new elective, on employee engagement and positive psychology.
A fully-rounded business education must encompass different approaches and understandings of leadership.
Teaching MBAs how to gain and retain power is not enough to get the best ideas and motivation of teams; neither is defining effective business practice as a top-down, one-way transaction.
Instead, business schools should arm their graduates with the confidence to fail and the self-assuredness to encourage those they lead to do so too.
Either learn how to fail, or fail to learn.
Only then can employee creativity, experimentation and innovation be fully unleashed.

Brands are intangible assets but that does not make them immune from trade conflicts involving physical goods.
To thrive, brands need to make themselves indispensable, suggests Elspeth Chueng, global director of the brand equity database BrandZ: “It’s not just about the product, but what consumers need in their daily lives.” As prices rise to compensate for higher tariffs — $200bn imposed by the US and $60bn by China in May — brands will need to justify that extra money.
Just take US car companies in China, which are feeling the strain already.
Sales in China have dropped for the first time since 1990, partly as a result of trade war uncertainty prompting consumers to hold back on purchases.
Cars dropped from being the third most valuable exported good to China from the US at over $10bn in 2017, to fourth at $6.65bn in 2018, according to US Census trade data.
Ford has seen a decline in sales in China and has since dropped off the list of top 100 most valuable global brands. Luxury car brands, such as Mercedes-Benz, which has its biggest market in China at 28 per cent of its total unit sales, are seeing a slowdown in growth.
It is premature to forecast the demise of these companies on the basis of higher tariffs alone, however. “There have been a lot of tariffs on auto parts and components but nobody can find it in pricing anywhere,” says Scott Miller, senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic International Studies in Washington. Instead, Miller identifies economic nationalism as a more impactful risk: “I would never underestimate the power of nationalism in China”.
The carmakers are not alone in their struggle over China.
US companies including Uber and Amazon have previously tried and failed to enter the market, unable to compete with their Chinese counterparts.
Amazon’s market share fell to one per cent this year and they have since withdrawn from the country.
If the Chinese government encourages consumers there to boycott US companies, on top of competing with better-known Chinese rivals, this could make it considerably harder for American brands to establish themselves.
The Chinese government at both national and local levels could increase inspections and delay processing applications, alongside other petty enforcement measures, according to Miller.
On June 6, after the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei, citing it as a ‘national security threat’, China fined the Changan Ford car company over antitrust violations — a possible retaliation.
“It is the most worrying possibility. Chinese consumers tend to be quite patriotic,” says Cheung. While short-term harm to American brand value in China as a result of the trade war is difficult to gauge, it is certain that economic nationalism would make a big dent in both sales and reputation of brands in the long-term. In 2016 and 2017, China effectively boycotted South Korean goods as a result of the nation agreeing to deploy a US missile shield. The precedent is there, as is the potential risk.
As of yet full-on retaliation from China is only a possibility.
Craig Allen, president of the US China Business Council, is unperturbed: “If anything, the Chinese government seems to be trying to tamp down on nationalism rather than exacerbate the nascent anti-Americanism,” he says.
Brands are expressing their concern on the other side of the fence: it will not take long for higher tariffs to cost companies, and consequently consumers, in the US as well.
Since the Trump administration has increased tariffs on more than $200bn of goods on May 10, more companies have warned that higher prices adjusted to higher cost will deter consumers.
Shortly thereafter, major US footwear companies wrote an open letter to Mr Trump requesting that footwear be removed from the Section 301 list published by the United States Trade Representative.
According to the letter, adding the proposed 25 per cent tariff could burden some US families with a 100 per cent duty on shoes.
The New York Federal Reserve found that the tariff increases could cost the average US household over $800 a year.
“In the US, it will be more visible with consumer-facing goods such as apparel, footwear, luggage and consumer electrics,” says Miller.
So far, the general consensus seems to be that the impact has been contained.
But if events continue along the same trajectory, companies will have to adapt to rising costs, prices and increasingly hostile attitudes internationally.
The question that Chueng poses for brands under pressure from higher tariffs: “How are you going to offer more to the consumers so the price increase is justified?”

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady but shifted towards a more dovish stance and pointed to possible interest rate cuts in the future, citing rising “uncertainties” about the economic outlook.
At the end of a two-day meeting marked by concerns about slowing growth and rising trade tensions, the Fed said it would “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion” and would “closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook”.
This marked a change compared with previous language in which the Fed said it would simply be “patient” in determining changes to interest rate policy.
The Fed also downgraded its description of the health of the US economy, saying activity was rising at a “moderate rate” — a less rosy picture than the “solid rate” of expansion it saw in May — and noted that inflation continued to run below its 2 per cent target.
But even as the Fed set the stage for possible monetary stimulus, economic projections released by the US central bank along with its statement suggested that interest rate cuts could take time to happen — and may not occur before next year.
The median interest rate forecast of Fed officials showed no change for the rest of 2019, but a 25 basis point reduction next year, compared with their previous projection of a 25 basis point increase in 2020.
Fed chair Jay Powell faced one dissent in the decision to keep rates on hold, with James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, saying he would have preferred to cut rates on Wednesday by 25 basis points.
US government bond prices rallied on the expectation that the Fed will ease monetary policy later this year, sending the 10-year US Treasury yield dipping back to near the 2 per cent mark — a level it has not gone under in two years.
The dollar was also lower against every other major currency.
The US stock market, which came under pressure last month when resurgent trade tensions sparked concerns over economic growth, also cheered the more dovish signals. The S&P 500 added about 0.2 per cent in the wake of the Fed decision.
Despite the gathering clouds around the US outlook, economic data was still mixed and not uniformly deteriorating, according to the Fed.

New trade barriers imposed by G20 economies threaten to crimp the global economy, the World Trade Organization said in a report published on Monday.
G20 nations implemented 20 new trade-restrictive measures between mid-October and mid-May, including higher tariffs, import bans and new customs procedures for exports.
Those measures affect goods worth $335.9bn, the second-highest figure recorded since the WTO began tracking it in May 2012.
The WTO noted that the size of restrictive trade policies has spiked in the last two reporting periods, with the prior period representing the highest on record at $480.9bn.
The same economies also introduced 29 measures aimed at facilitating trade, such as eliminating or reducing tariffs and adding export duties, covering an estimated $397.2bn.
Roberto Azevêdo, director-general of the WTO, called on G20 nations to ease trade tensions, saying the report’s findings “should be of serious concern for the whole international community”.
“The stable trend that we saw for almost a decade since the financial crisis has been replaced with a steep increase in the size and scale of trade-restrictive measures over the last year. This will have consequences in increased uncertainty, lower investment and weaker trade growth,” Mr Azevêdo added.
The report arrived days before the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, where President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are scheduled to meet amid a long-running trade dispute.
Mr Trump said he will have an “extended meeting” with Mr Xi during the gathering of G20 leaders, which is set to begin on Friday.
Failure to reach a trade truce could result in additional tariffs.
The US president had threatened to impose levies on about $300bn of Chinese goods that have so far been spared from the trade war if Mr Xi skipped the G20 meeting.
The WTO report said trade-restrictive measures currently under consideration add to “the challenges faced by governments, businesses and consumers in the current global economic environment”.
Last month, the US raised existing tariffs on $200bn of imports from China, with officials accusing Beijing of “reneging” on promises made during the talks.
China retaliated by increasing tariffs on about $60bn in American goods.

In its 19th century heyday, the city of Springfield in Massachusetts produced the first industrial assembly line, the first gasoline-powered automobile and the first sleeping rail car.
Wason, one of its leading companies, made passenger coaches and streetcars for clients across the US and countries as far afield as Egypt.
While Wason went out of business in the 1930s, Springfield prospered well into the 20th century before deindustrialisation forced many of its factories to close.
So when a Chinese company announced in 2014 that it was investing $95m in a new plant to build rail cars — on a site that once housed a vast Westinghouse factory that closed in the 1970s — many in the region were excited about the prospects.
For the past four years, around 200 workers have been employed in a gleaming new factory producing cars for the Boston subway system, with work on similar contracts for Philadelphia and Los Angeles to follow.
Yet rather than being celebrated as a symbol of potential regeneration, the plant has found itself sucked into the escalating  trade conflict  between the US and China.
For its critics, the issue is symbolised by the giant Chinese flag flying alongside the stars and stripes at the main gates — a nod to its ownership by CRRC, a Chinese state-owned enterprise that is the  biggest manufacturer of rolling stock in the world.
Leading US politicians from both parties have accused the company of using its links with the Chinese state to compete unfairly for contracts and of being a vehicle for possible  Chinese espionage.
Some have called for CRRC’s exclusion from upcoming tenders for the Washington and New York subway systems.
Such criticisms have been greeted with bemusement in Springfield.
John Scavotto Jr, the leader of the local chapter of the sheet metal workers union, says the CRRC facility is a “godsend” — with high-paying jobs including benefits — but is worried about its future and is angry at the hostility coming from US President Donald Trump and Washington.
“This guy wants to have his war with China, let him have it, but leave us alone in Springfield,” he says, speaking of the US president. “I beg them to come down here from Washington and see for themselves what they’re trying to hurt, what they’re trying to quash, what they’re trying to make disappear.”
The furore over CRRC and its Massachusetts plant is emblematic of the increasingly febrile climate surrounding many Chinese investments in the US, at a time when the world’s two biggest economies are engaging in a process of decoupling that is driven by broader commercial and strategic tensions.
Chinese investment in the US has always been fairly controversial, even after the country’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001.
Oil company Cnooc’s proposed 2005 takeover of Unocal was scuppered in large part because of political opposition, and others have met similar fates since then.
Chinese foreign direct investment in the US did, however, increase over the years, hitting a peak of $46bn in 2016.
Since Mr Trump came into office, it has dropped sharply, to $29bn in 2017 and just $5bn in 2018, according to Rhodium Group.
A key driver of the decline emanated from Beijing, rather than Washington, following capital controls that reined in foreign acquisitions by many private Chinese entities.
But perceived US hostility has been another major spur, especially over the past year.
Chinese acquisitions of American companies in sensitive technological sectors are now routinely knocked back  on national security grounds by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.
Cfius also recently forced a Beijing-based company to  sell Grindr, the gay dating app, over fears of potential misuse of its trove of personal data.
CRRC’s initial Springfield investment, agreed after it won a contract in 2014 to supply Boston’s subway system with more than 280 cars, represents a rare instance of a Chinese greenfield manufacturing investment.
Such projects have trickled into the US at a rate of about $1bn a year since 2011 according to Rhodium.
The Springfield plant was precisely the type of investment that both Washington and Beijing welcomed at the time — a rare infusion of Chinese manufacturing dollars and knowhow in an industrial sector that no longer exists in the US.
Kevin Kennedy, the official in charge of Springfield’s economic development, calls the CRRC investment “a return to our manufacturing roots”.
After its breakthrough tender win in Boston over Canadian, Japanese and South Korean rivals in 2014, CRRC went on to secure subway car contracts in Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles between March 2016 and March 2017.
CRRC won the Boston tender with a bid of $557m, substantially below those of Hyundai Rotem （$721m）, Kawasaki （$905m） and Bombardier （$1bn）.
Those  four contract wins, secured during the final years of Barack Obama’s presidency and the first few months of Mr Trump’s, occurred in a markedly different phase in Sino-US relations.
Since Mr Trump signalled his intention in late 2017 to take a tougher line on Chinese trade and investment issues than his predecessors had, CRRC has lost at least three bids for railcar contracts, including two in New York and one in Atlanta.
China-made components that CRRC assembles in Springfield were targeted in Mr Trump’s first round of trade war tariffs, imposed in July 2018 on Chinese industrial exports worth about $50bn a year. When CRRC applied for an exemption from tariffs on China earlier this year, the request was rejected by the office of the US trade representative — despite dozens of letters of support for its relief petition from politicians, union officials, chambers of commerce and vocational schools in Massachusetts and California.
“CRRC’s first North American facility and its success is critical to our city and region’s economy, bringing back manufacturing and skilled labour,” Springfield mayor Domenic Sarno wrote.
“I am surprised by the knee-jerk reactions in the world of trade that have happened in this country under this president,” adds Mr Kennedy. “The business world wants you to be reliable and predictable and that’s how we, the mayor and I, try to do our business in Springfield . . . CRRC kept its word and created upwards of 200 jobs here in Massachusetts. Most of those are in Springfield and they’re looking at expansion. We have no complaints at all about the relationship.”
Outside of Massachusetts, the Chinese company has another US affiliate in Chicago, CRRC Sifang America, which is building rail cars for the subway system there and possibly the Washington metro, should it win that contract.
But as the company’s US presence has expanded, so has the political opposition.
CRRC’s most vocal critics on Capitol Hill include Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, and Marco Rubio, the Republican senator from Florida.
“This is part of China’s long-term strategy to undermine US industry and dominate the advanced technologies of the 21st century,” Mr Rubio wrote in the New York Post at the end of May.
A few days earlier, Mr Schumer had called for the US commerce department to probe whether CRRC posed a national security risk “given what we know about how cyberwarfare works”.
A small lobbying group called the Rail Security Alliance （RSA）, backed by some of America’s top freight rail companies, has been beating the drum hard about the dangers allegedly posed by CRRC. Its arguments range from suspicion that CRRC will eventually move on from passenger rail cars and dominate the US freight rail sector to worries about the state support it enjoys. “If they wanted to play by the same rules as France, Germany, Canada, Korea and Japan play by, fine,” RSA’s Erik Olson says. “But those aren’t the rules they play by. From an economic standpoint they are driven to produce jobs in China for the Chinese.”
The tariffs imposed on CRRC’s China-made components last July are having an impact. “We basically lost the Atlanta contract [in March] because of price, which is unusual,” says Russell Askalof, a former quality control manager at CRRC in Springfield. “Part of the reason we won so many of the other contracts was that CRRC [Massachusetts] was able to parlay the cheap labour in China that it uses to build the frame of the cars into a substantial discount for the total car.”
“Morale is pretty low right now,” adds Mr Askalof, who left the company last month. “People are very concerned about their jobs.”
As for the concerns about hacked subway cars, the RSA points to the advanced technology that is contained in modern rail cars, with sensors and systems used to track and regulate everything from temperature to location.
The allegation levelled against CRRC that it could be a vehicle for espionage strikes a particular nerve as the company enters the Washington Metro race.
“You have members of Congress, the intelligence community, Department of Defense officials, staff, whoever [riding the DC Metro],” says Mr Olson. “We don’t think CRRC will do anything nefarious and start a war or anything, but could they track people, could they use this as an intelligence gathering tool? One hundred per cent.”
Thilo Hanemann, a partner at Rhodium, says that protectionism has driven some of the backlash against Chinese companies. “There is a long list of Chinese greenfield projects in the US that [have been] attacked by special interest groups trying to protect their market and the current climate provides fertile ground for those campaigns,” he says. “It seems everyone is jumping on the red-scare bandwagon now.”
Jia Bo, vice-president of CRRC’s Massachusetts unit, rejects the criticisms from the RSA and lawmakers.
The rail cars built in Springfield, he says, abide by all the safety standards and procurement rules requiring that the majority of components are made in the US.
While the shells of the cars are indeed imported from a CRRC subsidiary in north-east China — and therefore subject to Mr Trump’s punitive tariffs — the high-value networking and monitoring systems are sourced from US, Japanese and German suppliers also used by CRRC rivals.
“I feel they are using this as an excuse to exclude us from the competition,” Mr Jia says.
He defends CRRC even more forcefully over the spying claims: safety cameras are installed to ensure the rail cars run securely and any data goes to the relevant transit authorities. “What they are saying, espionage, is a kind of speculation or an imaginary allegation,” he says. As for whether CRRC’s investment is now in jeopardy, he acknowledges that the company does “face a certain level of risk” and thinks the US and China both need “better communication”, but he does not believe the tension would be permanent. “The issues will be solved,” he says.
In Washington, CRRC does have one powerful defender in Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, which oversees taxes and trade. Mr Neal represents Springfield and its surrounding region and has been pushing back against some of the criticism. “There’s no question that the Chinese have a long history of actions that have threatened American jobs, technology and national security,” Mr Neal said last month. “However, it’s in our best interest, whenever possible, to strike the proper balance between protecting our national security and welcoming companies that create jobs and invest in our community. I believe we can do both.”
Kathy Brown, head of a neighbourhood council in Springfield, says she has not seen any evidence of opposition to, or scepticism about, CRRC in her meetings with residents — or even on local social media networks.
“It’s pretty exciting to watch one of those cars roll out and make their way down Page Boulevard [the Springfield street where CRRC is located],” she says.
Ollie Hall, a Springfield resident and military veteran, agrees that CRRC should not be targeted simply because it is a Chinese company. “We buy a lot of products from [Chinese companies], now they want to make trains,” Mr Hall says. “If they make them for this country, to help build this country, to make it a better country, who could it harm?”
Giovanni De Caro, a 43-year old electrical assembly and repair worker at CRRC’s plant who grew up in Springfield, says the investment “brought this part of the city back to life”. He is confident that the company can continue to win contracts in America. “I think other cities throughout the US, are going to say ‘OK, let’s see what [CRRC] can do for us’,” he says. “They’ll realise that [what] other people are saying about us isn’t true.”
Mr De Caro has little sympathy for Mr Trump’s trade war with China.
“I think it’s going to backfire. It will hurt us in the long run, and not just here at our company. All goods will get more expensive, so it’s going to be harder on working class families.”

Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, said Washington was “ready to engage” with Beijing ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump, the US president, and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at the G20 summit in Osaka, adding that there was a shared goal to “resolve” the trade dispute.
In congressional testimony on Tuesday, Mr Lighthizer said he had set up a “conversation” with his Chinese counterpart this week, to set the stage for the summit.
Mr Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, would then be meeting with Chinese officials in Japan to set the stage for the summit, he said.
“It’s in the interest of both China and the US to have some kind of a successful agreement, the president has said he definitely wants an agreement if we get a great agreement for America,” Mr Lighthizer said.
While he did not specify who he would be talking to in Beijing ahead of the summit, Mr Lighthizer and Mr Mnuchin have mainly been negotiating with Liu He, the Chinese vice-premier.
The resumption of trade discussions between the US and China follows a six-week break during which the two sides escalated tariffs and extended their economic confrontation to other areas, including export controls on sensitive technologies.
The prospect of ever-increasing levies and a decoupling of the world’s two largest economies had spooked many businesses on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, leading many to consider shifting their supply chains.
Mr Trump continued to dangle the possibility of a thaw at the G20 summit in Osaka late next week, and on Tuesday he spoke directly to Mr Xi to confirm that a bilateral meeting would take place.
“Had a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China. We will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan. Our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting,” Mr Trump tweeted on Tuesday.

Investors’ desire for greater exposure to China has led to record demand for derivatives tied to the big benchmark indices that track the country’s stocks.
Traders and investors have long been accustomed to using FTSE A50 futures contracts at SGX, the Singapore exchange, which tracks China’s biggest and most liquid blue-chip stocks.
But that benchmark is now being joined by other contracts allowing investors to bet on stock prices, down the track, as China moves to make its capital markets more accessible to international investors.
The most popular contract has been futures based on MSCI’s flagship Emerging Markets Index, in which China equities have the heaviest weighting. About $2tn of assets around the world are tied to it.
At Intercontinental Exchange, which operates the deepest derivatives market, outstanding positions in MSCI EM index futures have more than doubled since 2014 and hit more than 1.85m lots, worth a notional $85bn, in March.
Similar contracts at Deutsche Börse’s Eurex have soared from virtually nothing in 2016 to open positions worth €17bn.
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing also plans to offer MSCI futures for China, if it receives regulatory approval.
Antoine Porcheret, director of equity trading strategy at Citi, said the market had grown rapidly since 2016 — apparently undisturbed by the ongoing trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.
“The rationale for the allocation into emerging markets is that investors are looking for higher growth. It’s as simple as that.”
In March, recognising investors’ shifting preferences, MSCI  said it would give China a greater weighting in its indices.
Analysts estimate that the index provider’s move could send as much as $125bn flowing into Chinese stocks.
Open interest in MSCI EM-linked futures at ICE has dipped in recent weeks to 1.28m contracts, or a notional $65bn, as investors prepare for the current contract’s expiry on June 21 and move into the one that expires in September.
As China continues to open up, that total looks likely to rise again.

The glaciers of the Himalayas are melting at an accelerating rate, according to a study that underscores the impact of climate change on an area that is a critical source of water supply for India and China.
The glaciers have been losing the equivalent of 50cm of ice vertically each year since 2000, melting twice as fast as they were during the 1975 to 2000 period, according to a forthcoming study in Science Advances that surveys 40 years of satellite data.
The impact of Himalayan glacial melting is significant because the region provides water to about 800m people across Asia, who depend on seasonal run-off when the ice melts in the spring.
Melting glaciers along the mountain range have meant there has been more water run-off than normal during spring in recent years.
However, this trend is expected to reverse in future as the glaciers shrink — potentially leading to drought.
The research comes as global carbon dioxide emissions hit a record high last year, and as the earth’s average temperature has warmed about 1C compared with pre-industrial times.
“The reason we focused on this section of high mountain Asia is because Himalayan glaciers are so important for water resources,” said Joshua Maurer, lead author of the study and a PhD candidate at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
“The correlation we observe between rising air temperature and the acceleration of glacial melt over the last four decades highlights how vulnerable these glaciers are to climate change and to atmospheric warming,” he added.
Concerns over the impact of warmer temperatures on the world’s ice stores have been rising as the effects become more visible.
Earlier this month, unusually warm weather in Greenland led to record melting levels.
In the Bering Sea ice levels also reached record winter lows earlier this year.
The glaciers currently contain about 600bn tons of ice but have lost about a quarter of their mass over the four decades surveyed, according to Mr Maurer.
A growing body of research has documented how melting glaciers will impact the long-term water supplies on which hundreds of millions of people across Asia depend.
A different study, published last month in Nature, found that the level of meltwater production from Himalayan glaciers is about 1.6 times greater than the rate that would keep the glaciers in “balance”.
During times of drought glaciers become the largest suppliers of water to Asia’s major river basin, that study found.
It calculated that each year the glaciers release enough water to meet the basic needs of about 220m people.
Several factors contribute to glacial melting in the Himalayas, including soot that settles on top of glaciers, as well as changing precipitation factors.
However, the new study in Science Advances suggests that temperature is the single biggest factor that drives the rate of melting.
“The ice loss that we see across the region is quite similar, so that tells us that there is a climate driver that causes these glaciers to melt similarly,” said Mr Maurer.
The study uses satellite images from 1975-2016, including spy satellite images that were recently declassified, to analyse the mass of Himalayan glaciers across a 2,000km stretch that covers India, China, Nepal and Bhutan.
Since 2000, the rate of loss across all the glaciers has been the equivalent of about 50cm of ice on average annually, with much greater ice loss occurring at lower elevations.

Facebook’s plans to launch a new global digital currency drew an immediate response from regulators on Tuesday, with the Group of Seven nations saying it would set up a high-level forum to examine the risks of such currencies to the financial system.
The G7 working group will also consider how to ensure proper controls against money-laundering, according to a letter from Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, and François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France.
The French hold the rotating presidency of the G7.
Central banks and the International Monetary Fund will also participate, according to the letter, which was seen by the Financial Times.
The news came after Facebook revealed the details of a new currency, called Libra and supported by more than two dozen companies and groups, from Visa and Mastercard to Vodafone and Uber.
Facebook said the currency would be backed by hard assets, a basket of currencies and securities to ensure trust and a stable value.
Users would be able to make instant and nearly free international money transfers from their mobile phones.
In response, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said international scrutiny would be brought to bear on Facebook’s plans and that the BoE greeted the ambitions “with an open mind” but not “an open door”.
Mr Carney said at a meeting of central bankers in Portugal that if Facebook was successful in attracting users “it would instantly become systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulation”.
The BoE, the UK Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority have already held detailed tripartite discussions about Facebook’s ambitions and consequences on the UK regulatory and policy landscape, according to people familiar with the situation.
None of the authorities would comment.
Benoît Cœuré, a member of the European Central Bank’s executive board and one of the front-runners to succeed Mario Draghi as ECB president, is set to co-ordinate the G7 working group, with the first report expected in a month.
The group “will look into a range of challenges raised by the emergence of stable coins, including on the regulatory front”, stated the letter, which did not single out Libra.
It detailed “financial stability risks （possible systemic consequences of broad-based use of stable coins, consumer protection, and spillover and surveillance issues）” as well as “monetary policy transmission issues （substitution effects with legal tender, possible interest payments on stable coins and relation to official interest rate）”.
The swift wave of scrutiny from regulators and policymakers will be a blow to Facebook, which hoped for a regulatory light touch.
The technology group is already under fire from regulators and politicians around the world regarding the handling of personal data among other issues.
Facebook said in its launch documents on Tuesday: “The success of this venture depends on its trusted and safe integration with the existing financial system. The world’s governments, specifically regulatory and law-enforcement authorities, are essential partners in this endeavour.”

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman should be investigated over the grisly murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi because there is “credible evidence” that he and other senior Saudi officials were responsible, a UN report has concluded.
After a six-month probe, Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, said in the report that Khashoggi was the “victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible under international human rights law”.
Ms Callamard said the UN inquiry into Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi journalist who had lived in self-imposed exile in the US, had shown “sufficient credible evidence regarding the responsibility of the crown prince demanding further investigation”.
The 101-page report provided a dozen recommendations, including a call for UN secretary-general António Guterres to launch a criminal investigation.
Saudi Arabia said the report included “clear contradictions and baseless claims” and was “nothing new”.
Riyadh has been desperate to put the murder of Khashoggi — whose body Turkish and Saudi officials said was dismembered after he was killed — behind it and to refocus attention on Prince Mohammed’s reform programme.
The crown prince has denied any involvement in Khashoggi’s death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.
Riyadh has put 11 Saudi suspects on trial.
Ms Callamard was granted access to some recordings of conversations inside the consulate, according to the report, but she was not allowed to obtain a copy.
She noted the “extreme sensitivity” of considering the criminal responsibility of the crown prince and his top aide Saud al-Qahtani, a senior Saudi adviser who has not been charged.
“No conclusion is made as to guilt,” Ms Callamard wrote.
“The only conclusion made is that there is credible evidence meriting further investigation, by a proper authority, as to whether the threshold of criminal responsibility has been met” for the two men.
Mr Qahtani, who was considered the crown prince’s enforcer, is among more than a dozen Saudi officials sanctioned by the US and several European countries after Khashoggi’s killing.
Ms Callamard recommended that the sanctions should also target “the crown prince and his personal assets abroad”.
The report recounts recordings of conversations inside the consulate on the day of Khashoggi’s killing, including a discussion about cutting up his body minutes before he arrived.
“The body is heavy,” said one Saudi official.
“If we take plastic bags and cut it into pieces, it will be finished. We will wrap each of them.”
Khashoggi is also recorded saying: “There is a towel here. Are you going to give me drugs?” A Saudi official replies: “We will anaesthetise you.”

When it comes to his country’s relationship with Mexico, US president Donald Trump has decided to take a position that is at once reckless and suicidal.
Reckless, because he is single-handedly scuttling a bilateral relationship with a nation that is vital to the prosperity, security and wellbeing of the US.
Suicidal, because the punitive tariffs he threatened on all Mexican imports a little over two weeks ago would only boomerang and smack America in the face.
The lessons from what is surely the gravest diplomatic crisis between the nations since the murder of an undercover US Drug Enforcement Administration agent on Mexican soil in 1985 are worrisome.
First, there’s the resounding message to the world that the US cannot be trusted in any negotiation （despite having just finalised the revamp of a new regional trade agreement）.
Second, they are a reminder of what happens when Mr Trump is allowed to continue weaponising trade policy.
Third, they underscore that he will continue to conduct foreign affairs by means of tirades, ultimatums and tantrums.
The US president will never grasp why tariffs on Mexican exports are a self-inflicted wound.
The integrated supply chains and joint production platforms that have been built in North America over more than 20 years of regional trade mean that out of every dollar that Mexico exports to the US, 40 cents are American inputs.
So a 5 per cent tariff on Mexican exports is also a 5 per cent tariff on their US parts.
The effects would be felt on everything from beer and avocados to medical instruments, heavy machinery, cars and aerospace components.
A 5 per cent tariff on all imports coming to the US from Mexico would lead to an increase in direct costs to American consumers and businesses of about $28.1bn each year.
And if Mexico were to retaliate, as it successfully did last year with a carousel of surgical countervailing duties designed to extract the highest economic and political cost at the congressional district and state levels, the pain would be widespread in Republican states.
No wonder Republicans in Congress, governors and business associations swiftly mobilised to criticise the president and force him to back down; this time around it was clearly a tariff too far.
But Mr Trump’s threat was not really about tariffs. It was about ransoming North American trade to prise concessions from Mexico on immigration policy, which he could then sell to his base as proof of his hardline stance on migrants, refugees and border security.
You cannot enforce your way out of a migration crisis and the US president was not truly searching for a deal; what he really wants is a trophy.
Mexico is a prop in a narrative controlled by Mr Trump, and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador would do well to remember this.
While Mexico has been behaving like the adult in this relationship, seeking to de-escalate tension every time Mr Trump makes a new threat and appeasing the White House to avoid a worse outcome, that should not be conflated with good policy.
Mr López Obrador should not blink and kowtow as both countries ascertain whether Mexico’s efforts to deter Central American transmigration have worked.
But if Mr Trump does return to the warpath, Mexico needs to hold the line and work with its many allies and stakeholders in the US to pile political pressure on the White House.
It should also reinstate its retaliatory duties on everything from agricultural exports and Christmas trees to Bourbon and motorcycles, and let US consumers and businesses bear the brunt of their president’s decisions.
In the coming weeks and months, while Mr Trump plays checkers, Mexico will need to play chess.
The US has had the luxury of an ally nation at its southern border for decades.
Wrecking the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, and its political and economic foundations, will have a hugely detrimental impact on the bilateral relationship that has been built so painstakingly since the creation of Nafta and in the aftermath of 9-11.
Mr Trump should be very careful what he wishes for.

American parents report that their children are speaking with English accents and using British words — “mummy” rather than “mommy” — after watching the UK animated television series Peppa Pig.
And last week the website Not One-Off Britishisms, which tracks the movement of UK words to the US, reported an increased use of the British parliamentary term “backbencher” to describe American politicians.
The recent surge has been prompted by the election to Congress of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with the sceptics saying that for all the attention she gets “she’s just a backbencher”.
I contribute to the study of transatlantic word-swaps by noting the phrases that go the other way.
In January I wrote about the rise of the US-style “ advocating for” in UK press reports （“advocating for a second referendum”） when for decades simply “advocating” had been enough.
What is curious about “advocating for” is that it takes more effort; there is an additional preposition.
But I have also been noticing two American phrases that Brits increasingly use that drop the preposition.
How do you describe the work waiters do? My New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary says that in Britain waiters “wait at tables”. In North America, they “wait tables”.
But there is now a noticeable increase in Brits “waiting tables”.
In the 15 years from 1984 until 1999, there were 88 uses of “wait tables” or “waiting tables” in UK national newspapers, according to the Factiva database.
Last year alone there were 72.
Even new members of the royal family are at it — the work, not the phrase. When Princess Eugenie, grand-daughter to the Queen, married Jack Brooksbank last year, the Daily Telegraph reported that the two had met on a Swiss ski trip while the princess was a Newcastle University student and the groom was “waiting tables and serving drinks at Devonshire Terrace, a bar and restaurant near Liverpool Street in London”.
Is there a history of using “wait tables” rather than “wait at tables” in the UK? The full OED indicates that, in England, it has been “wait at table” since 1568, with Jane Austen, for example, writing in Pride and Prejudice in 1813: “She had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table.”
“Wait table” does have a history in Scotland, with Robert Louis Stevenson writing in St Ives （published in 1898）: “We had a good many pleasant passages as she waited table or warmed my bed for me.”
The other US immigrant into UK English is “working two jobs” rather than “working in two jobs” or “doing two jobs”.
Factiva shows that no UK national paper used “work” or “worked” or “working two （or three） jobs” until 1994.
In the following five years it appeared only 21 times.
Last year alone, it appeared 151 times.
In the OED, the only examples of the “working two jobs” form are American, so this does seem to be an innovation in the UK.
Why have “waiting tables” and “working two jobs” become so popular?
They usually appear in the context of having a hard time, striving to get ahead, or just keep one’s head above water.
An article in the Observer last year about the challenges of being a student nurse quoted one saying: “I know trainee nurses who wait tables or work in pubs after being on their feet all day.”
A profile in the Guardian of British footballers’ wives says of one, Leanne Brown, that “her upbringing, in a small village in Cumbria, was tough. Her mother worked three jobs, and her father left the family home when Leanne was 13.”
Is it austerity or the difficulty of paying for decent housing that has caused the adoption of these hardscrabble American terms?
Probably not.
The UK has seen harder times than these.
Or the globalisation of celebrity culture, in show business or just business, where Americans who have “waited tables” or “worked two jobs” achieve the fame they were seeking? For example, when Betsy Duke was appointed chair of Wells Fargo in 2017, the Financial Times reported that, fresh out of drama school, she took her first banking job as a drive-through teller while “still working at a dinner theatre and waiting tables on weekends”.
Again, probably not.
Global celebrity has been around for decades.
Possibly “waiting tables” or “working two jobs” just sound cool, or sophisticated, the way “backbencher” does to Americans.

Less than 10 years ago, all top 10 technology companies by revenue were American.
Global telecom standards were set by US companies such as AT&T and Verizon.
Today, by contrast, four of the top 10 internet firms are Chinese.
A decade ago, Huawei, the leading Chinese telecoms equipment maker, was a little known provider of services largely to south-east Asia, and eastern and central Europe, rather than a rival to the Americans in more developed markets. Its revenues amounted to some $28bn in 2009. Last year they reached $107bn.
Friction between the US and China, which seemed to have its origins in trade disputes, has moved on.
Today telecoms and wireless technology are at the forefront of the competitive sparring between the two countries.
In a world where everything is dual-use technology, it is increasingly hard to distinguish what is commercial and civilian and what is strategic and military.
And technology, unlike trade, does not easily lend itself to concessions at the negotiating table.
To have the technological edge is existential for both countries.
“There is an even bigger long-term risk facing the world economy than the current trade war. That is the very negative implications of the current US stance against Huawei,” notes Chris Wood, equity strategist for Jefferies in Hong Kong. “The origin of America’s ultra-aggressive stance remains a determination that China will not dominate in 5G or other emerging technologies.”
Yet if no less a source than the Defense Innovation Board, launched in 2016 to help bring innovation and independent advice to the Pentagon, is to be believed, the US is behind in developing the latest technology and in setting global standards for 5G. That is according to an assessment of the prospects of the two national giants in a report on the 5G Ecosystem the board released in April.
The report portrays a technological world in which the US, far from dominating, is in danger of becoming ever more marginal.
“The country that owns 5G will own many innovations and set the standards for the rest of the world. That country is currently not likely to be the United States,” the report concludes starkly.
“Chinese equipment is cheaper （and） in many cases is superior to its western rivals.”
One Chinese venture capitalist says he takes this as an affirmation that “we won”.
The introduction of 5G is a big deal, both in itself and because of its multiplier effect on a range of other technologies including autonomous vehicles, the internet of things, smart cities, virtual reality and, battlefields, whether physical or in cyber space.
The companies or countries that are the first movers will set global standards.
That in turn brings hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues, substantial job creation and leadership in any other technologies that require ever swifter transmission of data, the board notes.
“In the early 2010s, AT&T and Verizon took the lead in rapidly deploying next generation technology that improved on 3G technology. US companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix then built new applications and services . . . and helped drive global US dominance in wireless and internet services,” it states.
Today, though, the US has lost its edge when it comes to telecoms technology for reasons that have little to do with any possible predatory behaviour either from Beijing or Huawei, which today has become a national champion of China, in part because of attacks from the White House and Congress.
Part of the problem is lack of investment.
China has spent $180bn over the past five years and has 10 times as many base stations as the US.
American companies including Verizon and AT&T have too much debt to undertake the huge investment necessary to build out the numbers of base stations required, the report notes, while other western firms, such as Nokia and Ericsson, have also seen their fortunes decline.
Another obstacle is the fact that in the US, the government and the military appropriate most of the spectrum being used by the rest of the world for commercial purposes, leaving the US market isolated.
By themselves, the US markets, both civilian and military, are no longer big enough to dictate to others or to prevent Chinese 5G from continuing to increase market share globally.
The larger question of course is whether what is true in telecoms becomes true on a wider scale.
Meanwhile, the effect of any US sanctions against Huawei or others is likely to only accelerate Beijing’s efforts to achieve self-sufficiency.

President Donald Trump has ordered 1,000 more US troops to the Middle East amid heightening tension with Iran as Tehran threatens steps that could spark the complete collapse of the landmark nuclear deal signed in 2015.
Patrick Shanahan, acting US defence secretary, said the Pentagon was deploying the forces for “defensive purposes to address air, naval and ground-based threats in the Middle East”.
The move followed a decision last month to send 1,500 troops to the region because of unspecified threats from Iran.
Mr Trump had previously warned Iran of “severe” consequences if the Islamic Republic targeted US forces.
Mr Shanahan said the deployment of additional troops was to protect American personnel in the area.
“The United States does not seek conflict with Iran. The action today is being taken to ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region and to protect our national interests,” he added.
Hours after the announcement, Beijing added its voice to international concerns about the escalating friction.
Wang Yi, the Chinese government’s top diplomat, said on Tuesday that the US should “change its maximum pressure tactics” in the Middle East or risk creating a greater crisis.
“China calls on all sides to be rational and restrained. Do not again take any steps to worsen the situation. Do not open Pandora’s box,” he said, according to Chinese state media reports, adding that the US and Iran “must not allow this vicious cycle to slide into conflict”.
China is Iran’s biggest buyer of oil and a signatory to the nuclear accord.
Beijing’s position is crucial to the Islamic republic’s ability to sell crude and withstand the US pressure.
Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, said on Tuesday that Tehran would not fight a war against another country.
“This confrontation will end with victory for our country,” he said, according to state television.
“We will not wage any war with any nation since those confronting us . . . are a bunch of politicians with little experience.”

China has the world’s third-largest number of cat and dog owners.
Keeping pets flea-free is a priority.
Acquisitive Chinese investment group Fosun International is reportedly on the lookout for ways to capitalise on the trend by considering a bid for the animal health business of German chemicals company Bayer, known for flea-and-tick fighter Advantage.
The unit would be an appealing asset — but it could prove costly for Fosun.
Bayer has good reason to sell.
Shareholders are impatient for action following problems it has encountered since its controversial $63bn takeover last year of US seeds and chemicals group Monsanto.
US court cases linking a Monsanto weed killer to cancer have opened up the possibility of billions of dollars in damages.
Bayer’s shares have fallen 45 per cent in the past year and trade at a near seven-year low.
Selling the animal health business would be part of a wider restructuring process.
For Fosun, it is a good time to expand an animal health business.
In China, spending on pets is expected to reach $7bn by next year, according to consultancy Euromonitor.
While general spending on pets has increased, the amount spent on pet healthcare has lagged.
Medical care costs are a fifth of the total — compared to over a half in the US.
That leaves ample room for growth.
Bayer’s animal health unit generated ebitda of around $400m last year and in 2017.
For this, the company is thought to be seeking an €8bn （$9bn） price, meaning that it would be valued at an enterprise value-to-ebitda multiple of 23 times — a 15 per cent premium to peers like Elanco Animal Health.
Fosun could accelerate sales in China and expand Bayer’s business in Asia — where most of the unit’s growth came from last year — but the effort required does not justify the premium.
The Chinese government has previously placed limits on overseas investments that it deems too large.
Even if the deal does not fall under a specific ban it is more than Fosun should pay.

It is a picture that has probably been seen around the world.
A winding queue of climbers and their guides apparently shuffling towards the summit of the highest mountain in the world.
The unprecedented traffic jam has raised important questions about the nature of tourism around Mount Everest.
The image is even more jarring when you consider the news that spring 2019 will be the deadliest climbing season in recent history: so far 11 climbers have died on the mountain.
When you look at the picture and think about those numbers, you have to wonder if a selfie on the summit is worth it.
In April 2019, I had a similar thought while slowly losing control of my lungs and then my consciousness in Lobuche on the Everest base camp trail.
For every person attempting the 8,848m summit there are thousands further below braving frigid temperatures to make it to EBC.
Even at a modest 5,380m, the EBC trek is challenging, as the bare rocky surface of the surrounding mountains intensifies the cold and snow, thinning out the air much faster than in mountains of a similar height.
I had expected a relaxed 21-day trek to a beautiful view.
Instead, half way in and after a week of powering up and down the trail to make up for a lost travel day, I was gasping for air, losing consciousness and reciting the alphabet backwards to keep my mind awake.
My experience in Lobuche brought me into contact with both the beautiful and the ugly side of climbing season in the Khumbu Himalaya region.
The political economy of the region is complex for reasons beyond simple numbers.
The initial reaction of many to seeing the picture of the summit traffic is probably correct — there are simply too many people on the mountain. But the dense crowds are there because of the popularity of certain routes over others, particularly Everest. Almost no one knows what you mean when you say you climbed Ama Dablam, an imposing 6,812m peak that dominates much of the EBC trail. But Everest is on every climber’s bucket list.
The Khumbu Himalaya region attracts more than 35,000 people every year.
Extreme changes in weather mean that most of them attempt the trek either in the peak spring period, in April and May, or in November and December.
For safety reasons, the trails are fixed, connecting village to village in a set pattern, which only intensifies overcrowding.
And while there are checkpoints and permit offices dotted along the route, it is impossible for officials to police the entire area.
As in any other large tourism market, this offers opportunities for unscrupulous guides and travel agents who are willing to take inexperienced, wealthy clients wherever they want to go, regardless of the risk.
The result is that you feel you are on a conveyor belt rather than having a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
You are competing with your body and weather that turns nasty every afternoon, as well as with hyper-competitive climbers trying to prove a point.
This changes how people perceive and respond to threats.
For instance in April, flu swept through the EBC trail causing many to experience breathing problems.
But in cases like this there is no time to stop, and some guides can be insensitive to complaints of ill health for fear of slowing down the conveyor belt.
The result is that many people self-medicate their way up and down the mountain.
Scammers have noticed.
Last year, journalists exposed an insurance scam involving the helicopters that bring supplies part way up the mountain, guides and tour companies.
The resulting climate of suspicion perhaps explains why insurance companies are often reluctant to respond to legitimate requests for help like mine.
I felt like I was dying, but I still had to push my oxygen tank aside so I could argue about evacuation with someone in a call centre in Australia.
That is what it’s like on Everest today.
You are exhausted, slightly delirious and constantly having to make life or death decisions.
And it only gets worse the higher up you go.
It follows that simply reducing the number of climbing permits issued each year will not solve the problem.
Some of the risks one encounters on Everest are structural, given the nature of the mountain and the kind of people it attracts.
Similarly, a marginal rise in the price of permits might help, but raise the fee too much and the impact on Nepal would be devastating.
Tourism is the largest sector of the Nepalese economy, with most activity concentrated on the mountain ranges that hem in the country on all sides.
Each climber supports at least six to eight people — guides, porters, travel agents, hotels and teashop owners — for at least a quarter of the year.
Then there are the secondary markets in souvenirs or transport.
There is a much simpler solution.
Nepal has a huge number of mountains for climbers of all abilities to attempt.
It’s time for people to go somewhere other than Everest.

Sub-Saharan Africa’s population is set to double over the next 30 years, adding an additional 1bn people and putting it on track to overtake central and south Asia soon after as the world’s most populous region.
The high fertility rates south of the Sahara mean that region of Africa will account for more than half of global population growth between now and 2050, according to projections from the UN Population Division report released on Monday.
The region’s population will still be rising fast at the end of the century, when the number of people living in much of Asia and elsewhere will be in decline.
The trend is exemplified by Nigeria, whose population has already surged from 95m in 1990 to 201m this year.
Nigeria’s population is set to double again to more than 400m by 2050, when it will have overtaken the US as the world’s third most inhabited country.
In Niger, where women on average have seven children, the highest birth rate in the world, the population is projected to almost triple to 66m over the same time period.
“In 2050 it is expected that Niger will be the only country in the world experiencing a fertility level greater than four births per woman over a lifetime,” the report said.
Liu Zhenmin, UN head of economic and social affairs, commented: “Many of the fastest growing populations are in the poorest countries, where population growth brings additional challenges in the effort to eradicate poverty, achieve greater equality, combat hunger and malnutrition and strengthen . . . health and education systems.”
The report predicted the number of human inhabitants in the world would grow from 7.7bn today to 9.7bn in 2050 and 10.9bn in 2100.
“The global population continues to grow, but the rate of increase is slower today than at any time since 1950 and we expect it to continue to slow over the coming decades,” said Thomas Spoorenberg, UN population affairs officer.
Demographic experts analysed trends in fertility, mortality and migration for a year to come up with the projections, which are slightly below the previous estimates issued two years ago.
India is expected to overtake China as the world’s most populous country in or near 2027.
By 2050, India with 1.6bn people will be well ahead of China whose population will then be back at the 2019 level of 1.4bn.
Pakistan’s population, which stands at 217m, is one of the fastest growing outside Africa and a projected 338m in 2050.
At the other extreme, some places are experiencing population decline as a result of low fertility and high emigration rates.
Twenty-seven countries have fewer inhabitants now than in 2010 and the number expected to experience a decline between today and 2050 is 55.
Population is falling fastest in eastern Europe, where Lithuania stands out with a decline of 12 per cent between 2010 and 2019 and a further decrease of 27 per cent projected from now to 2050.
Although fertility and death rates drive global population changes, migration to escape violence or poverty can have a large local impact. Syria is the most striking example, recording a 20 per cent population decline since 2010 as a result of people fleeing the civil war.
Puerto Rico has lost 17 per cent of its inhabitants since 2010 through emigration and is expected to lose another 17 per cent over the next 30 years.
The US has gained the most immigrants over the past 10 years — about 10m people — and Germany has added 5m.
People also continue to live longer, the UN report showed.
Average life expectancy at birth increased from 64.2 years in 1990 to 72.6 in 2019 and is expected to increase further to 77.1 in 2050.
The longevity differential between rich and poor countries has been closing, though life expectancy in the least developed countries is still 7.4 years behind the global average, due largely to high levels of child and maternal mortality, as well as violence, conflict and the continuing impact of the Aids epidemic.
Robin Maynard, director of Population Matters, a UK-based charity, welcomed the slight downwards adjustment in population projections. “But these figures nail the myth that population is going to decline soon,” he said. “There is only a one-in-four chance of that happening by the end of the century.”

Chancellor Philip Hammond on Monday defied US pressure to take a tougher line with Beijing, describing China as a “crucial bilateral partner” with a “vital role” in championing the rules-based multilateral order.
Speaking on Monday after talks in London with Chinese vice-premier Hu Chunhua, Mr Hammond suggested Britain could make common cause with China to defend the international trading system against the threat of rising US protectionism.
“Britain is a very open trading economy,” he told reporters. “We are very vulnerable to anything that impacts on global trade or growth in the global economy. It’s vital that we forge a relationship with China that works both for trade and for investment.”
Mr Hu said China and the UK would work together to make the World Trade Organization more effective and to strengthen the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank — the Chinese-led institution that Britain joined in the teeth of US criticism.
The UK has also angered Washington by approving in principle China’s Huawei providing kit for Britain’s fifth-generation mobile phone networks, although a final government decision has not been made amid US concerns that the equipment could enable spying by Beijing.
Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, delivered an outspoken attack last month on the UK’s stance, suggesting that the Conservative government was betraying the legacy of Margaret Thatcher through its work with Huawei, and its support for China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
Mr Hammond refused to be drawn on whether the UK would give final approval to Huawei’s involvement in Britain’s 5G networks, saying that current arrangements with the Chinese company had worked well.
However, Mr Hammond confirmed the UK’s ambition to play a bigger part in financing China’s controversial infrastructure initiatives — often blamed for creating debt traps for host countries.
The aim was to develop a platform through which UK companies could invest in “bankable” projects, provided they met international social, environmental and governance standards, he said.
The meeting in London also resulted in an agreement to widen UK farmers’ access to Chinese markets for beef and pork, where consumers face steep price increases after a swine-fever epidemic.
Other deals announced alongside the launch of a new link between the London and Shanghai stock exchanges included plans for China’s Industrial Bank to open a new office in the UK capital, and an agreement to develop a digital payment platform to expand issuance and acceptance of UnionPay cards outside mainland China.

Donald Trump formally launched his 2020 re-election campaign in Florida where he said his victory three years ago was a “defining moment in American history” and vowed to maintain his America First policy
“Exactly four years ago this week I announced my campaign for the [office of] president . . . It turned out to be a great political movement,” Mr Trump said. “It’s a movement, made up of hard-working patriots who love their country, love their flag, love their children. I do believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first.”
Mr Trump has held dozens of political rallies since he assumed office in January 2017. But the Tuesday evening event in Florida, a key swing state, marked the formal start of a re-election campaign that will see him battle against one of the 23 Democrats vying to run against him next year.
Underscoring the power of incumbency, Trump fans filled the 20,000-seat arena in Orlando where people wielded placards saying “Four More Years”.
Ahead of the rally, Mr Trump sparked more controversy about immigration by saying that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency would next week conduct raids aimed at finding and deporting millions of people who live in the US without the proper documentation.
“Next week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in,” Mr Trump tweeted.
The US has continued to see a sharp uptick of border apprehensions in recent months, although there have been signs of a slowdown in recent weeks.
In May the US apprehended over 144,000 individuals — the highest such monthly figure in more than a decade.
During the 2016 campaign, Mr Trump stoked fears by warning about rapists and murderers entering the US from Mexico, and vowed to build a wall on the border.
He adopted a similar approach before the 2018 midterm elections by warning voters that a “caravan” of people from Central America was winding its way through Mexico in the hope of reaching the US.
His renewed focus on immigration sets the stage for a presidential race where Mr Trump stresses the need to reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the US, while the Democrats vying to win their party’s presidential nomination stress the need to take a more humane approach.
Over the past few months Mr Trump has focused his presidential political attacks on Joe Biden, the former vice-president who is leading the polls in the Democratic primary.
Many experts believe that Mr Biden is still benefiting from strong name recognition that has given him an early boost in the race.
According to an average of recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics, Mr Biden leads the Democratic primary race with 32 per cent, followed by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on 15 per cent.
Mr Sanders has fallen as Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has risen to 12 per cent, and in some polls overtaken him.
The top three are followed by South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, with 7 per cent, California senator Kamala Harris also with 7 per cent, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke with 4 per cent and New Jersey senator Cory Booker with 2 per cent.
A slew of recent polls have shown several of the Democrats beating Mr Trump in a head-to-head race, but many experts say that such surveys are largely pointless coming just under a year and a half before the election.

Sotheby’s has gone under the hammer for $3.7bn, ending 31 years of public ownership, with the venerable auction house sold to Patrick Drahi, the billionaire founder of telecoms group Altice.
The deal concludes frantic negotiations that began with an unsolicited approach from Mr Drahi.
The Franco-Israeli entrepreneur collects art and has been looking to raise his profile outside the telecoms industry where he has made his fortune, according to a person who worked on the sale.
His purchase means the world’s two largest auction houses will be owned by French billionaires, with Sotheby’s rival Christie’s bought by the Pinault family’s holding company two decades ago.
The sale marks a high point in the art market, which has rebounded in spectacular fashion since the fallow years that followed the financial crisis. Sotheby’s and Christie’s have held a series of record-breaking auctions, capped by Christie’s $450m sale of a contested Leonardo da Vinci work in 2017. There have also been blockbuster sales of works by David Hockney, Claude Monet and Jeff Koons.
Sotheby’s shareholders will receive $57 a share from BidFair, Mr Drahi’s holding company — a 61 per cent premium to the company’s most recent closing price but below an all-time high before the financial crisis in 2007.
The sale follows several activist interventions in Sotheby’s as the company’s performance languished.
It attracted a blistering public attack from hedge fund managers Dan Loeb and Mick McGuire, with the latter accusing it of “wilful neglect” in 2015.
Mr Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund is Sotheby’s second-biggest shareholder with a 14.3 per cent stake.
In 2013 the investor lambasted Sotheby’s senior management who, he claimed, “feasted on organic delicacies and imbibed vintage wines at a cost to shareholders of multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars”.
Mr Loeb said yesterday that Third Point was “pleased to have played a role” in the company’s turnround.
Mr Drahi is best known for his activity in telecoms and media over the past two decades, where he has used debt-fuelled acquisitions to build Altice, a telecoms and media group that expanded from its French roots to the US, Portugal, Israel and the Dominican Republic.
Last year Altice spun off its US business and restructured its European operations after poor results heightened concerns over its ability to service its then €50bn debt pile.
Since then Altice’s US arm has performed better but the European business continues to struggle in France, its largest market.
Sotheby’s generated $109m of net profit last year on revenues of $1.04bn; both figures were down on 2017, despite the value of works that it sold rising 16 per cent to $6.4bn.
Domenico De Sole, chairman of Sotheby’s, said that the board “enthusiastically” supported Mr Drahi’s offer

Xi Jinping will travel to North Korea to meet Kim Jong Un this week, in the first visit by a Chinese president to the country since 2005.
The meeting comes at a tense juncture, with talks between the US and North Korea over denuclearisation and sanctions stalled and Washington and Beijing locked in a fierce battle over trade and technology.
Mr Xi’s visit, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, will mark the fifth time the two leaders have met in office since their first meeting in Beijing last year.
Relations between the US and North Korea have worsened in recent months after Mr Trump and Mr Kim held a second summit in Hanoi in February that collapsed.
North Korea in May launched several short-range ballistic missiles, conducting tests of such weapons for the first time since 2017 and further complicating efforts to resume talks.
Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Mr Xi’s decision to visit Pyongyang this week could “indicate a breakdown in mutual restraint” between Washington and Beijing, ahead of the G20 summit in Japan this month.
“It had appeared that Xi was waiting to move on North Korea, and the Trump administration was pulling punches on human rights and on sanctioning new Chinese entities, to allow space to negotiate a ceasefire in the trade war,” Mr Easley said.
“On the other hand, if Xi is able to leverage his visit to secure new denuclearisation commitments from Kim, the result could be a convenient diplomatic opening for Washington and Beijing as well as Seoul and Pyongyang.”
Despite the series of meetings between Mr Xi and Mr Kim in 2018 and 2019, ties between China and North Korea have also been tested after Beijing joined the US-led effort to impose tough economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Mr Xi’s visit would help “turn a new page” in China’s ties with North Korea, with discussions on how to “achieve new progress on finding a political solution to the Korean peninsula issue”, the International Liaison Department of China’s Communist Party said in a briefing.
“Both sides urge the relevant parties to treasure the hard-won positive momentum of dialogue and to maintain the direction towards denuclearisation on the peninsula,” Chinese state media reported the department as saying, in a likely reference to the US.
Darcie Draudt, a Seoul-based researcher at the Johns Hopkins University, said Mr Xi’s visit marked “a big change for North Korea” after Mr Kim in 2018 pursued new channels with Seoul and Washington.
“Kim Jong Un is likely seeking greater political and economic engagement with Beijing, which has historically been its greatest ally,” she said.
“From the point of view of Washington, the closer Pyongyang moves to Beijing, the more difficult it will be for Trump to play his characteristic one-on-one personality politics with Kim Jong Un down the line.”
Zhang Baohui, a professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, said it was difficult to interpret the motivations behind the meeting given the “secrecy of China-North Korean relations”.
However, given that Mr Xi’s visit would “boost Kim’s standing in both domestic and international contexts”, it was also possible the visit had been planned “purely for bilateral considerations”, Mr Zhang said.
South Korea’s presidential Blue House said on Monday it had been in close consultation with Beijing over the meeting and added that Mr Xi’s visit would contribute to the resumption of talks over denuclearisation.
Top South Korean officials will meet US counterparts in Washington this week to assess options for resuming negotiations with North Korea.
Hu Jintao was the last Chinese leader to visit North Korea, in 2005.
He hugged Kim Jong Il, the then North Korean leader, on the tarmac as he was leaving.
Mr Xi travelled to North Korea in 2008 when he was vice-president.
This year also marks the 70th anniversary of formal diplomatic ties between North Korea and China.

Mohamed Morsi, the former Islamist Egyptian president who was ousted by the military in 2013, has died in court, according to state media.
State television said Mr Morsi fainted after a court session and died afterwards.
A leader of the Muslim Brotherhood group, Mr Morsi was elected president in 2012 in the country’s first-ever free presidential election.
He was removed a year later by a popularly-backed coup led by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the current president who then served as defence minister.
Mr Morsi is understood to have suffered from diabetes.
He has been in prison since his ouster and has stood trial in several cases, including one in which he was charged with espionage.

US president Donald Trump has accused Mario Draghi of “unfairly” manipulating the euro, after the European Central Bank president made dovish comments that sent government bond prices sharply higher and pushed down the single currency.
Speaking at the ECB’s annual symposium in Sintra, Portugal, Mr Draghi said the bank could launch a fresh expansion of its €2.6tn quantitative easing programme if the inflation outlook failed to improve.
The euro sank about 0.5 per cent against the dollar, reaching a low of just under $1.12, while European and US equities rose — Germany’s Dax index was up 2 per cent on the day and the S&P 500 was more than 1 per cent higher in afternoon trading.
Mr Trump hit out at Mr Draghi’s remarks, suggesting that Europe was engaging in currency manipulation. “Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come, which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar, making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA,” the US president wrote on Twitter. “They have been getting away with this for years, along with China and others.”
He also commented on the rise in European share prices, tweeting: “German DAX way up due to stimulus remarks from Mario Draghi. Very unfair to the United States!”
Mr Draghi struck back, saying that the ECB was simply fulfilling its mandate.
“We have our remit, we have our mandate . . . defined as [targeting] a rate of inflation close but below 2 per cent over the medium term,” he said. “We are ready to use all the instruments that are necessary to fulfil this mandate and we can’t target the exchange rate.”
The row came as the US Federal Reserve prepared to discuss whether to cut interest rates in response to signs that the global trade war was hitting growth.
Officials are due to announce their decision in Washington on Wednesday.
Mr Trump has expressed a clear preference for a cut, saying last week that the central bank was “very disruptive to us”.
His remarks on Tuesday prompted a stinging rebuke from Stan Fischer, former vice-chair of the US Federal Reserve, who said the Fed “should not be subject to orders from the president of the United States”.
Predicting that if he was re-elected Mr Trump might pick a Fed chair who was more sympathetic to his views, Mr Fischer said that could produce a “very different monetary policy” and suggested the question of whether the US was becoming “a Third World country” was something that had to be given “a positive probability”.
It is not the first time Mr Trump and his administration have expressed concern about weakness in the euro.
Early in his tenure, top White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Germany used the euro to “exploit” the US.
Last month, the US Treasury said that Germany, Ireland and Italy, all euro members, “merit close attention to their currency practices”.
Separately on Tuesday, the Trump administration’s top trade representative Robert Lighthizer criticised the EU for failing to match the US’s ambition for a “level playing field” in international trade.
Mr Lighthizer argued that the EU’s tariff and non-tariff barriers harmed US exporters, particularly in agriculture, in remarks likely to fuel European concerns that Mr Trump will take a more aggressive posture towards Brussels once the US dispute with China is resolved.
As investors anticipated a fresh round of ECB bond-buying, European government bond yields fell sharply; French 10-year bond yields turned negative for the first time, falling 0.1 percentage points.
German government bonds hit a new record, with 10-year yields sinking 0.07 percentage points on the day to minus 0.32 per cent, while 10-year yields in Sweden, which is not a euro member, fell 0.027 percentage points, also falling past 0 per cent for the first time.
Italian government bonds rallied to their lowest level since last year’s politically driven sell-off, with the 10-year yield down 0.17 percentage points to 2.112 per cent.

Boris Johnson has one foot in 10 Downing Street.
One week into the race to succeed Theresa May as Britain’s prime minister, the most charismatic, shambolic and divisive politician of his generation is sweeping the field, his route to power now clearly defined.
“We have a long way to go,” Mr Johnson said after securing a decisive victory in the first round of voting for the Conservative party leadership, winning the backing of 114 Tory MPs — more than the next three challengers combined. But he is now propelled by a momentum that threatens to crush his rivals.
Even George Osborne, the former chancellor and longtime political foe of Mr Johnson, can see the writing on the wall.
Mr Osborne, editor of the London Evening Standard, splashed his front page this week with the headline: “Bojo: I’ve got mojo to unite Britain.”
That is a contentious claim.
While Mr Johnson may possess political stardust, he seems an unlikely healer of a fractured country.
The former London mayor led the 2016 referendum campaign to take Britain out of the EU and — if he becomes prime minister — will take on the task of delivering the Leave vote that split the nation.
Polls show he is both the most popular and least liked prospective Tory premier.
Rivals question his “seriousness” at a momentous time for the country.
Donald Tusk, European Council president, says “ a special place in hell” awaits Mr Johnson and his fellow Brexiters.
“I think he’s probably going to win,” says Dominic Grieve, the pro-European former Conservative attorney-general. “That will have potentially dire consequences for the party and the country.” Rory Stewart, a rival for the leadership, said this week: “Is this the person you want writing the instructions to the nuclear submarines?”
Supporters of 54-year-old Mr Johnson privately admit that the only person who can halt his bid for power is the candidate himself.
The Eton and Oxford-educated journalist is his own worst enemy, as his abortive bid for the Tory leadership in 2016 demonstrated.
Mr Johnson’s campaign team have tried to save him from himself. “Bozzie Bear”, as his new partner Carrie Symonds calls him, has been shackled and muzzled, held back from broadcast interviews and television debates so far because of fears the frontrunner has little to gain and much to lose from such exposure. （On Friday, Mr Johnson agreed to take part in a BBC debate next week, though he will not participate in Channel 4’s hustings on Sunday.）
Mr Johnson split last year from his wife Marina, his new relationship adding yet more tabloid colour to a career which has seen him sacked twice for lying: once as a journalist on The Times for making up a quote, and once as a Tory spokesman after misleading his party leader about an extramarital affair.
The 2019 version of Mr Johnson is very different to the 2016 version.
Ms Symonds, a 31-year-old former Tory staffer, has put him on a diet, imposed order on his distinctive blond hair and kept a tight grip on his circle of advisers.
“She knows who the sane people are,” says one close colleague.
At this week’s campaign launch Ms Symonds sat at the back of the hall as Mr Johnson went through his safety-first script, which focused on his two terms as London mayor （2008-16） while skirting over his unimpressive stint as foreign secretary.
He resigned from the cabinet last year in protest at Mrs May’s “crazy” Brexit plan, before eventually backing it in a House of Commons vote.
“As foreign secretary he scored high on energy and profile, but less well on diplomatic skills, detailed concentration on the brief or lasting policy achievements,” says Simon Fraser, a former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office.
Alan Duncan, a minister who served under Mr Johnson, says of his former boss: “Clearing up after him was quite a full-time activity.”
It is hard to discern how Mr Johnson intends to break the current Brexit impasse, although he insists that EU leaders will cut him a better deal in the autumn simply to get the issue resolved.
If necessary he will take Britain out of the EU without a deal “as a last resort”.
The Mr Johnson vying to be prime minister is also very different from the unkempt Tory candidate who stood for London mayor in 2008, the eccentric who captured a Labour city by showing that a Conservative could be socially liberal and enthusiastic about a modern, cosmopolitan Britain.
As Mr Osborne noted in an editorial this week, the Mr Johnson who called for an immigration amnesty as London mayor then led an EU referendum campaign “that fuelled hostility to foreigners and stoked anger about modernity and social change”.
Which Boris would become prime minister?
Mr Johnson’s answer throughout has been: “Which Boris do you want me to be?” In private meetings with Tory MPs, he is both a hard Brexiter comfortable with a no-deal exit and a compassionate Conservative eager to engineer the softest possible departure from the EU.
Like his friend Donald Trump, Mr Johnson is capable of holding contradictory positions simultaneously.
Keith Simpson, a veteran Tory MP, says: “The thing about Boris is that he will always let you down.”
But many Conservatives will back Mr Johnson simply because he looks like a winner.
For a traumatised party, he appears to be the only candidate capable of changing the political weather.
Nobody can be sure which Boris they will get.
But they do know they will be in for an interesting ride.

A legal battle between a Beijing-based conglomerate and one of China’s most prestigious universities is threatening Credit Suisse’s plans to take majority control of a securities brokerage connected to the dispute.
Peking University has launched a lawsuit against shareholders in Founder Group, alleging that its sale of 65 per cent of the company to three investors 15 years ago was invalid due to fraud and the use of state money to make the purchase.
The suit seeks to bring the shares held by the trio — Li You, Wei Xin and Yu Li — back under Peking University’s control.
The case has highlighted how legal troubles still haunt the privatisation of state assets carried out more than a decade ago, often under the banner of economic reform.
It has also led to concerns over the status of foreign investors that have since bought into those now-private assets.
The dispute, which was received by Beijing No 1 Intermediate People’s Court, has raised questions over whether the fight for control over Founder will impede Credit Suisse’s plans to become a majority shareholder in a domestic securities house it owns with Founder Securities.
The Swiss bank holds 33.3 per cent of Credit Suisse Founder Securities and said in April that it reached an agreement with Founder Securities to buy up to 51 per cent in the business.
Corporate records show that Founder Securities is majority held by Peking University but also includes large shareholdings by the three executives targeted in the lawsuit.
Since the Chinese authorities lifted the cap on foreign ownership of securities trading and fund management companies from 49 per cent to 51 per cent last year, many of the world’s biggest banks have been pushing to take full control of their operations in China. The move is particularly important for Credit Suisse, which has made expansion in Asia a key strategy under its chief executive Tidjane Thiam.
Credit Suisse would not answer questions regarding the impact of the lawsuit on its business in China or how it would affect the deal for CS Founder Securities.
A Founder Group spokesperson would also not comment on the deal with Credit Suisse.
On questions regarding the allegations that Founder shares were improperly transferred 15 years ago, the spokesperson said: “Any illegal or criminal act shall be corrected as soon as possible in accordance with the law.”
Mr Li, Mr Wei and Ms Yu could not be reached for comment.
The allegations are contested.
Earlier this year Ms Yu told Economic Observer that she disagreed with Peking University’s depiction of how the original deal took place.
The case was first reported by respected Chinese newspaper Economic Observer and was confirmed by Founder.
The potential to roll back a state privatisation that happened a decade and a half ago has led finance experts in the country to question how many other such cases could arise.
“One of the reasons this case has attracted so much attention was the prolonged duration since the incident,” said Shen Meng, director at Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank in Beijing. “It has been a very long time since Founder’s mixed ownership and restructuring.”
Founder was started by Peking University in 1986 as a university-controlled computer technologies developer.
A 65 per cent stake in the company was sold to the three Founder executives in 2004, a move considered a big privatisation of a state asset.
Since then it has grown into a conglomerate with businesses ranging from internet technology and real estate to healthcare and finance.
In 2016, Mr Li was convicted of insider trading, according to Chinese media reports.
But the executives still hold large shares in the company, corporate records show.
The lawsuit alleges that the sale of shares in Founder in 2004 to the three businesspeople was paid for with Founder money, indicating a pilfering of state assets, according to Economic Observer.
It also alleges that fraudulent financial documents were used in the transaction.

Alibaba has unveiled a major shake-up of top executives and business units as the Chinese tech giant prepares to launch a secondary listing in Hong Kong.
Maggie Wu, chief financial officer, will now oversee strategic investments, a key area for the group which has its roots in ecommerce, but also boasts a portfolio of more than 100 investments. She will work alongside vice chairman, Joe Tsai, who now has responsibility for M&A, in a move that will bring investee companies more tightly into the ecosystem, Alibaba said in an internal memo on Tuesday.
As part of the restructuring Freshippo, the fresh groceries business known as Hema in Chinese, will be hived off into a stand-alone business. Freshippo is a marquee business for Alibaba and the apogee of its new retail model, which fuses online orders and delivery with bricks and mortar stores. The move leaves it ripe for a separate listing.
Alibaba is also reviving its innovation initiatives unit, which will carve out some of the businesses now under digital media and entertainment – including literature and music.
It will bring it together with Tmall Genie, in a move to better integrate content with its smart speaker.

In an age of fast-changing and sometimes uncertain trends in business education, financial training is proving extremely resilient.
Global demand for masters in finance （MiF） degree courses increased slightly in 2018, although the picture differed between regions.
Applications were up at most European schools running the programmes, thanks to an increase in international applications, while those to US institutions were down due to declining international interest, mirroring trends for MBAs.
Unlike the MBA market, however — where even highly ranked schools such as Iowa’s Tippie College of Business have stopped courses because of falling demand — no one in business education is questioning whether the MiF degree has a future. This is due to factors including clear career paths for graduates. Another boost comes from schools adapting MiF courses to attract more diverse students in terms of age, gender and the subjects they have studied in the past.
The MiF is a specialist degree, focused on the financial services market, which is both willing and able to hire formally trained talent.
“The return on investment is much clearer than for other specialist masters degrees,” says David Asch, director of quality services at the European Foundation for Management Development, an accreditation body.
The median starting salary for MiF graduates in the US this year is $85,000, compared with $80,000 for a masters in management graduate and $75,000 for a master of accounting, according to the Graduate Management Admission Council （GMAC） that administers business school entry tests.
Some schools are developing shorter versions of their full-time degrees for people working in finance who want to update their skills, says Tim Mescon, executive vice-president and chief officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at accreditation body AACSB.
“They are taking what was this intensive two-year experience and repackaging it as certificate programmes,” he says.
These top-up courses help professionals to learn about new trends affecting their work.
Such flexible approaches are part of an evolution in business education as a whole, catering to people who dip into training as working lives lengthen and technologies, including digitisation and blockchain, transform their roles, says Mr Mescon.
“We talk about learners not students,” he says, adding that some people opt for “university experiences” through full- or part-time MiF courses, while others take non-degree certificate programmes while working.
Top-up courses in finance are also proving popular among students who are already studying for a masters that is less specialised than the MiF.
The University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School, for example, launched an asset management masterclass in 2017 for students completing MBAs and masters degrees in financial economics or law and finance.
The aim is to help them break into investment banking, private equity and asset management.
The course has been oversubscribed, with two applicants for every place.
The school also started an elective programme on big data for 40 students on the graduate finance degree.
Demand was so strong that a second course on the topic has been added.
These courses were not only a response to student demand — potential employers were also eager for the school to train executives that they could hire, according to Ken Okamura, programme director for the masters in financial economics degree at Saïd.
“The market [for this qualification] is clearly expanding,” he says. “The biggest challenge [for business schools] is continuing to be relevant.”
Despite a sense that MiF students prefer shorter courses, MIT Sloan School of Management has gone in the other direction: in 2015 it added an 18-month option to its core 12-month programme.
“This allows students an extra term to take additional courses and gain additional practical experience with a summer internship,” says Heidi Pickett, assistant dean for the degree course.
The intake for the longer course was initially capped at 30 students, but this has been raised to 50 due to demand, which is stronger than for the 12-month degree, according to Ms Pickett.
“I can see us increasing the 18-month cohort in the coming years,” she adds.
Imperial College Business School uses its parent university’s reputation as a centre of excellence in climate change research and technology — as well as engineering and mathematics — to stay competitive.
This helps it attract a diverse pool of MiF students, according to Lara Cathcart, finance professor and academic director of the programme.
Students can take electives in climate change and coding, gaining access to speakers from around the world who are beamed into lectures as holograms.
“We are applying the strengths that we have,” Prof Cathcart says, adding that word-of-mouth recommendations are the best way to attract applicants.
Imperial’s approach is proving popular.
Applications are up 15 per cent year-on-year across its five full-time MiF degree courses.
The school is attracting diverse students: 42 per cent of this year’s cohorts are women, up from 35 per cent last year.
This is a gender balance most graduate business degrees can only aspire to （the full-time MBA at Imperial is 39 per cent female）.
MiF courses in the US and Europe have long been able to boast greater diversity than other business masters programmes, largely because they attract female students from China.
Careers in asset management and banking in Europe and the US are deemed to offer a better work-life balance than other business sectors.
MIT Sloan School of Management is working hard to attract diverse students.
Only 14 per cent of the school’s July intake for the MiF course are US citizens compared with 62 per cent of the MBA class graduating next summer.
One way the school has maintained international demand was to ensure the course was STEM （science, technology, engineering and mathematics） classified.
This means overseas graduates can work in the US for three years after graduation, instead of the usual one.
The focus for many schools in Europe and the US is to diversify further by attracting students who do not have a background or education in finance.
Mr Mescon notes that MiF courses already attract engineering graduates and those with a computer science background who want a career change.
Investment banks in particular say they would like more people with humanities degrees, says Mr Okamura.
The problem, he believes, is finding people with these degrees who also have a good grasp of maths.
Saïd is considering offering online maths courses to help prospective students improve their skills, he adds, but it is hard to find the right course to fit individual needs.
There are alternatives to a full-time MiF, most notably the globally recognised Chartered Financial Analyst （CFA） credential. This is both more flexible （the level one exam can be taken in either June or December） and cheaper （the CFA Institute puts the typical cost of its qualification at $6,500 — compared with the £46,800 （$59,482） charged by London Business School for its MiF, for example）.
Applicants to the CFA programme have grown 18 per cent over the past three years, driven by rising demand in Asia.
More than 250,000 students are due to sit the exam this June, all hoping to advance their careers.
“We are lucky in that we are relatively speaking a very cheap product but still recognised as very beneficial to your career,” says Paul Smith, president and chief executive of the CFA Institute.
The challenge is for business schools to provide more flexible, and cheaper, alternatives to campus-based teaching.
Just as we have seen more MBAs offered as online-only courses, look out for the rise of the digital MiF degree.

Huawei’s founder on Monday cut the company’s revenue forecast for 2019 by a sixth and said it would scale back production, as the Chinese telecoms maker grapples with the fallout of the US government’s move to cutting off critical suppliers.
"Over the next two years, the company will reduce production. We estimate we’ll reduce production by $30bn,” said Ren Zhengfei, founder and president of Huawei, speaking at a panel discussion on technology, markets and enterprise in Shenzhen.
“This [calendar] year and next year, our revenues will be around $100bn.”
The new estimates imply that revenue, previously forecast to increase from Rmb721.2bn （$104.2bn） in 2018 to $120bn, would now be broadly flat through 2020, representing a significant downgrade to the company’s growth prospects.
He added that Huawei would “become stronger” after the company had “walked this path”.
Huawei has been thrown into turmoil after US President Donald Trump in May placed it on a prohibitive “ entity list” that bans American companies from selling technology to the Chinese telecoms maker.
His administration has also moved to bar US carriers from using Huawei equipment for next-generation 5G networks on national security grounds, and has pressed allies to do the same.
Huawei has said the blacklisting would hit around 1,200 of its US suppliers, including companies that provide the majority of the backbone of the company’s cyber security system.
Mr Ren expressed surprise at the forcefulness of the US restrictions, saying “we didn’t think that the US would attack Huawei with such great strategy and determination...not only attacking our suppliers, we also can’t take part in many international organisations, we can’t increase our cooperation with universities, we can’t use anything with US content”.
However, he insisted that “these things can’t halt our onward march”.

Protests in Hong Kong over a botched extradition bill swelled into the biggest demonstrations seen in the territory in decades on Sunday, despite a government climbdown over the proposed law and a rare apology from its leader.
The protesters demanded the resignation of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, and the full withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill.
The legislation would for the first time allow criminal suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to face trial in mainland China.
The outpouring of public anger, which started eight days earlier when hundreds of thousands took to the streets, forced Ms Lam on Saturday to announce she would suspend the bill, representing a huge retreat for a government that for months has insisted that nothing would stop the passage of the legislation.
Her office issued an apology on Sunday, and said the government “reiterated that there is no timetable for restarting the [legislative] process”.
Organisers estimated that 2m people marched in Sunday’s protest, while police put the number at 338,000.
“We don’t accept [Ms Lam’s apology]. In her statement, she only softened her tone, but did not respond to people’s demands,” said Jimmy Sham, convener of Civil Human Rights Front, which organised Sunday’s march.
He vowed to continue with more protests if the government did not meet the protesters demands.
The demonstrations increase the pressure on Ms Lam and her political overlords in Beijing to defuse one of the worst political crises in the territory since its handover from Britain to China 22 years ago.
“The main psychology [today] is that last week’s demonstration of people power worked,” said Willy Lam, a China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, speaking from Sunday’s protest.
Hong Kong’s government has argued the extradition bill is needed to prevent the city from becoming a haven for criminals.
But critics counter it could be misused by Beijing to gain custody of political opponents or others living in or passing through the territory.
Foreign governments including the US and the UK have opposed the bill as a threat to Hong Kong’s high level of autonomy, guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula agreed by Britain and China prior to the handover.
On Sunday, the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said President Donald Trump would raise the matter with China’s President Xi Jinping at a potential meeting between the two leaders at the G20 summit in Japan this month.
“Ultimately we just don’t trust the legal system in China,” said Alice Wong, a computer science student who marched on Sunday. “The so-called safeguards against political charges [implemented by the Hong Kong government in the extradition bill] aren’t enough.”
At 9.30pm on Sunday night, seven hours after the demonstration began, enormous black-clad crowds were still streaming past the Hong Kong police headquarters heading towards the Legislative Council, the territory’s de facto parliament, which has been the focal point of the protests.
As the peaceful crowd passed the police station, many chanted abuse and made obscene gestures, calling on the police to apologise for their allegedly heavy-handed tactics during a protest on Wednesday that turned violent.
At least 94 people including 22 police were injured and 11 arrested in that protest, which brought Asia’s premier international financial centre to a standstill and shocked a city unaccustomed to violent political unrest.
Beijing, which controls the appointment of Hong Kong’s chief executive, the title given to the city’s leader, has backed the extradition bill while in recent days also distancing itself, saying it was Ms Lam’s initiative.
Official Chinese media have characterised the protests as being driven by foreign forces.
A People’s Daily’s opinion piece said the protesters were acting as “foot soldiers” for foreign powers.
In stark contrast to Wednesday, police were largely absent along the march route on Sunday and those on the street were dressed in their standard uniforms rather than riot gear.
Ms Lam has emphasised she has suspended rather than withdrawn the bill, arguing the amendment was well intended but had been poorly communicated to the people of Hong Kong. A senior government official said on Sunday night she would resume public consultations on the bill but it would not return to the legislative agenda this year.
Protesters are also calling on the government to revise their description of Wednesday’s event as a “riot” and release those arrested.
Police commissioner Lo Wai-chung said the police acted in self-defence last Wednesday after protesters, allegedly armed with metal poles and wooden boards, threw bricks at them.
Online posts gave recommendations on what people should carry with them — water, masks and energy bars — and encouraged marchers to bring flowers and paper cranes to mark the spot where a man fell to his death on Saturday while protesting against the bill. Many of the protesters were carrying white flowers in tribute.

The most hotly anticipated debut at this year’s Cannes Lions festival will be TikTok, a Chinese viral video app that is plotting a raid on the advertising dollars flowing to Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube.
The app, which has now been downloaded  more than 1bn times according to third-party estimates, will address advertisers from the main stages, where Stefan Heinrich, its US brand director is speaking, and in a series of invitation-only roundtables.
As it plans its push into the US and Europe, TikTok has made a series of high-profile hires, including Blake Chandlee and Vanessa Pappas, from Facebook and YouTube.
Owned by the $75bn private Chinese company ByteDance, TikTok lets users watch, create and share quick-fire videos, usually set to pop music, of anything from dances to songs to make-up tutorials.
It has become hugely popular with younger users, and is now attracting the attention of brands including Burberry and Pretty Little Thing.
“It’s a platform that has spiked the interest of a lot of advertisers not just because of their scale but also because of the type of volumes they have: Generation Z,” said Simona Marmina, senior director of paid social at WPP’s Mindshare.
“The engagement on the platform is insane,” she said, adding that the company boasted 37bn monthly video views and average daily user time on the app of 46 minutes.
Until now,  TikTok has kept its strategy under wraps, as it focused on building its audience, often advertising on rival platforms such as Snapchat and Instagram.
“TikTok is playing a customer acquisition [game] right now — driving engagement around the product,” said Greg Bettinelli, a partner at LA-based Upfront Ventures.
But the app is now ready to address Cannes with more details about its advertising offer, and has been testing a range of different products, according to several people familiar with its plans.
These include standard vertical video ads typically offered by rivals such as Instagram, ads that splash across the screen before the main content feed loads and branded camera filters, similar to those available on Snapchat.
Another novel advertising format known as a “hashtag challenge”, where advertisers can attempt to start their own viral video campaign, has been generating plenty of interest, according to two people in the industry.
“It is a new digital creative canvas that we can play with that allows for totally new ideas that weren’t possible before . . .[including] new ways to blend in,” said Kris Hoet, global head of innovation at ad agency Foote, Cone & Belding.
In the longer term, the app may introduce features including one-click shopping, which is already built into Douyin, the version of TikTok for the Chinese mainland.
“TikTok only has a subset of the features of its sister app in China,” said Connie Chan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in a blog post. “A larger focus on livestreaming and ecommerce give creators financial incentives to broadcast and create great content through these mechanisms. So, it will be interesting to see how TikTok evolves on the social front.”
TikTok would not confirm details of its ads offering but a spokesperson said that it was “exploring a variety of opportunities for brand partners” and that the most successful brands were embracing “the creativity and authenticity of the TikTok community”.
Meanwhile, the company has been hiring tech and media veterans as it builds its business.
Earlier this year, it brought in Ms Pappas, YouTube’s former global head of creative insights, as its first general manager in the US, while Sameer Singh, former chief executive of South Asia at global media investment firm Group M, was recently tapped for the position of vice-president of monetisation in India.
It also appointed Mr Chandlee, Facebook’s first employee in Europe and its former vice-president of global partnerships, last month to a vice-president role overseeing business strategy in the Americas and Emea.
One hurdle to its expansion is the lack of a platform where advertisers can buy and track ads online, said analysts and advertisers.
Advertisers currently have to seek information from TikTok’s sales team.
“That will definitely be something that opens the door to other opportunities for them,” Ms Marmina said, adding that TikTok has “limited” metrics around the performance of ads.
But the company intends to introduce these “self-serve” tools this year, she added.
Other critics pointed to the youth of TikTok’s user base and whether they will prove a fickle audience. “There’s a lot of challenges in terms of the short nature of the content . . . and very young consumers,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG. “The further you age down, the harder it is to monetise.”
TikTok has also battled with regulators over safety concerns, particularly because of its audience.
The app was banned  temporarily in India, one of its largest markets, in April over allegations that it was “degrading culture and encouraging pornography”.
Earlier in the year, it was also fined a record $5.7m by the US Federal Trade Commission for allegedly illegally collecting personal information from children.
“We’ve started to see them running into issues with content,” said Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at research firm eMarketer. “Part of that is being a newish company and very renegade.”
The company said it has been investing in content moderation, including a mix of local contractors and employees.

China’s Treasury holdings fell to their lowest level in two years in April, heightening concerns about the impact of the Sino-American trade war on the largest foreign creditor to the US government.
The country’s holdings fell $7.5bn to $1.1tn, their lowest level since April 2017.
Investors and analysts have speculated that China may weaponise its large portfolio of US Treasuries, selling down its holdings in an attempt to tamper with US interest rates, driving them higher.
But such a drastic course of action is still seen as an unlikely outcome; not only would it also harm the value of China’s holdings, but there are few other markets perceived to be large enough to absorb the country’s sizeable investments.
The fresh selling activity came before the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington intensified in May.
Except for a small net purchase in February, China has now sold Treasuries every month since September 2018.

Boeing’s chief executive has vowed there will not be another accident related to the flight control software that has been implicated in two deadly crashes of its 737 Max aircraft, while admitting its communications were unsatisfactory during the crisis.
Addressing the media on the eve of the Paris Air Show and for only the second time since the second crash of the 737 Max in March, Dennis Muilenburg said he was “very confident there will not be another [MCAS-related] accident”. He was referring to the faulty manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system that played a role in both crashes.
Boeing has thrown its weight behind resolving the crisis, said Mr Muilenburg, stressing that the “accidents continue to weigh heavily on us”. They were “something we will never forget,” he said. Boeing, he added, had work to do “to re-earn the public’s trust”.
The company continues to work on a software fix for MCAS but Mr Muilenburg did not give a timetable as to when the Max would return to the skies.
“We are making good steady progress,” he said.
Global aviation safety regulators, he said, were “converging together to certify and get the Max back up in the air. We will take the time necessary to ensure that safety is paramount.”
The company has initiated training and education updates around the world.
Pilots at more than 90 per cent of Max customers have now flown the Max in a simulator setting.
Boeing is also working hard on improving its communications which Mr Muilenburg admitted was an area where “we could have and should have done better”.

Iran said it would soon exceed limits on its enriched uranium stockpile agreed in a nuclear deal with world powers, increasing the urgency of European efforts to save the landmark accord.
The breach, which Tehran said would happen within 10 days, threatens to push the 2015 agreement to total collapse following US President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the pact last year.
It will also stoke already elevated tensions between the Islamic republic and Washington.
The White House responded to Iran’s announcement on Monday by accusing it of engaging in “nuclear blackmail”.
The Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran said the country’s production of uranium enriched to a low level had increased fourfold and its stockpile would pass a 300kg limit by June 27.
Iran could also increase its enrichment of uranium above a purity of 3.67 per cent, the level agreed under the accord, the agency added.
Increasing enrichment to 20 per cent would be a highly provocative move because it would bring Iran much closer to being able to produce weapons-grade uranium, which requires 90 per cent purity.
The Iranian announcement increases the pressure on the accord’s other signatories — Germany, France, UK, Russia and China — to find ways to counter the impact of crippling US sanctions that Mr Trump reimposed after abandoning the deal.
In May, Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, set a 60-day deadline for the signatories to deliver tangible measures to enable Iran to export oil and transact with international banks.
The deadline is July 7.
Washington has been stepping up its pressure on Tehran in recent weeks. Mr Trump accused Tehran of being behind  attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week and US officials have said they suspect Iran was involved in sabotage attacks on four tankers last month.
The US has provided very little evidence for the series of allegations.
The Pentagon last week released a video showing what it said were members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp retrieving an unexploded magnetic mine from the hull of one of the tankers hours after the attacks.
But analysts have said the video does not prove Iran was behind the attacks.
One senior US official said the administration had a range of intelligence but that the video in itself was “pretty conclusive” that Iran was responsible.
Iran has rejected the allegations.
Iran has not previously breached the nuclear accord, but last month Tehran warned that it would increase its atomic activity as the economy reels from the impact of US sanctions.
While some critics blame Mr Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal for inflaming tensions in the Persian Gulf, the White House laid the blame on the Obama administration and the 2015 deal.
“Iran’s enrichment plans are only possible because the horrible nuclear deal left their capabilities intact,” said Garrett Marquis, spokesman for the White House National Security Council.
“President Trump has made it clear that he will never allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons. The regime’s nuclear blackmail must be met with increased international pressure.”
Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation said the remaining signatories to the deal still had time to save the accord, but added that the “current conditions cannot continue”.
It added that Europe “was killing time or wants to do something but cannot practically do” anything to save the deal.
“We have quadrupled production of uranium. The countdown has begun as of today and Iran will surpass the ceiling of 300kg within the next 10 days on June 27,” the organisation said.
If Iran is deemed to be in breach, it would raise the risk of EU and UN sanctions being reimposed on the country.
Under the terms of the agreement, Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear activity in return for the economic benefit of having many sanctions lifted.
But the reimposition of US sanctions has stymied Iran’s ability to export oil and pushed the economy back into a deep recession.

When Rick Deckard, the hero of the 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, gazes down at a futuristic Los Angeles from a flying police car, a Pan Am sign shines on one of the towers.
It is a nod to the helicopter service from the old Pan Am airline building in Manhattan to John F Kennedy airport, which closed down in 1977 after a fatal accident.
Urban mobility is going back to the future. An executive of Uber, which wants to operate flying taxis by 2023, this week promised that the “ever elusive flying car” is almost here. He was speaking at a conference for its Elevate division, where details of its new 30-minute Uber Copter service from Manhattan to JFK were announced.
Uber has selected Dallas, Los Angeles and Melbourne in Australia as pilot cities for its Uber Air taxi service, while Lilium, a Munich-based start-up that is building an electric aircraft with 36 engines, plans to hire hundreds of software engineers in London.
Advances in engines and batteries are making Deckard’s short aerial journey possible; the question is whether it is desirable.
I doubt it.
The trouble with electric aircraft is that the ones that would be undeniably useful — long-range airliners that would reduce the industry’s carbon emissions — are still a distant prospect.
Arriving sooner are short-hop taxis that will ferry a few people across a city, adding noise in the skies to the congestion on the roads.
There is something about flying that provokes investor excitement, but often ends in disappointment.
The vision of on-demand flights on “very light jets”, or VLJs, led to start-ups such as DayJet and Pogo placing big orders for aircraft including the Eclipse 500 in the mid-2000s, then to bankruptcies.
The economics of airlines mean that aircraft need to be in constant use, flying back and forth.
The consultancy Roland Berger estimates that 100,000 “passenger drones” could be in operation by 2050 and Morgan Stanley’s bull case is that the lack of congestion in the skies means that a flying taxi could make 40 commuter trips of 20 miles each in an eight-hour shift.
Better public transport would obviate the need for urban private aviation — helicopters skip from Manhattan to JFK because there is no high-speed rail service to the airport, as in other cities.
People pile into private cars and Ubers, causing gridlock along the Long Island Expressway and creating demand for a $200 Uber Copter trip rather than a $50 ride in a yellow cab.
High-speed rail is a vain aspiration in many US cities because it is impossible to find public investment running into billions.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric-car company Tesla, wants to bore his own tunnels instead, including a pair from Chicago to O’Hare International airport.
It is quixotic but he is right that rail is more civically and ecologically rational than flying taxis.
Safety is another concern.
Private helicopters have a worse accident record than cars, and the helicopter crash in Manhattan on Monday was the second fatal accident within a month.
As Robert Thomson, a partner at Roland Berger, puts it: “The safety case for flying taxis buzzing around tall buildings in all weathers is difficult.”
Electric-aircraft makers such as Lilium insist they are safer than helicopters because they have more engines and rotors, and are less vulnerable to a single point of failure.
But technology will have to advance a long way before autonomous flying taxi fleets, which is Uber’s ultimate aim, are safe.
Meanwhile, there is the everyday problem of noise.
Deckard’s flying car lifts into the air with a mellifluous whine but no one who lives near a helicopter pad would be convinced by that.
Even the noise of a small drone overhead can be intrusive and an air taxi with several people on board will need powerful thrust to ascend vertically.
Uber’s ambition is for the flying taxis it plans to operate, which will be made by companies such as Boeing and Bell Helicopter, to be only half as loud as a medium-sized truck passing a house at 50 feet.
Given that Uber alone also envisages hundreds of flights a day in some cities, the combined effect could sound like a motorway in the sky.
Technology companies that make losses often respond by inventing a new financial metric and, sure enough, Uber’s 2016 white paper on urban air mobility “explored a more nuanced and complete definition of noise than simply sound pressure”.
Arguing with investors is one thing, but trying to redefine noise to residents under its flight path will be a tough sell.
Medium-range electric jets that produce less noise and emissions than traditional jets have potential.
Lilium wants to operate services of up to 300km between towns and cities and Zunum Aero, which is backed by Boeing, is building a hybrid electric regional jet in the US.
When rail links are un­economic, rapid transport on an electric aircraft is an appealing idea.
But cities would be better off putting more people on trains than unleashing squadrons of private taxis in the sky.
Regulators and investors will determine whether services such as Uber Air merit approval and are worth the financial risk.
Both should pause before turning science fiction into fact.

The renminbi exchange rate has a new symbolic number for traders to obsess over.
For nearly a decade before 2005, the figure implanted in investors’ minds was 8.28, the level at which Beijing targeted its currency against the dollar.
Pleas, enticements and threats from the US to let it rise were finally rewarded in 2005 when China let the currency appreciate.
After repegging it during the financial crisis in 2008-10 Beijing has since broadly followed a policy of managing the currency’s movements to prevent instability.
Recently, the renminbi has been hovering around a symbolic level of 7 to the dollar — round numbers often enjoy undue attention in the foreign exchange markets — and threatening to fall through it.
That would mark the currency’s weakest point since 2008.
Official US protests against Chinese manipulation have risen in volume again under Donald Trump’s administration.
These days, though, they make little sense.
During the 2000s, the vast piles of foreign exchange reserves China was building up by selling renminbi for dollars, alongside a large and persistent current account surplus, suggested US complaints about manipulation were justified.
But it is hard to look at the recent fall and conclude this is somehow deliberate manipulation for export-promotion reasons.
China’s recent intervention — as often over the past few years — has generally been to keep the renminbi up, not hold it down.
Following an unexpectedly sharp depreciation in 2015 after the central bank allowed the exchange rate more room to move, China resorted to capital controls to prevent the currency collapsing.
In fact, it would seem quite logical for the renminbi to come under downward pressure at the moment.
It is an obvious response by a country’s currency when tariffs are imposed against its exports: regaining through the exchange rate competitiveness what it has lost through higher prices in its export markets.
Mr Trump seems to believe China is deliberately manipulating its exchange rate downwards.
This is a distortion of reality.
When G20 finance ministers met last weekend, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, came up with some highly contrived reasoning.
“Sometimes if the market expects intervention and you’ve been intervening for a long time to support a currency, and you don’t intervene, that could also have a big market impact,” he said.
Coming from the US Treasury — normally the adult in the room when it comes to exchange rate policy — such arguments are particularly worrying.
Hotheads tend to reside elsewhere in the administration.
Counterweights are desperately needed to restrain Mr Trump from taking more extreme action such as imposing currency-related tariffs on top of the duties already introduced, or even direct intervention in the foreign exchange markets to weaken the dollar.
For China to target a particular exchange rate — in particular, fetishising the level of 7 to the dollar — is ill-advised.
But for a country with an incomplete financial system including capital controls, foreign exchange intervention is an inevitable part of its armoury.
In reality, Mr Trump is fighting a battle against mercantilist Chinese currency manipulation the justification for which ended several years ago.
The US has more of a point when it opposes the extensive trade-distorting interventions by the government in China’s economy.
But to ignore the fact Beijing has been intervening to steady and hold up its currency only serves as an excuse for the White House to open a new front in the nascent cold war with China, now its strategic competitor.

Who should succeed Mario Draghi as president of the European Central Bank? That is the most important decision European governments will take this year. It is more important even than how they deal with an idiotic UK. It is more important than dealing with Donald Trump. It is more important than who will be presidents of the commission or council. The next president of the ECB might determine whether there is a eurozone, perhaps an EU, at the end of the term in 2027. Mr Draghi’s period has been that important. His successor’s might be equally so.
In October 2011, I wrote an open letter to Mr Draghi.
I argued the ECB must be a lender of last resort in markets for public debt, thereby also stabilising the banks.
I concluded that the “eurozone risks a tidal wave of fiscal and banking crises. The European Financial Stability Facility cannot stop this. Only the ECB can. As the sole eurozone-wide institution, it has the responsibility. It also has the power. I am sorry, Mario. But you face a choice between pleasing the monetary hawks and saving the eurozone. Choose the latter. Explain why you are making the choice. And remember: fortune favours the bold.”
Mr Draghi did the right things, above all with his celebrated remark in July 2012 that “within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro”.
In August 2012, the ECB announced its Outright Monetary Transactions programme, to buy the bonds of distressed governments who agreed suitable programmes.
Then, in January 2015, the ECB followed other central banks, by starting quantitative easing.
By reasonable standards, inflation has failed to reach the ECB objective of “below, but close to 2 per cent”. But in other respects, the ECB’s actions were a success. The death spiral of soaring bond yields and enfeebled banks halted. The eurozone economy troughed in 2013 and then largely tracked that of the US, as yields normalised and confidence dripped back. （See charts.）
The recovery of the eurozone from its crisis, perhaps even its survival, owes more to the ECB than any other institution.
This is not to deny the role of governments in setting up new institutions and, when push came to shove, backing the ECB.
But this was the one eurozone-wide institution with the needed firepower.
This will remain true in the future, given the enduring fragility of a eurozone characterised by national — rather than area-wide — politics, weak banks, inadequate fiscal backstops, and persistently divergent economies.
Mr Draghi has transformed the ECB from a descendant of the old Bundesbank into a modern central bank, and from a central bank thinking for a small open economy to one appropriate to a diverse and continental-scale economy.
The crucial question then is whether his successor will possess the intellect, flexibility and courage needed to respond to whatever happens.
Some of what might happen could indeed be perilous: the world is highly unstable; eurozone inflation is very low; and monetary policy is close to its normal limits.
Even today’s slowdown demands action.
A worse slowdown might demand heroic action.
The next president might have to pull new rabbits out of the hat.
It is doubtful whether any of the candidates meet these high standards.
The riskiest by far would be Jens Weidmann, Bundesbank president.
Mr Weidmann has opposed many of Mr Draghi’s innovations, including resort to QE .
He even testified against OMT before the German constitutional court.
The ECB council might be able to force him to do the right thing, in a crisis.
But that would be a mad way to run the central bank.
Yet there is an alternative possibility.
The one thing that could reconcile Germans to how the ECB must behave is recognition of that reality by a German president.
He would have to tell his compatriots some home truths.
Most obviously, that inflation has been lower under the ECB than under the Bundesbank.
Then he would have to point out that a world of low inflation and generally very low interest rates is not one in which their savings have much economic value.
Finally, such a German president should add that the German private sector has a surplus of savings over investment comparable in scale to that of Japan.
It is possible for Germany to have full employment and a budget surplus because Germany has been running a huge current account surplus.
That would have been far more difficult if Germany had not been inside the eurozone: a floating Deutsche Mark would surely have appreciated hugely, Germany would now be in deflation, much more of its export-oriented production would have moved out and its monetary policy might be like Japan’s.
In brief, Germany has been a huge economic beneficiary of the euro.
A Mr Weidmann who had said that again and again, and had also strongly backed the actions taken by the ECB, could have made a big difference to eurozone politics.
Unfortunately, such a Mr Weidmann has not been in evidence.
Instead, he has represented and so validated the sceptical German view.
If that is what he would do as president, it would be a disaster.
If he took the broader view, it would be a blessing.
This, and not his nationality, is the issue.
There can be no objection to a German president.
On the contrary, a realistic and reasonable German president would be a great boon.
So which would Mr Weidmann be?
Only he knows.
Above all, this decision must not be the product of horse-trading among governments.
The question is whether the next president can and will do the job as Mr Draghi defined it.
Everything else is noise.

The EU is preparing to tackle its cyber security failures in the wake of breaches including a massive leak of diplomatic cables and the suspected hacking of its mission in Moscow.
Bloc leaders are expected to start talks at a summit in Brussels this week aimed at countering problems ranging from eavesdropping to communication breakdowns that meant the Russia incident was little-known internally for weeks, diplomats said.
It highlights growing fears that EU institutions have failed to keep pace with growing threats to information security, especially given the bloc’s extensive vulnerabilities as a network of 28 sovereign states.
One senior diplomat said the emergence this month of the alleged Moscow breach raised “serious questions” about the bloc’s electronic “security culture”.
“In a world where the EU and its member states are under constant attack in cyber space . . . we need to be a bit more savvy and a bit more secure,” the official said.
The EU leaders’ meeting starting on Thursday is expected to call for a tougher approach to protecting the bloc’s information and communication networks, diplomats said.
The proposals are likely to build on plans floated by countries including Latvia and big member states such as France and the UK, diplomats said.
A summary of Riga’s ideas seen by the Financial Times points to how the EU’s efforts to assert itself internationally have triggered other powers to launch “increased intelligence-gathering or even influence operations against EU decision-shaping and decision-making processes”.
Hostile intelligence operations against EU institutions, agencies and delegations worldwide are “becoming more frequent”, the document warns.
It outlines possible countermeasures including improved counter-intelligence and “state of the art secure infrastructure, meeting rooms and means of communication inside and between EU institutions”, according to a summary seen by the FT.
Media reports this month of the suspected breach of the EU mission in Moscow surprised and alarmed some officials in Brussels and national capitals, especially as it emerged the EU’s diplomatic service uncovered the problems in April.
Diplomatic service officials insist it promptly shared information about the incident — which is still under investigation — with relevant cyber security officials in fellow EU institutions and member states.
The disclosure followed news in December of a huge hack of EU diplomatic cables, allegedly by a Chinese group linked to the People’s Liberation Army.
The hackers penetrated the Cypriot foreign ministry and were able to carry out years of cyber espionage before they were detected, according to the US digital security company that exposed the breach.
China has denied any involvement.

One of China’s biggest state-owned companies has shut UBS out of advising on a large bond deal amid widening fallout from remarks about swine fever by one of the Swiss bank’s top economists.
China Railway Construction Corporation has decided not to hire UBS on a dollar-bond sale after comments last week by Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, about pigs in China, according to people familiar with the situation.
UBS had won a mandate on the bond sale of $500m-$1bn by the Chinese group, but was removed as of Monday morning, the people said.
CRCC did not respond to a request for comment, and UBS declined to comment.
Fees for underwriting Chinese debt deals, especially for state-owned enterprises, tend to be lower than comparable deals in other regions.
But the loss of debt capital markets business for the Swiss bank is a new blow to the reputation of its franchise in Asia, following the suspension of its initial public offering sponsorship licence in Hong Kong last year.
Although the bank and Mr Donovan have apologised and removed the comments from UBS’s website, the controversy has grown.
“Chinese consumer prices rose. This was mainly due to sick pigs,” Mr Donovan said last Wednesday in comments about the impact of African swine fever in China. “Does this matter? It matters if you are a Chinese pig. It matters if you like eating pork in China. It does not really matter to the rest of the world.”
Chinese financial group Haitong International Securities said on Friday that it had cut ties between its Hong Kong unit and UBS across all business divisions, based on “a collective decision made by the senior management”.
The Chinese Securities Association of Hong Kong, which represents the brokerage arms of many Chinese banks in Hong Kong, rejected the bank’s response on Thursday and called on UBS to fire Mr Donovan.
The Zurich-based bank put Mr Donovan on leave last week and said it was reviewing the matter to see if more steps needed to be taken.
The row could threaten the foothold UBS has established in China and is looking to expand.
In December, the bank secured clearance from the country’s securities regulator to increase its holdings in Beijing-based UBS Securities from 24.99 per cent to 51 per cent, putting it on track to become the first foreign bank in China to take a controlling stake in its local securities joint venture.
UBS was suspended from sponsoring Hong Kong IPOs for 18 months in March last year after it and Standard Chartered were investigated for their roles in the 2009 IPO of China Forestry. The Chinese company was later delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange for accounting irregularities and put into liquidation.

Laure Lam Hung was born and raised on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius before moving to the UK to study biology at University College London and Cambridge university.
When it came to studying for an MBA, however, Ms Lam Hung chose Singapore Management University.
The choice was partly about career advancement: Singapore is a leading biotech force in Asia.
But Ms Lam Hung was particularly attracted by the gender balance on the SMU course.
On average just 38 per cent of the intake across the top 100 MBA courses in this year’s Financial Times ranking were women, a figure that has barely changed in the past decade.
At SMU the gender split is almost exactly 50:50.
“Being one of many women on the course makes the experience more valuable,” Ms Lam Hung says. Feeling an equal part of the class, she notes, made it easier to speak up during debates and encouraged her to aim higher.
“I have met smart, strong and kind women in my batch from whom I have learnt as much as from the men in my class,” she says.
Gender balance aids the learning experience for all, says Gerry George, dean of the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at SMU.
“More women means that even men listen more,” he says.
Gender diversity subtly changes the dynamic of turn-taking in classroom discussions, Mr George adds.
“It might even improve empathy in engaging with issues, according to some of our faculty who teach negotiation or strategy,” he says.
Tom Robinson, chief executive of AACSB international, the business school accreditation body, notes that as far as diversity is concerned in China’s case, the government has actively sought to create more employment opportunities for women.
As for Singapore, he adds: “I have personally observed that they are very education focused and very progressive. The country is a true meritocracy, where ability and knowledge trump biases.”
Another reason for the higher percentage of women in many Asian business schools could be that the schools are younger than their western counterparts and so have been able to create teaching methods and case studies that are less male focused, says Juan Fernandez, MBA director at Shanghai’s China Europe International Business School.
Here, 40 per cent of the MBA cohort are women.
“While we have not set out to specifically target female students, we do recognise the value of having as much diversity [as possible],” Mr Fernandez says. “We have never had to combat inertia in the campus culture that has leaned towards a male-dominated representation in the student body.”
Ceibs has offered a Women Leadership Scholarship for first-year students since 2012.
But Mr Fernandez stresses that this is just one of several financial incentives designed to increase the diversity of the class, not just by gender but also by ethnicity and background.
“We certainly see an equal balance of interest from both female and male prospects from day one of the recruitment seasons year after year but, to be honest, I believe this trend is catching up across all top-tier programmes, regardless of location.”
Ceibs also has an active Women’s Leadership Network club.
Last year, this group helped organise an Asian Women in Leadership Summit, held in Shanghai.
It was one of the club’s activities to celebrate International Women’s Month, focused on promoting empowerment, career development and societal change for women.
Mr Fernandez notes that neither the WLN nor Ceibs are pushing for the advancement of any one group over another.
“At Ceibs we aim to provide opportunities for both genders to excel,” he says.
China is unusual in that it has a high proportion of female managers compared with other Asian countries.
A survey by recruitment company Hays found that 36 per cent of management roles are held by women in China, compared with an average of 28 per cent elsewhere in Asia.
Bella Lui, who studied accountancy for her undergraduate degree at Toronto’s Rotman University, has since returned to her native China to study for an MBA at Ceibs.
Ms Lui says she appreciates the diversity of voices in the classroom, but is more interested in the spread of backgrounds, nationalities and cultural perspectives among her fellow masters degree students than their gender.
Most of the students on her degree at Rotman were women, she notes.
Similarly, gender diversity was only one factor behind Nurgül Karacan’s decision to leave her family in Switzerland to study for an MBA at SMU.
A 33-year-old Swiss citizen born to Kurdish parents, she found a similar gender balance on the MBA course to that of her undergraduate degree in international management from Zurich University.
The key selling point for her of the 11-month programme was that it enabled her to get back to work more quickly than other MBA programmes, which lasted two years.
Although Ms Karacan had planned to return to Switzerland immediately after graduation, during her internship with an international bank in Singapore she was struck by how more gender balanced the company was than those she had worked for back home.
She aims to spend a few years working full-time in Singapore because she feels it will help her career progress faster than in Switzerland.

Last week, the consulting firm McKinsey released its latest report on the future of work, this time in relation to women.
It described how robots are performing human tasks at an accelerating rate — and dolefully warned that “160m women could lose their current jobs to automation” in the next 12 years.
McKinsey stressed that automation also creates jobs.
But I doubt that point was widely heard.
After all, we live in an age when workers and politicians in the US and Europe are terrified that automation will undermine employment — a fear that may even be contributing to the rise of populism and extremist politics.
But as the hand-wringing about digitisation continues apace, it is worth looking at one country where robots do not seem to inspire quite so much fear: Japan.
Last week, I made a trip to Tokyo and was struck by how much more positive the public debate about automation seems.
Yes, polls show that Japanese workers share some US concerns: a Pew survey last year suggested that 83 per cent of Japanese people think that automation raises inequality.
But they are less concerned that rising automation will make it hard for them to find a job, and an unusually high proportion think that a robot-filled economy would be far more efficient.
Meanwhile, the Japanese media tend to view robots as a source of pride, not terror, since they highlight the country’s ability to innovate; indeed, with 300-plus robots per 10,000 employees, Japan has one of the highest take-ups of robots in the world.
“We like robots!” a Japanese friend explained, with a shrug.
Why?
One reason is that robotics is an industry where Japanese business is ahead of international competitors, creating a sense of national optimism.
Another more subtle factor is that popular culture has tended to present robots as being friendly.
Think of the Astro Boy series, a manga and anime creation that most adult Japanese devoured in their youth: its robotic protagonist presents an appealing face that is easy to embrace.
In Britain, however, today’s adults grew up watching television series such as Doctor Who, which offered a more ambivalent take on robots, with mechanised adversaries such as Daleks and Cybermen that were truly terrifying for young viewers （though aficionados will point out that these beings were technically cyborgs）.
So too in the US, where Hollywood’s robots were at least as likely to harm as to help — to be a relentless Terminator, say, as to be a cute R2-D2.
Then there is a third — more tangible — issue that affects Japanese attitudes towards robots: demography.
Japan’s birth rate is so low （1.43 births per woman） that its working-age population is shrinking at an alarming rate.
Companies have responded by recruiting more women; indeed, one little-noticed detail about modern Japan is that the proportion of women between 15 and 64 who now work is about 68.5 per cent, higher than in the US.
The country has also started to hire a few more workers from places such as China, Vietnam and the Indian subcontinent to fill positions in sectors ranging from elderly care to the development of artificial intelligence （although Japan is a global leader in robotics, it is weak in AI）.
But these measures cannot entirely plug the labour shortage, and there is still considerable hostility towards immigration.
That makes automation seem less terrifying by default.
Then there is a fourth issue: the social safety net.
Last year’s Pew survey revealed that 63 per cent of people in Japan think that it is up to the government — not the individual — to help the population adapt to automation.
Perhaps that’s not so surprising: Japan’s publicly funded social safety net remains pretty robust, and there is still a high（ish） sense of social cohesion, common purpose and sacrifice.
In the US, however, only about 30 per cent of the public expect the government to help with automation, while more than double that number expect the burden to fall on the individual.
That may sound more empowering, but I suspect it is also a recipe for anxiety: some of America’s current problems can be traced to the sense of abandonment felt by many workers in deindustrialised regions.
Maybe our views on robots will change in the coming years.
It will be interesting to see what happens, for example, in places such as Italy, where the birth rate is also falling sharply.
It will be even more interesting to see whether political protest eventually forces the US government to take measures to strengthen the social safety net in the face of automation.
The key point is this: when it comes to robots, Japan may yet have an edge over other nations, not just in terms of its technology but in its attitude too; or, at least, its recognition that robots may yet enable the country to keep growing economically even as its population shrinks.
Call this the unexpected upside of Astro Boy — or maybe a sign that it’s time for Hollywood to embrace robots more wholeheartedly.

The internet is the railroad of our times — an essential piece of public infrastructure over which much of the world’s commerce and communication is now conducted.
Yet the companies that dominate it are private, profit-seeking entities.
And like the rail companies of old, they pose a monopoly problem.
It’s a point that’s worth careful consideration given the warnings in recent days about the power wielded by big technology companies from all over, including the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, and the US Department of Justice’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, who referenced early railroad competition violations in a speech last week on the challenges posed by digital “gatekeepers”. The DoJ and the Federal Trade Commission have recently divided up responsibility for investigating tech companies including Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.
But I think the real action is in the US House of Representatives judiciary committee, which has announced its own investigation into whether antitrust rules need to evolve to meet the challenge of reining in Big Tech.
Over the next 18 months or so, they’ll be holding hearings and, according to insiders, may be interviewing and deposing a variety of high-profile tech leaders as well as competitors who say they’ve been squashed by these companies.
As they consider the issues, they would do well to crack open the short and surprisingly readable 1878 volume Railroads: Their Origins and Problems, by Charles Francis Adams, a former railroad executive and regulator, who lays out the rise of the railways in both Europe and the US, and the struggle to force them to serve the public at large, rather than a handful of 19th-century industrialists.
In a chapter entitled “The Railroad Problem” Adams writes, “as events have developed themselves, it has become apparent that the recognised laws of trade operate but imperfectly at best in regulating the use made of these modern thoroughfares by those who thus both own and monopolise them”.
You could retitle the same chapter “The Internet Problem” and have a good summary of where we are today.
Amazon captures more than one-third of all US online retail spending.
Google represents 88 per cent of the US search engine market, and 95 per cent of all mobile searches.
Two-thirds of all Americans are on Facebook, which having bought Instagram and WhatsApp now owns four of the top eight social media apps.
All of these companies, as well as Apple, the world’s first trillion-dollar company, have come under fire for using their enormous ecosystems to give their own products and services preference, and keep competitors off their networks.
The problem for regulators is that post-1970s, US case law makes it difficult to win an antitrust suit unless you can show that consumer prices have risen due to monopoly power — something that is difficult to prove when dealing with platforms conducting opaque barter transactions （your data for their “free” services）.
As a result, the digital gatekeepers continue to grow.
But the tide may now be turning.
A new paper by Lina Khan, an expert on competition law who works for the House subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative law, makes some sharp comparisons between the railroad problem and the digital gatekeeper problem.
She concludes that we need a separation of platforms and commerce in order to create a more equitable and competitive digital landscape.
That idea is also being pushed by others, including Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.
She has also compared Big Tech to the railroads and believes that companies with more than $25bn in global revenue should not be allowed to own a platform “utility” and also be a participant on that platform.
This evokes the separations imposed on the railroads to prevent them from both creating a marketplace and dominating it.
In 1900, for example, six US rail companies owned or controlled 90 per cent of the market for anthracite coal, resulting in high prices for buyers and massive profits for the railroads — which of course made it difficult for the independent coal companies to move product over their lines.
The problem was eventually rectified through a “commodities clause” that separated platforms and commerce.
This kind of separation eventually made its way into other areas such as banking, preventing bank holding companies from competing with their own clients in various industries, a principle that was at the heart of the Goldman Sachs aluminium hoarding allegations, which came to light in 2013.
It seems obvious to me that we should apply these same standards to the digital giants of today, though you can be certain that they will throw all their lobbying muscle behind trying to prevent this in the coming months.
As Adams pointed out in the 19th century, “the process of amalgamation” that constituted the railroad problem had gone so far that the time was close at hand “when the railroads would manage the state, if the state did not manage the railroads”.
The struggle to regulate Big Tech will tell us much about whether the industrial titans of our own era already control today’s political system.

Back in 2002, serious people were worried about the possibility of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan.
Millions might have died — and the prospect seemed real enough that both the US and the UK advised their citizens to flee the region.
How, then, was the crisis defused?
Thomas Friedman, author of The World Is Flat, is fond of telling the story that US businesses （in particular Dell） told their Indian suppliers （in particular Wipro） to calm things down or get cut out of the loop.
And things did indeed calm down, so perhaps it was the concerns over Dell’s supply chain that prevented catastrophe.
Perhaps.
Mr Friedman duly coined the phrase “the Dell Theory Of Conflict Prevention”: no two countries will go to war if they are part of the same global supply chain.
He was never entirely serious about that, but the question now arises: did he have it backwards?
Rather than a line of defence against hostile action, might supply chains be a line of attack?
One example is the recent executive order banning US companies from working with Huawei, effectively denying the Chinese telecoms company the use of Qualcomm’s chips and Google’s Android operating system.
Another was Mr Trump’s crude — and fleeting — threat to slap tariffs on Mexico if it didn’t satisfy him on immigration policy.
It is tempting to view such actions as uniquely Trumpian.
Would any other president threaten sanctions against one of its largest trading partners, via Twitter, just as they were presenting the new Trump-championed trade agreement to the Mexican senate?
Yet while a different president might act with more subtlety, the US seems unlikely to abandon the aggressive tweaking of the nerves under the skin of the world economy.
Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman — political scientists at George Washington and Georgetown Universities, respectively — have popularised the term “weaponised interdependence”, the title of a forthcoming article in International Security.
Messrs Farrell and Newman point out that supply chains and digital networks can be used both as a “panopticon” to see everything that happens and as a “chokepoint”, denying access to some vital service.
Both approaches require a certain bureaucratic apparatus — something that would be hard to disassemble once in operation.
There is more going on here than the whim of “Tariff Man”.
Consider Swift, the international financial messaging system.
Although Swift does not directly handle transfers of money between banks, it provides the secure service that makes those transfers possible.
Swift is a private company based in Brussels, yet last summer it found itself on the receiving end of US demands to cut off Iranian banks.
The EU, in turn, demanded that it did not comply.
Forced to pick a side in this tug of war, late last year it picked the US.
That is an indication of just how much power the US can wield if it is determined to do so.
And the temptation is strong: it seems far safer to attack Iranian interests through stern letters to a messaging service in Brussels than with a carrier strike group.
That very temptation, of course, risks over-reach.
The US is not the first global superpower to ponder the use of financial and communication networks as a weapon of war.
In the early 20th century, modern economies were increasingly underpinned by complex financing.
Britain viewed the central role of the City of London in the world’s banking, telegraph and marine insurance system as potentially decisive when coupled with the power of the Royal Navy.
Should war break out with Germany, these networks could be used to sustain the UK economy while crushing that of Germany.
The idea seemed plausible, but needless to say, these plans for economic shock and awe failed both to head off the first world war and to limit its duration and brutality.
Two questions arise: would the US be wise to use its economic leverage more sparingly?
And should other nations be building alternative networks beyond the hegemon’s gaze and grip?
It is too easy to say that the US should restrain itself in its own enlightened self-interest.
The logic of network effects is self-reinforcing.
Having established a central position in finance through Wall Street and the mighty dollar, and in digital networks thanks to Silicon Valley and the Pentagon’s role in funding the early internet, the US advantage may endure many abuses.
Still, the more the US seeks to coerce others through its privileged position in banking and the internet, the greater the incentive to develop alternatives that cut the US out of the loop — for example, a Chinese-built operating system for smartphones, or Instex, the special purpose vehicle launched by France, Germany and the UK to allow companies to do business with Iran beyond the reach of US punishment.
Wolfgang Munchau described Instex as “a dysfunctional insurance vehicle for small carpet traders”; it turns out these alternatives are not cheap or easy to develop.
In ordinary circumstances, few would even bother to try.
But if the US presses too painfully on the global economy’s nervous system, its rivals and even its allies will look for relief.

“Nothing is fun until you are good at it,” said Amy Chua in her book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. Eight years later the Yale professor continues to display her prowess.
This week Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld, Ms Chua’s daughter, was hired as a Supreme Court clerk by Brett Kavanaugh — the judge for whom her mother vouched during his stormy Senate hearings last autumn.
Ms Chua is a shrewd string-puller.
A Supreme Court clerkship sets up a young lawyer for life.
Whether she is enjoying the publicity is another matter.
Overnight the Chuas have turned into emblems of what Americans distrust about their meritocracy.
There is much more where that came from.
What Ms Chua did was brazen.
The liberal academic offered a very public endorsement of the conservative Mr Kavanaugh.
As the head of the Yale committee that steers graduates into highly-coveted clerkships, Ms Chua boosted his credibility with her endorsement.
But the apparent quid pro quo was legal.
Actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, on the other hand, are accused of having broken the law.
The first is alleged to have paid $500,000 to fake athletics records that would help her two daughters enter the University of Southern California.
The second has pleaded guilty to paying $15,000 to cheat on her daughter’s standardised admission test.
Both Hollywood actresses, and one of their husbands, face likely jail in the “Operation Varsity Blues” scandal.
Americans would be forgiven for blurring the moral of these tales.
On pure arithmetic, the average American’s chances of entering a top university are tiny if they are born into the wrong home.
Studies show that an eighth grade （14-year-old） child from a lower income bracket who achieves maths results in the top quarter is less likely to graduate than a kid in the upper income bracket scored in the bottom quarter.
This is the reverse of how meritocracy should work.
Children from the wealthiest 1 per cent take more Ivy League places than the bottom 60 per cent combined.
Being born under a roof like Ms Chua’s — with two high-achieving parents obsessed with your success — is almost impossible to match.
That is how most of the world works.
The US has erected three additional barriers.
The first is legacy places.
In contrast to most other democracies, America’s top universities credit an applicant if a parent, or grandparent, went to the school.
A better name for this would be “hereditary preference”, which is antithetical to America’s creed.
Roughly one in six Ivy League places are taken by children of alumni.
This sharply reduces the places available to children of talent from disadvantaged backgrounds.
The second is affirmative action. The courts will soon rule on an Asian-American class action suit alleging that Harvard University discriminated against them. A significant — though artfully selected — share of places are reserved for children of Hispanic and African-American backgrounds. The fact that some of those are also legacy applicants adds a layer of irony. Whichever way it goes, the case is likely to end up in the Supreme Court. Mr Kavanaugh, who is a legacy graduate of Yale, could prove the decisive vote on whether affirmative action will survive. That prospect, too, is rich in irony.
The third barrier is brute wealth.
If you endow a library, or a medical lab, the university will bend over backwards to admit your child.
A prime example is Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, whose poor SAT scores critics perceive may have been outweighed by his father’s $2.5m donation to Harvard.
The US tax system even rewards such palm-greasing by making it tax-deductible.
The fact that the best universities are richer than some countries （Harvard’s $38bn endowment is larger than the GDPs of El Salvador and Nicaragua combined） is no check on their ambitions.
They always want more.
The most egregious figure in the college admissions scandal is William McGlashan, a former partner at TPG, the private equity firm.
He allegedly offered a bribe of $250,000 to get his son into a top university.
His job was to head TPG’s social impact unit — capitalism’s virtue signalling arm.
You do well by doing good, goes the saying. Which brings us back to Ms Chua. The best restraint on any elite is its sense of shame. Without that code, anything is possible. Everyone in America seems to know the system is rigged. The real distinction is whether you rig things from inside the law or outside.

A profound paradox has enveloped global commerce.
On the one hand, it has become absurdly easy and cheap for consumers to push data around the world at lightning speed.
But on the other, it has remained oddly expensive — and slow — for those same consumers to move money across the globe.
Might this change?
Facebook officials hope so: next week they will unveil a white paper outlining ambitious plans to create a new global cryptocurrency system with partners.
The details of this project, codenamed Libra, have been kept secret.
However, reports suggest that the project will involve a crypto “stablecoin” that should allow consumers to make payments as seamlessly as posting a kitten photo, even if they do not have a bank account.
That, at least, is the hope.
At first glance, this may sound crazily audacious, even for Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder.
After all, the word “cryptocurrency” is normally associated with the controversial bitcoin token, and Facebook has never shown the slightest desire to behave like a regulated bank.
But regulators, and incumbent banks, are taking the plans very seriously. Behind the scenes a heated debate has erupted in central bank circles about how they should respond and, crucially, whether they should provide support. Investors need to pay attention, since this may yet change the contours of finance and our idea of what constitutes financial “stability”.
The best way to understand this is to look at an admirably punchy speech that Tobias Adrian, head of the markets division at the IMF, recently gave to a meeting of central bankers in Zurich.
Mr Adrian, whose thinking captures that of many regulators, starts by noting that there is a big difference between the type of project Facebook is contemplating and bitcoin. The latter’s value is determined by supply （how many bitcoins are in circulation） and investor demand, which creates wild price fluctuations.
However, stablecoins are supposedly stable in value since they are tied to an existing fiat currency, such as the dollar.
The IMF prefers to view stablecoins as part of the universe of “emoney”, a sector that, Mr Adrian points out, is already vast in scale.
Kenya, for example, has the wildly successful M-Pesa emoney system, used by 90 per cent of Kenyan adults.
China has WeChat Pay and Alipay, which handle a staggering $18.7tn worth of transactions a year.
That might suggest it should be easy for Facebook to move into the emoney game too.
But there is a catch: the system can only be “stable” if the company issuing emoney has access to matching fiat currency assets, stored in a secure and transparent manner.
There has been surprisingly little public debate around this point （though the Chinese recently tightened regulation, a touch）.
That may be because consumers trust technology groups more than banks.
However, it is also because tech companies are rich and can store their assets with commercial banks.
But IMF officials argue — correctly — that if emoney is now exploding in scale, the system for storing reserves must become more watertight.
They suggest that one option would be to place these reserves with central banks instead.
Unsurprisingly, that idea is controversial in central bank circles.
Some, such as the central banks in France, Switzerland or Sweden, seem cautiously open to this idea.
Others, such as the US Federal Reserve, appear less enthusiastic.
Yet even if some central banks eventually embrace the idea, there is another crucial catch: cross-currency payments.
If a global emoney system was only backed by one currency, then reserves could only be stored at one central bank.
But if the dollar was used, this would promote more “dollarisation” — and no non-America country wishes to see that.
Nor does Facebook, it seems: its stablecoin is likely to be tied to a basket of currencies.
However, central banks do not usually store multicurrency “reserves” for private sector players.
So a global cross-currency reserve system could probably only work if there was a treaty between central banks, or a platform organised by a third party such as the IMF.
And that would be fiendishly difficult.
Will Facebook have a solution to these problems?
It is not yet clear.
But we had better hope that somebody does; as Mr Adrian warns, the “adoption [of emoney] may be extremely rapid” and “raise significant risks”.
Investors should stand warned — along with central bankers.

Argentina and Uruguay were hit by a massive blackout on Sunday which affected more than 40m people in one of the region’s worst ever power outages.
By midday local time, power was gradually returning after Argentina’s interconnection system “collapsed” at 7.07am, according to the country’s energy secretariat.
Two high voltage power lines running south from the Yacyreta hydroelectric dam on Argentina’s border with Paraguay reportedly went down simultaneously and triggered the outage.
The blackout coincided with several regional elections in Argentina on a day of heavy rains across much of the country.
It paralysed public transport and brought many businesses to a standstill.
The incident exposed the vulnerabilities of Argentina’s electricity infrastructure, which suffered years of under-investment after utility tariffs were frozen in the wake of an economic crisis in 2001-2002.
Smaller scale blackouts became a regular feature of life, although the situation began to improve gradually after the government of President Mauricio Macri started to raise electricity tariffs three years ago.
Uruguayan energy company UTE tweeted that the system was being reinstated from scratch.
“There are already coastal cities with service and work continues toward general restoration,” it said.
The episode was compared to a major blackout in Brazil in 2009, when the Itaipu hydroelectric dam on its border with Paraguay left tens of millions of people without electricity.

President Donald Trump stoked fears that his campaign of “maximum pressure” on Iran would lead to military conflict after he blamed Tehran for attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman this week.
Mr Trump has swung like a pendulum on Tehran since he withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal a year ago.
At times he has warned Iran of “severe consequences” if it threatened the US.
But he has also suggested that he wanted to meet the Iranian leadership to negotiate a deal, before saying the time was not right.
“I genuinely believe the president hopes that his approach of maximum pressure will lead to talks but . . . the policy that he has approved may lead to the war that he doesn’t want,” said Robert Malley, a Middle East expert who heads the International Crisis Group.
Mr Trump hopes economic sanctions will force the Iranian regime to the negotiating table but with an increasingly weak bargaining position.
However, there are divisions within the administration and mixed views among experts about whether the policy will reduce tensions with Iran.
These have been mounting since the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal a year ago and escalated dramatically recently with a series of attacks on ships in the Gulf that the US has blamed on Iran.
Trita Parsi, author of the book Losing an Enemy about the Obama administration deal with Iran, said Mr Trump had little interest in military action, but was being misled by John Bolton, national security adviser, and Mike Pompeo, secretary of state.
“The advisers are giving him advice that he believes is an effective way of getting to the [negotiating] table, but they know is an effective way of ensuring it escalates into a military confrontation.”
Both men have denied that the US policy is regime change.
Mr Pompeo last year outlined 12 conditions for any deal with Iran, ranging from measures related to its nuclear and missile activities to ceasing support for terrorist groups.
Bill Burns, head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who served as deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration, said the Trump team were less interested in pursuing a better nuclear deal and more interested in “capitulation across a range of issues, or the regime’s implosion”.
“I don’t think either of those goals are realistic, so we are left with a situation where hardliners in both capitals become mutually enablers and get into a situation that can escalate quickly,” said Mr Burns.
The White House counters that Mr Obama was not tough enough on Iran.
It argues that the nuclear deal was flawed and did not deal with what the Trump administration describes as Iran’s other malign activities, including its support for regional militias and its ballistic missile programme.
“If the maximum pressure campaign doesn’t get them to the table . . . at least it would constrain their resources to the point that they would have fewer options for engaging in the kind of behaviour that we find so problematic,” said one senior administration official.
Some critics argue that Mr Trump has failed to back up his hardline approach on Iran with the kind of diplomacy that was applied in tandem with its economic pressure on North Korea.
And while Mr Trump has tweeted on occasion about wanting to talk to Iran’s leaders, there has been little outreach to make that a reality.
“He started off on a more aggressive path with the North Koreans in 2017, with ‘fire and fury’ but once he came to realise that it could lead to dangerous terrain he was willing to couple it with the other part of the equation （diplomacy）,” said Mr Burns. “But on Iran, that is the kind of missing ingredient.”
The US official responded that Iran was to blame for the lack of high-level engagement, saying its leaders had not been willing to follow in the same steps as North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. “It would be my hope that at some point the Iranian regime decides to take advantage of that opportunity for dialogue, but they’re not there yet.”
Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution, said that while Mr Trump “favours some kind of high-level interaction with the Iranians”, the jury was out on his maximum pressure strategy.
“There is a bit of North Korea and a bit of Venezuela （in Iran policy） but they are obviously strategies that haven’t produced results.”
With the possibility of high-level diplomacy looking remote, the question is how the US will counter what it says are Iranian attacks on tankers in the Middle East.
Anthony Zinni, former head of Central Command, who recently served as an envoy for the Trump administration, said he was concerned about the crisis escalating into conflict.
“When I took over Central Command, my biggest worry was that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps navy would bump our ships,” said Mr Zinni. “It just takes one US navy captain to say that’s too much of a threat and to open up and it escalates from there.”
Another former senior military commander said the US strategy was working in the sense that it “clearly has gotten Iran’s attention and dealt considerable blows to its economy”.
But he said the consequences were “concerning” if you considered the “multiple undoubtedly Iranian attacks on the vessels, numerous drone attacks by Houthis armed by Iran from Yemen on Saudi Arabia, and a resumption of Iranian uranium enrichment”.
“This obviously can spiral downward, as the US at some point will have to respond, and an escalation of violence could result,” said the former commander. “Iran is heading on a very dangerous course”.

Hansoh Pharmaceutical jumped on its first day of trading in Hong Kong, reflecting investor excitement surrounding the city’s second-biggest share offering of the year so far.
Shares in the China-focused drugmaker rose as much as 31 per cent in early trading on Friday, compared to a 0.4 per cent decline in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, which has stuttered this week amid mass protests in the city.
The enthusiastic market debut comes after the company  raised $1bn from investors as part of its initial public offering this month, with Hansoh pricing at the top of its indicated range.
Jiangsu-based Hansoh makes about half of its revenues from cancer drugs but also sells treatments for diabetes and conditions that affect the central nervous system.
The company was founded by Zhong Huijuan, a former chemistry teacher.
Its net income rose 19 per cent to Rmb1.9bn （$275m） and revenues increased 25 per cent to Rmb7.7bn in the 2018 financial year, according to documents filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April.
Its offering came amid a slow year for listings in Hong Kong, which was the world’s top IPO destination in 2018. The biggest offering of the year so far was Chinese securities broker Shenwan Hongyuan in April, raising $1.2bn.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is trying to convince more companies to list in the city, particularly in high-tech industries.
One early victory for the exchange could be Alibaba, which is planning a  secondary listing in Hong Kong this year, which could raise up to $20bn.

A long-delayed programme to link the London and Shanghai stock exchanges will officially launch on Monday, allowing global investors to access shares in Chinese companies and Chinese investors a chance to buy LSE-listed stock.
The scheme, originally scheduled to begin last year, will be launched on the sidelines of a visit by Chinese vice-premier Hu Chunhua to London, during meetings with UK chancellor Philip Hammond.
Chinese state-media reported that the Stock Connect scheme, first announced in 2015, was due to launch in December, but blamed uncertainty created by Brexit for the delay.
“London is a global financial centre like no other, and today’s launch is a strong vote of confidence in the UK market,” Mr Hammond will say. “Stock Connect is a groundbreaking initiative, which will deepen our global connectivity as we look outwards to new opportunities in Asia.”
The Treasury said that UK listed companies would be able to sell shares in China from Monday, and that this was the first time that any foreign company would be able to list in mainland China.
The scheme will differ from a similarly-named initiative launched between Hong Kong and Shanghai in 2014, as the London scheme is limited to trading in depository receipts rather than direct trade in company shares.
People involved in the scheme, who declined to be named, said that unresolved issues and administrative restrictions would render the London-Shanghai Stock Connect largely illiquid, at least at the start of its life.
“It is more of a symbolic move than a genuine opening of a new trading market,” said one person with knowledge of the project.
One of the unresolved problems is a mismatch in trading limits between Shanghai, which has a 10 per cent daily trading limit, and London, which has no trading limits.
Moreover, only some Chinese companies will meet criteria such as having a minimum market capitalisation of Rmb20bn （$2.9bn） to list under the scheme, according to the programme’s draft rules.
Chinese brokerage Huatai Securities said last week that it planned to raise as much as $2bn when it becomes the first Chinese company to list in London as part of the new link.
It will sell global depositary receipts representing about 10 per cent of its outstanding share capital.
“Huatai will offer international investors exposure to China’s financial services market,” Zhou Yi, chairman of the brokerage, said.
China has been pushing policies to attract more inflows into its equity markets in recent years as increasing capital outflows put downward pressure on its currency.
Despite the Hong Kong connect, which allows investors in the former British colony to buy mainland China-listed shares worth Rmb52bn each day, Chinese stock markets were the world’s worst performing last year and the Shanghai exchange has suffered this year from concerns about the deepening US-China trade war.
“The Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect has not had a large impact on Shanghai’s market, so investors are not very excited about the London connect,” said Zhu Bin, a strategic analyst at Chinese brokerage Southwest Securities.
Mr Hammond’s team say the contentious issue of Huawei’s involvement in the development of Britain’s 5G network is not formally on the agenda of Monday’s economic talks, but they expect it to be raised by the Chinese side.
The chancellor will repeat the government’s line that a security review is continuing into the Chinese telecoms company’s future role in Britain.

Foreign direct investment in emerging markets has plunged to its lowest level this century as mounting trade tensions build on weakening economic growth in the developing world.
FDI, which involves buying companies and building new facilities, fell to just 2 per cent of gross domestic product across emerging and frontier markets last year, according to the Institute of International Finance, which tracks cross-border capital flows.
This compares with a peak of 4.4 per cent in 2007, immediately prior to the global financial crisis, as the first chart shows.
The trend, which could further sap weakening economic growth in emerging markets, plays into a narrative of declining globalisation at a time when growth in global trade is also juddering to a halt.
“FDI fell particularly strongly last year as trade policy uncertainty escalated, but also as part of a broader retrenchment of all types of capital flows in the context of the spike of risk aversion, especially in the fourth quarter,” said Guillermo Tolosa, economic adviser at Oxford Economics, a consultancy.
Murat Ulgen, global head of emerging market research at HSBC, who forecast FDI flows would tumble to just 1.5 per cent of EM GDP this year, added: “Given the lingering concerns about global economic activity on the back of rising trade tensions, FDI flows are likely to remain weak in 2019.”
Sergi Lanau, deputy chief economist at the IIF, believed a series of factors had conspired to cause a “secular decline” in FDI in emerging markets since the financial crisis, whether measured in traditional terms or in “true” terms — stripping out reinvested earnings to focus on “new” investment flows — a metric the IIF prefers, illustrated in the second chart.
First, rising commodity prices boosted investment in mining FDI, “which in some countries accounts for a very large share of total FDI,” in the immediate aftermath of the crisis.
However, this has fallen back, in line with commodity prices.
Second, Mr Lanau said the 2000s “were a period of strong growth for developed market banks, which invested heavily in subsidiaries in EM”.
However, “the world looks very different now for banks,” he added.
Third, significant house price increases in emerging markets between 2003 and 2007 led to a rise in real estate-based FDI, “a major category in many countries”.
All three factors “have a lot to do with a period of exuberant asset prices across the board in the run-up to the global financial crisis,” Mr Lanau said, while “years of quantitative easing and low interest rates have encouraged hot money flows to EM,” giving an advantage to portfolio investment over FDI.
“It is not clear to me that these factors are set to reverse any time soon. If anything, growing trade tensions and nationalist political forces around the world will make a turnaround in FDI to EM more difficult,” he added.
Mr Tolosa argued there was a strong correlation between FDI inflows into emerging markets and the degree to which EM economic growth outstrips that of the developed world, a differential that has tumbled from 6.1 percentage points in 2009 to just 2.3 points last year, shown in the third chart.
“FDI to emerging markets in terms of EM GDP has been falling since 2008, in line with the systematic fall of the growth differential of EM and advanced markets,” Mr Tolosa said. “As EMs have become relatively less dynamic, it makes sense they receive less investment.”
In addition, he argued that the opportunities from fiscal or labour arbitrage have declined, while investment has also become more “asset-lite”, meaning fewer dollars are needed for a given impact.
Mr Ulgen suggested rising levels of emerging market corporate debt and higher debt servicing costs may be deterring cross-border merger and acquisition activity in EMs.
He also pointed to tumbling rates of return for foreign direct investment in the emerging world. Returns fell from 10 per cent to 8 per cent between 2012 and 2017, according to Unctad, the UN’s trade and development arm. This is twice the rate of decline in developed markets, as depicted in the final chart, even if returns remain higher in EMs in absolute terms.
The worsening Sino-US trade war may be another factor weighing on activity.
Mr Tolosa noted that the share of inward EM FDI going to China has fallen from a high of 43 per cent in 2015 to 37.3 per cent last year
This is despite China becoming significantly more open to FDI flows, according to the OECD’s FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index, “so the most likely reason for falling flows is trade policy uncertainty,” Mr Tolosa said. “Half of US FDI into China is into the manufacturing sector, which is mostly linked to trade.”
Mr Lanau offered a ray of hope, saying “some would argue that in a world where China isn’t open for business, a lot of FDI would go elsewhere in Asia to redesign supply chains”.
There is some evidence of this happening already as lower value-added manufacturing is increasingly shifted to lower wage Asian economies to escape rising labour costs in China.
The share of emerging market FDI flowing into Asia ex-China has risen from 11.9 per cent in 2011 to 19.6 per cent last year, according to the IIF’s figures, with the likes of the Philippines seeing steep rises, admittedly from a low base.
More recently, Vietnam reported that stake purchases and pledges for new foreign direct investment rose 81 per cent to $14.6bn in the calendar year to April 20, compared with the same period in 2018.
Mr Lanau was doubtful this trend could make a serious dent in the EM-wide FDI drought, however.
“It may happen to some extent but I personally subscribe to the school of thought that in a serious trade war where investing in China becomes difficult, there would be few or no winners,” he added.

China wants to be a superpower, or even the global superpower, by the middle of this century.
That is the meaning of Xi Jinping’s second “centennial goal”: becoming a “strong, democratic, civilised, harmonious and modern socialist country” by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
It won’t be so.
Whether you use the original definition of superpower status — the possession of pre-eminent military power and the ability to project it globally — or whether you broaden it to include economic, political, cultural and intelligence power, and the ability to shape international governance, what matters is the long-term capacity to pay for it all.
The costs China bears today are small compared with those it would need to shoulder — for decades — as a superpower.
Its military expenditure falls far short of America’s.
Domestically, the costs of repression and stability are said to be even greater than the budget of the People’s Liberation Army.
An ageing population of 1.4bn requires a comprehensive social security system.
The costs of rectifying the environment are mind-boggling.
Assume no US growth until 2049 and China’s GDP would need to increase at nearly 6 per cent every year （few believe it has been that high of late） just to match America’s 2018 per capita income.
Such smooth growth defies all empirical experience.
It also assumes that the renminbi peg survives in perpetuity.
George Magnus, in his excellent book Red Flags, lays out why the peg is crucial and why it will break within five years.
China had been driving up an economic cul-de-sac and needed to find a new road.
Hence, in 2013 Xi Jinping launched his reform programme, declaring that the economic model of the time was “uncoordinated, unbalanced and unsustainable” — words used earlier by former premier Wen Jiabao and repeated in 2017 by politburo member Yang Jiechi.
That year, a think-tank of China’s National Development and Reform Commission described reform progress as minimal.
Today, the Rhodium Group’s excellent quarterly evaluations assess reform progress as rudimentary.
This is no surprise.
There is a contradiction at the heart of reform, between the Leninist need to hold on to the levers of economic power （to avoid the rise of economic interests that might turn political and mutter “no taxation without representation”） and giving more play to the market.
Reform aside, there are three obstacles to China’s long-term economic growth.
The first is the debt problem.
At some stage, the costs of debt have to be borne, whether by people, companies or the government, and whether by inflating debt away, increasing taxation or cutting public investment and spending.
The second obstacle is demographics.
While China’s population will continue to grow for perhaps a decade, its labour force is already shrinking — precipitously.
China’s official birth rate of 1.6 children per woman is one of the world’s lowest, even as its population ages.
The costs of social security, of caring for the elderly, will be enormous.
Labour productivity must rise very quickly.
Another demographic fact is worrying in terms of instability: gender imbalance.
The old one child policy reinforced cultural preferences, meaning that over the coming decades China will have between 30m and 40m men in the sexually active bracket of 20-40 years of age who will not find a partner.
Their frustration may lead to unrest and instability.
The third problem, and perhaps the greatest, is a looming water crisis in 12 northern provinces that account for 41 per cent of China’s population, 38 per cent of its agriculture, 46 per cent of its industry and 50 per cent of its power generation. Neither water transfers nor desalination can prevent severe economic, social and political dislocation. What is required, if it is not already too late （and climate change looks likely to make the region drier）, are massive changes in agriculture, industry and people’s lifestyles. A prime instrument would be the correct pricing of water. But raising the price by many times, as the head of one Beijing water company suggested （only to be told to pipe down）, is politically impossible: the Chinese Communist party （CCP） fears that the resulting dislocation and inflation would cause unrest.
It is commonly said that if any government is capable of pushing through change, however unpopular, it is the CCP.
If that were so, Mr Xi would not have expended so much energy in cajoling and excoriating officials for failure to implement his policies.
The governance model is flawed: 1.4bn people cannot be governed using top down fiat and inspection, while eschewing self-regulation.
Yet Mr Xi has specifically turned his back on four useful allies: the rule of law and an independent judiciary, which is essential for business and private sector confidence; a free press, for example to help expose corruption or abuse of the environment; civil society, from where ideas, innovation and pressure flow; and some sort of political accountability, to encourage officials to work for the benefit of the people and not of themselves or the party.
All four of those allies weaken party controls and risk leading eventually to a pluralist system, undermining one party rule.
So the CCP rejects them.
To the factors above can be added a lack of trust by the people in the CCP.
Nationalism is an inadequate substitute.
To give one example of this lack of trust, consider the internationalisation of the Chinese currency.
A superpower must surely have a currency that is freely traded throughout the world.
But what would happen if China opened its capital account?
Because the people don’t trust the party, today’s capital flight would become a flood.
Investors would abandon the current destination of their savings, the domestic housing market.
Its collapse would precipitate a recession and unemployment.
And the number one fear of the party is instability caused by unemployment.
If you claim credit for all good things, you also earn discredit for the bad.
Could innovation come to the CCP’s rescue?
A high-tech society with high productivity might help China grow out of debt, need fewer workers and cope with less water.
Mr Xi himself in a January 2016 speech said that “Innovation is China’s Achilles heel”.
He may be right.
The devotion of great resources to scientific research may help China to produce exciting technologies.
But this might, as in the Soviet Union, be on too narrow a front.
Many scholars （admittedly, western） have concluded that the motor for the rise of Europe was the free flow of ideas.
A taste for iconoclasm and a refusal to accept convention may also have helped.
CCP control is sympathetic to none of those.
Culture, reinforced by politics, does not favour the unconventional.
And with prioritisation of state-owned enterprises over the private sector, added to tightened party control over business, education and society, it is legitimate to wonder whether in future the likes of Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent will emerge as easily.
Some point to the CCP’s flexibility: in 1978, who could have imagined that it would slough off so much dogma?
But there is an important difference between the first 30 years of reform and the last 10.
Earlier, the interests of reform and of party members were heading in the same direction: much money could be made, legitimately and not so legitimately, by following the dictates of reform.
Now, even with a restricted role for the market, they are heading in opposite directions.
The war on corruption reinforces this.
The likelihood is that we have reached “peak Xi”, or perhaps “plateau Xi”, since China will continue to be a powerful country.
In the recent words of Chen Deming, minister of commerce until 2013: “Do not take it for granted that China is number two, and do not make the assumption that we will be the number one sooner or later.”
What does this mean for liberal democracies? If China’s rise is not inexorable （nor its collapse inevitable: it will remain a major power）, we must in the meantime be more resolute in defending our security, interests and values. We should resist any tendency towards pre-emptive kowtowing to China. We must promote what is essential for long-term prosperity, not least respect for international law, which China may further flout as its problems increase.
In sum, despite our present woes, we should have more faith in our systems.
Their virtue is not English oak, but more Chinese bamboo: they bend in the buffeting winds, but don’t break.
Those who said that China’s rise would lead to convergence with liberal democracies are now accused of getting it wrong.
But the obverse of the same coin, that unless China changes its systems, it has no chance of being a superpower, may be correct.
Charles Parton is a senior associate fellow of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank.
He was an adviser to the UK House of Commons select committee on foreign affairs inquiry into China.

Alon Alperovitz took a business masters degree at London School of Economics because he wanted to switch career.
By the time he graduated, in 2018, the former operation and relationship manager at the Academic College of Tel Aviv Yaffo had started two new jobs.
From Monday to Friday, Mr Alperovitz is the business improvement architect at the London headquarters of Ted Baker, the UK clothes retailer.
On Sundays, he is an entrepreneurship tutor, logging on from his living room sofa to lead a classroom of a dozen students in Tel Aviv.
“I love it,” Mr Alperovitz says about his weekend teaching role.
He works for Jolt, an Israeli technology start-up that brings students into physical classrooms to be taught from a screen by experts working remotely.
The gig economy-based business model works for Mr Alperovitz, who took on the job as a way of sharing his knowledge and passion for start-ups.
He did not expect to make a living from it.
The set-up is easy.
He just needs a high-speed internet connection.
“We have a six-month-old baby so my wife takes her to a separate area of the house while I am online,” he says.
Jolt was founded in 2015 in Tel Aviv and has expanded into London and New York.
Students attend the classes in person and are taught key workplace skills, such as negotiation techniques, time management and how to solve problems faster.
Jolt aims to “reinvent learning”, according to Roei Deutsch, the company’s co-founder and chief executive. “In the 21st century, learning one subject at university just doesn’t cut it any more,” he says. “Employees need to be constantly expanding their skills, and Jolt solves this problem with stackable classes that fit around your lifestyle.”
The company raised $7.2m in an equity funding round led by European tech VC Octopus Ventures, mainly to build the London classroom, which opened in January.
Developing each venue is expensive because everything in the teaching rooms, from the central table around which the students sit, to the web conferencing software, has been designed so that the lesson can be run remotely by one person.
“The learning and development market is ripe for disruption,” says Simon King, a principal at Octopus Ventures. This is what business schools call executive education — and it is worth about $100bn, according to Mr King.
Students of Jolt, known as “sojis”, pay a membership fee of £100-a-month, for which they receive an allocation of “coins”, Jolt’s currency, to fund four 90-minute classes or buy Jolt stationery and merchandise.
Additional coins can be earned by turning up on time regularly and not cancelling bookings or can be purchased through the Jolt smartphone app.
Any coins left unspent at the end of a month are rolled over.
Sophie Mackenzie, assistant digital fundraising manager at the British Red Cross, was an early Jolt member in London.
“Within my sector learning and development is fairly limited, due to the lack of funding for this type of extracurricular activity in non-profits,” she says.
Ms Mackenzie, who moved into her first management role last year, aged 24, was introduced by a friend who was a member and signed up at a taster event near Jolt’s London office in Shoreditch, the centre of east London’s tech start-up community.
“It completely busted all [my] prejudices against networking and panel discussions,” Ms Mackenzie recalls. “I actually really, really enjoyed it.”
Jolt sessions are run in a similar manner to business school seminars, where participants are encouraged to participate as much as possible.
They may seem like networking events but they are actually something different.
I meet Ms McKenzie at a public speaking class in the London venue, alongside a dozen other sojis.
For an education start-up that claims to be making learning more accessible, the room is difficult to locate, in a half-finished new office development in a side street around the back of the financial district’s hub station, Liverpool Street.
The only clue to Jolt’s existence is a sheet of A4 paper with ‘Jolt’ on it, stuck to the front door.
Once inside, however, the decor is smart.
A screen fills one wall of the classroom, from which extends a large curved wooden table.
The dozen or so students sit around this.
There are also framed prints of motivational phases, such as “always learning”, and cabinets filled with Jolt merchandise.
Mr Deutsch runs a finger along the teaching table in the room, noting that its curved shape is specifically designed to enable the tutor to see each student.
It is attached to the screen at one end to emphasise the “connection” between the tutor on screen and the people in the room.
“This could be seen as a wasted piece of wood,” he says, measuring with his hands the width of the wood between the presenting screen and the first student’s chair.
“But because it is connected to the screen we have shown that it actually improves the amount of participation of the person sitting here by hundreds of per cent.”
Jolt has entered a crowded market.
Taking a slice of the huge executive education market, previously dominated by business schools, has been an aspiration of many technology companies.
Only healthcare is a bigger market globally, according to Beauhurst, a London-based analyst for young high-growth companies.
Out of the 399 “edtech” companies Beauhurst tracks, there are just 54 that are defined as professional development companies such as Jolt.
But these professional development companies have raised higher amounts on average than their peers in edtech, such as online coding clubs, and were more likely to achieve a successful exit in terms of an initial public offering or sale to another company.
Last year was the biggest on record for professional development start-ups in the UK, according to Beauhurst, with £25.4m raised over 15 deals.
Since the beginning of 2019, a further £5.1m has been raised in another four deals.
The plan has to be to “go big or go home”, according to Mr Deutsch.
“This is like a military spectacle, an experience,” he says, casting an arm around Jolt’s London room.
“We can only do this, however, if we do it at scale.”

Washington’s most powerful business group is urging the Trump administration to end its trade war with China, saying that its tariffs risk costing the US economy $1tn over the next decade.
In a strongly worded submission to the Office of the US Trade Representative, the US Chamber of Commerce calls for a reversal of tariffs imposed over the past two years and says proposed tariffs on a further $300bn of Chinese imports would “dramatically expand the harm already done” to US consumers, workers and companies.
President Donald Trump’s trade strategy has forced many companies to raise prices and reroute their supply chains, fraying relations with a business community that had welcomed his agenda of corporate tax cuts and deregulation. Last week  600 companies, including the retailers Walmart, Target and J Crew, put their names to a letter warning that the proposed tariffs could lead to 2m job losses and cost the average American family $2,000.
A survey released last week by the Business Roundtable found that the escalating trade war had sent  CEOs’ confidence in the outlook for the US economy down for a fifth straight quarter.
Jamie Dimon, chairman of the blue-chip lobby group and chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, told reporters that Mr Trump’s threatened next wave of 25 per cent tariffs would add to the risk of an economic downturn.
James Gorman, chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley, separately warned an investor conference last week that a full-blown trade war would be “a disaster” that could tip the US into a recession.
The submission from the US Chamber says it shares the administration’s concerns about Chinese intellectual property rights violations, forced technology transfers, and state interventions but describes its policy of imposing unilateral tariffs as counterproductive.
“Tariffs are hidden, regressive taxes that are being paid by US businesses and consumers,” it says, referring back to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to warn that “unilateral tariff strategies have no record of historical success and have always led to unintended consequences”.
Instead, the US Chamber urged the Trump administration to reopen negotiations with Beijing and work with allies “with the aim of striking a high-standard, comprehensive, enforceable agreement that puts an end to tariffs already in place and forestalls further disruptions to the livelihood of all Americans”.
Mr Trump has said he expects to meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at this month’s G20 summit despite “testy” relations between the powers.
The US Trade Representative’s office will begin seven days of hearings on the latest proposed tariffs on Monday.
Those due to testify range from specialist groups such as the American Sportfishing Association and the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association to multibillion-dollar companies including Best Buy, Hasbro and HP.

Two oil tankers were severely damaged by attacks in the Gulf of Oman between Iran and the Arabian peninsula yesterday in a sharp escalation of Middle East tensions that sparked a 4 per cent surge in crude prices.
The ships, one Japanese and one Norwegian-owned, were hit by unknown weapons and abandoned close to the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world’s busiest shipping routes and a chokepoint for exports out of the oil-rich region.
There was no claim of responsibility for the attacks, the latest in a string of assaults on oil and transport facilities in and around the Gulf in recent weeks as hostility between the US and Iran has heightened fears of conflict.
The incidents pushed the price of Brent oil up by as much as 4.5 per cent.
Prices slipped back later in the day but remained 2.7 per cent higher, the largest one-day gain since April.
The US Navy said it was assisting the tankers after receiving distress calls.
Washington has been heaping intense pressure on Iran since President Donald Trump last year withdrew the US from a landmark 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran and reimposed sanctions.
Washington has warned of unspecified “escalatory” action by Tehran and sent more military assets to the region.
After sabotage attacks on four tankers last month, US officials said they suspected Iran was behind them.
Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, said “suspicious doesn’t begin to describe” yesterday’s tanker strikes and the fact that they coincided with a meeting in Tehran between supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s ultimate decision maker, and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.
Mr Abe is seeking to ease US-Iran tensions.
But after meeting the Japanese leader, Mr Khamenei ruled out any talks with the US, dashing hopes that Tokyo could attempt to mediate between Tehran and Washington.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran has no trust in America,” Mr Khamenei said.
There was no immediate official comment from Washington.
Both Iran and the US insist they do not want war.
But diplomats fear that the rising tensions could lead to a “miscalculation” that would risk triggering a conflict.
The Norwegian-owned tanker Front Altair was leaving the Gulf after loading at Ruwais in the United Arab Emirates.
Kokuka Courageous, the Japanese ship, had loaded at Jubail in Saudi Arabia.
The UAE and Saudi Arabia are staunch US allies that support the Trump administration’s efforts to pressure Tehran and push back against Iranian influence in the region.
António Guterres, UN secretary-general, told the UN Security Council: “I strongly condemn any attack against civilian vessels. Facts must be established and responsibilities clarified.”
Helima Croft, a former CIA analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the attacks undoubtedly raised the risk of a confrontation between the US and Iran: “These are the types of incidents that we have been warning about and that can lead the region to the brink of war.”
Iranian television showed footage of a fire blazing in a large hole on the Front Altair as a tower of black smoke billowed upwards from its scorched hull.
Kokuka Sangyo, owner of the Kokuka Courageous, said it had received a report that the vessel was hit by two shells, three hours apart.
“The first shell hit the rear of the ship on the port side. The second shell hit port amidships and the captain decided to evacuate.”

The home secretary has signed an extradition warrant allowing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to be extradited to the US, where he faces charges of conspiring to hack government computers and violating espionage law.
Sajid Javid announced yesterday that he had formally agreed to the request, which was received from the US justice department this week.
“He [Assange] is rightly behind bars,” Mr Javid told the BBC.
“There is an extradition request from the US that is before the courts tomorrow but yesterday I signed the extradition order and certified it and that will be going in front of the courts tomorrow.”
Westminster magistrates' court will hold an administrative hearing into Assange’s case today but has not yet set a date for a full extradition hearing, which could take place later this year.
Assange is fighting the extradition and is likely to argue that his removal to the US breaches his human rights.
The court will decide whether the case meets the legal test for Assange to be extradited to the US; it will not decide whether he is guilty or innocent of the US allegations.
The WikiLeaks founder can challenge any decision by the magistrates’ court via an appeals process, which could take many months and see the case go to the High Court.
Assange was arrested at the Ecuadorean embassy in April, where he had spent seven years under diplomatic protection avoiding extradition.
However, after a series of disagreements with his hosts, he was handed over to UK police with the co-operation of the Ecuadorean government.
A London court in May sentenced him to 50 weeks in prison for jumping bail in 2012.
The Home Office said yesterday that Assange had been arrested in relation to “a provisional extradition request” from the US relating to “offences including computer misuse and the unauthorised disclosure of national defence information”.

Chinese industrial output slumped to its lowest level in more than 17 years in May, as the world’s second-biggest economy wrestles with reignited trade tensions with the US.
Data published by China’s National Bureau of Statistics on Friday showed that growth in industrial output slipped to 5 per cent year on year in May, its weakest showing since February 2002, and lower than the prior month’s reading of 5.4 per cent.
The figure was also significantly below the 5.5 per cent in growth predicted by economists polled by Reuters.
Some segments of the Chinese economy did show some vigour during May.
Retail sales in China rebounded strongly to 8.6 per cent during May, up from April’s rate of 7.2 per cent, which had been the worst monthly showing since 2003.
Economists polled by Reuters had been predicting retail sales growth of just 8.1 per cent for May.
The disappointing industrial production numbers reflect an escalation in  trade tensions between the United States and China.
In mid-May, US president Donald Trump raised tariffs to 25 per cent on $200bn of Chinese goods.
Beijing retaliated  by increasing levies on about $60bn of US imports.
While the Chinese economy grew at a faster pace than forecast in the first quarter compared with the final three months of 2018, analysts say much of that was down to stimulus measures and loosening of credit flows.
Recent data points, including credit growth, have been weaker than expected.
Beijing has stepped up support measures in recent weeks, such as encouraging local governments to use  special bonds for major projects in a bid to support economic growth.
“Fiscal stimulus could increase and will mainly be through speeding up existing infrastructure investment as planned as well as adding new infrastructure projects,” said Iris Pang, an economist at ING.

Hong Kong workers faced disruption on their morning commutes as police shut a major metro interchange and central government offices remained closed after protests against a controversial extradition bill turned violent on Wednesday.
A government statement issued on Thursday morning said its central offices, which had been surrounded by tens of thousands of protesters  on Wednesday to protest legislation that would allow individuals to be sent to China for trial, would be closed for security reasons. It was unclear if closure included the nearby Legislative Council building.
Police used tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds on the mostly peaceful protesters leaving at least 72 people injured after demonstrators occupied main roads.
The MTR said trains would not be stopping at Admiralty station on request from the police.
The interchange serves office towers that house banks and major accounting firms.
Roads in the central business district that had remained occupied past midnight had been cleared of protesters on Thursday morning.
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s leader has remained steadfast in her commitment to introducing the legislation, dismissing a protest on Sunday that was the territory’s largest since its handover to China from Britain in 1997. She appeared tearful in a television interview on Wednesday, denying claims that she had sold out Hong Kong.
A small-scale cleanup operation had begun near the site of street occupations on Thursday morning.
“There is a lot of mess yesterday that’s why we came this early and that’s why we try to clean it up as quickly as possible to make it look not too ugly internationally,” said a 20-year-old female student picking up trash next to the city’s war memorial, who refused to give her name.
A handful of protesters dressed in black remained nearby.

In a red-brick building in the suburbs of the English city of Cambridge, a group of young computer scientists chat and joke about the latest tweaks to their codes.
But rather than a new iPhone app, they are attempting to create the next “ bond king” out of algorithms and data.
Dressed casually in jeans and T-shirts, Cantab Capital’s brainiacs — with backgrounds in fields such as astrophysics and molecular biology — are writing programmes that surf the undulations of the bond market.
The aim: to copy the best features of human traders but without any of their foibles or frailties.
“An active credit trader is ‘feeling the tape’. We want our models to replicate that behaviour,” says Anthony Lawler, co-head of GAM Systematic, the arm of the Swiss asset manager that owns Cantab.
This is the new world of bond investing. An old-fashioned industry that for decades has largely been the preserve of imperious fund managers in London, New York or Los Angeles barking trades down the phone to their brokers — the best ones routinely anointed “ bond kings” by the press — is now being targeted by computer-driven hedge funds keen to boost their returns.
“This feels like the early days of the ‘quant’ equity industry,” says Paul Kamenski, co-head of credit at Man Group’s Numeric unit, alluding to the development of “quantitative” strategies in the stock market.
“A lot of the research is in the early stage but the pace of advancement is likely to be faster. There’s a realisation that this is an untapped market.”
Man Numeric launched a systematic bond platform late last year, initially focused on US junk bonds but with plans to expand it into investment-grade corporate debt over the next year.
Man is wary of giving away too much detail, but one area the hedge fund has found fruitful is “ alternative data”, non-traditional information such as credit card purchases, trade receipts and shipping data.
This can help to parse private companies that do not disclose regular financial statements and to map out linkages between companies that are competitors and clients.
It can also exploit leads and lags between how their bonds react to developments.
For example, if a cement company seems to be doing well, then it might indicate that the homebuilders it supplies are also booming.
One big barrier has been the complexity of the bond market — especially corporate debt.
Whereas a company may issue just one or two types of equity, it could issue tens or even hundreds of types of bonds, with varying legal safeguards, currency, maturity and coupon payments.
Moreover, big macroeconomic shifts — such as interest rates — can have a major but unpredictable impact.
Yet advances in computing, cleaner, longer-term trading data and a critical mass of bond market research have now created a tipping point for systematic fixed income investing, according to Linda Gruendken, lead scientist at Cantab.
Not everyone is convinced that bond markets represent a new gold rush for quants.
Mihir Worah, one of Pimco’s top executives who leads its own quant efforts, points out that groups like his have already been mining the bond market’s inefficiencies for decades.
“It’s the next frontier. But the pickings may not be quite as fertile as some people think, as the easy pickings are already done,” he says.
Trading is the biggest challenge.
Trading volumes in bonds tend to be much lower than in the stock market, and transaction costs are high.
This means that even potentially lucrative signals can be difficult to exploit in practice.
Cantab tries to minimise this problem by trading the more liquid credit derivatives and indices of credit derivatives, rather than the underlying bonds.
Even so, a human touch is needed.
Cantab’s algorithm — named “Gekko” after the famously greedy financier Gordon Gekko of the film Wall Street — will spit out orders in neat sentences.
But a human trader still has to copy the sentence and paste it into the live chat windows he or she has open with the banks.
GAM’s shift into credit comes as the firm tries to revive its fortunes following a scandal surrounding a top fund manager, which came after a big writedown on the acquisition of Cantab. Last year Cantab’s Quantitative fund lost 23 per cent, although this year it is up 22 per cent.
AQR, the quant investment group that launched its first systematic bond fund last year, faces a similar challenge. “When the rubber hits the road, someone sometimes has to do the trades,” concedes Scott Richardson, co-head of fixed income at AQR. “There are times the model will want to execute a trade and we can’t do it.”
However, bond markets are also slowly but surely becoming more reliant on machines.
At the moment only smaller trades can be automated, with big-ticket or more bespoke deals still arranged by messages and phone calls.
But some predict that we are only at the early stages of a bond market revolution.
“We are at the infancy of quantitative fixed income investing, but we are also at the infancy of electronic fixed income market-making,” says Robert Lam, the other co-head of credit at Man Numeric. “Structurally, credit markets are changing.”

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Saudi Arabia would “not hesitate” to defend its interests as Riyadh joined the US in blaming Iran for last week’s attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf.
Prince Mohammed, the kingdom’s de facto leader, said Saudi Arabia did not want a conflict in the region, but his comments were indicative of rising tensions in the oil-rich Gulf.
They came days after two tankers — one loaded with methanol from Saudi Arabia — were damaged, forcing their crews to evacuate.
Last month, four tankers, including two Saudi vessels, were also struck by “sabotage attacks” in the same coastal waters of the United Arab Emirates.
The incidents have raised concerns about the vulnerability of energy supplies around the vital shipping route through the Strait of Hormuz.
“The kingdom doesn’t want a war in the region, but we will not hesitate to deal with any threat to our people, sovereignty and vital interests,” Prince Mohammed said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.
“The choice before Iran is clear. Does it want to be a normal country that has a constructive role in the international community, or remain a rogue state?” he continued.
“We hope that the Iranian regime would choose to become a normal country and cease its aggressive approach.”
Khalid al-Falih, Saudi energy minister, said on Saturday that there “must be a rapid and decisive response to the threat of energy supplies”.
His comments were echoed by Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, the UAE’s foreign minister, who on Saturday called on friendly nations to confront “fascist regimes that seek to destroy the region”.
In addition to the tanker incidents, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are aligned to Iran, last month claimed responsibility for drone attacks on oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia and fired a missile at a Saudi airport last week, injuring more than 20 people.
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi lead an Arab coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen and are the staunchest backers of US president Donald Trump’s administration in its efforts to push back against Iran’s influence.
Mr Trump said on Friday that last week’s attacks had Iran “written all over it”.
Washington released a grainy video purporting to show Iranian forces alongside one of the damaged tankers hours after the attacks removing a mine from the vessel.
The US military said on Sunday that an Iranian missile attempted to shoot down a US drone to disrupt surveillance of “the IRGC [Iranian Revolutionary Guards] attack” on one of the tankers.
It said the missile got within about 1km of the drone.
Tehran has rejected the allegations and said the timing of the incident, which coincided with a meeting between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Islamic republic’s supreme leader, and Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, in Tehran was highly suspicious.
Mr Abe was seeking to de-escalate tensions and potentially mediate.
Prince Mohammed said Iran did not respect Mr Abe and “practically responded to his efforts by attacking two oil tankers, one of them Japanese”.
Ali Larijani, Iran’s parliamentary speaker, countered on Sunday that “the suspicious actions against the oil tankers” appeared to be a “complementary measure” to the crippling sanctions the US had imposed on the Islamic republic.
Iran accuses Mr Trump of waging an “economic war” against the republic and says the US is pushing for regime change.
In recent weeks, Tehran has been proposing regional dialogue to ease tensions, but has ruled out talks with Washington.

Lawyers for Wu Xiaohui, the jailed former chief executive of Anbang Insurance, have been unable to meet their client for almost a year, raising concerns over his safety, as fears of the Chinese judicial system give rise to protests in Hong Kong.
Wu was sentenced to 18 years in jail in May 2018 for fraud and embezzlement.
His lawyers filed an appeal in May.
The uncertainty over Wu’s fate in prison comes as an estimated 1m people took to the streets in Hong Kong on Wednesday to protest against an extradition law that would turn suspects over to mainland Chinese police without trial.
Anbang was formally taken over by Chinese regulators in February 2018, months after Wu was detained in a midnight raid on his offices in Beijing. Anbang had aggressively sold high-interest, short-term life insurance, becoming a symbol of excess in the industry and sparking concern it would be unable to meet its obligations.
Lawyer Zhou Ze said in a post on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, that he was blocked from meeting his client at Shanghai’s Baoshan Prison on Tuesday.
“After taking photos of our lawyer’s licences and the appeal commission procedure, the prison guards told us that the prison would not receive us and would not arrange a meeting,” Mr Zhou wrote.
His post and the hashtag “Anbang Wu Xiaohui’s appeal case” were subsequently deleted by censors.
Asked about Wu’s current status Mr Zhou said: “I don’t know. I haven’t seen him in nearly a year.”
Central government offices in Hong Kong were closed on Thursday, after the mostly peaceful mass protests on Wednesday were punctuated by sporadic clashes with police.
The Hong Kong government said an extradition law was necessary to return criminal fugitives to the mainland but several extrajudicial cross-border kidnappings of booksellers and businessmen have made residents of Hong Kong nervous.
At least one Hong Kong businessman was tortured to death while in Chinese custody in recent years.
Wu’s case is unusual because white-collar Chinese convicts generally enjoy access to lawyers while in custody.
Some have been able to manage their businesses from jail, and one even fought off a foreign takeover of his business from behind bars.
Anbang declined to comment.
Another lawyer for Wu who was contacted by the Financial Times said he was under orders not to speak about the case.
Public security officials in Shanghai did not respond to requests for comment.

Investors exhaled last weekend when Donald Trump pulled back from an escalatory tariff war with Mexico.
But their relief is bound to be shortlived.
Whenever the US president finds fault with another country, he reaches first for tariffs.
His grievances need have nothing to do with trade: in Mexico’s case, Mr Trump was furious at the persistence of the migrant crisis on the US border.
Nor does he try to link his actions to statutory cause.
Mr Trump threatened Mexico under a 1977 act that authorises the president to impose penalties on America’s enemies, terrorist states and other pariahs.
Mexico does not resemble any such country.
The same applies to his serial misuse of section 232, intended to protect the US from strategic threats, to impose tariffs on America’s friends.
Under no sensible assessment can Canadian metals, or European cars, be defined as a threat to US national security.
Mr Trump shows every sign of continuing to abuse his powers.
It is long overdue for Congress to reclaim its constitutional role on trade.
To be fair to the normally acquiescent Republicans, Mr Trump’s party has led the way in opposing his Mexico belligerence.
Normally loyal senators, such as Ted Cruz of Texas and Iowa’s Chuck Grassley, attacked Mr Trump’s over-reach.
Others, including Utah’s Mike Lee and Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey, are drafting a bill that would limit the president’s powers.
Such a law is firmly in the US national interest.
For the past 70 years, US presidents have used their leeway to promote intelligent global trade deals.
Only sparingly did they use national security or emergency powers to curb imports.
Even then, their actions were clearly telegraphed, mostly shortlived and widely debated.
Mr Trump has put a torch to that tradition.
Even on China, which comes closest among his targets to posing a national security threat, Mr Trump has traduced his powers in both directions.
More than once he has hinted he would lift the ban on Huawei, the China telecoms company, in exchange for concessions from Beijing.
Either an entity poses a security threat or it does not.
Huawei arguably does.
European aluminium imports do not.
Mr Trump makes no distinction.
The fact that Congress wants to rein him in on free trade grounds is no small irony.
The general rule of US politics has been that Congress is too sectional to be entrusted with oversight of America’s larger commercial interests.
The White House was always seen as pro-trade; Congress as protectionist.
That rule is now turning on its head.
Not only are free-trade Republicans digging in their heels. Democrats are also taking a larger view of the US national interest. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker, is even willing to pass Mr Trump’s modestly renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement. This is in spite of the fact that the minor changes Mr Trump struck were taken almost word for word from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Barack Obama negotiated and most Democrats opposed.
The thrust of the coming legislation is clear.
The White House would have to seek congressional approval for emergency tariffs.
This would remove a large element of instability from the global economy.
For that reason, Mr Trump would almost certainly veto the bill — in which case both houses of Congress would need a two-thirds majority to override it.
The odds against that are high.
But we live in fluid times.
Three years ago no one would have predicted Capitol Hill would be the wiser branch of government on trade.
Such a law would go some way towards rebuilding faith in America’s system.

Car manufacturers in China saw their sales fall by nearly a fifth last month as consumers in the world’s largest vehicle market remained reluctant to purchase due to new emissions rules and concerns about the economy.
Key passenger vehicles sales fell 17.4 in May compared with the same month last year, following a 17.7 per cent decline in April, according to wholesale data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
In the overall market, vehicle sales fell 16.4 per cent in May, their fastest year-on-year decline on record, mainly due to a sharp drop in sales of commercial vehicles such as buses and trucks, which fell 11.8 per cent, the association said.
China’s passenger vehicle market shrunk for the first time since the 1990s last year, due to a reduction in subsidies for buyers and an economic slowdown which knocked consumer confidence, hitting revenue for the world’s largest carmakers such as GM and Volkswagen. GM’s China sales decreased 17.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2019.
All major foreign brands, with the exception of Toyota and Honda, saw a year-on-year sales decline in May as consumers wait to buy cars ahead of stricter vehicle emissions regulations, which go into effect in many Chinese cities from July.
“The emissions policy is a key reason for the decline,” said Paul Gong, an auto analyst at UBS.
Retail sales by car dealers fell more slowly last month with a 12.5 per cent decline as dealers worked through their unsold stock.
Beijing has announced several policies to support the sector such as a tax cut for rural consumers, while cities such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen announced they would increase the issuance of licence plates by up to 50 per cent.
“Consumers are waiting for stimulus policies,” Jefferies analyst Patrick Yuan wrote in a note.
“We believe car wholesale volumes will remain weak in June given the current complexity.”
Car company executives expect the market to pick up in the second half of the year once the emissions regulations are introduced.
The measures mean China’s auto sales can grow by 2 per cent this year, according to analysts at Moody’s.
Some analysts argue that the worsening of the trade war between China and the US, with both sides introducing new tariffs in the past month, will hit the car market.
“The economy in China is still struggling to get on its feet and the trade war is heating up which might have an effect on household sentiment,” said Jochen Siebert of consultancy JSC Automotive, who forecasts sales could decline 5 per cent this year.

Chinese technology companies such as Huawei have been among the chief targets of the trade dispute with the US.
The Trump administration’s desire to exclude them from the US is driven by security and economic concerns, and the hope of preserving US tech dominance.
In reality, banning Chinese companies may do more to harm America.
A “Fortress America” approach, restricting access to the global marketplace, may only spur Chinese innovation.
At worst, it could lead to the splitting of the internet between US and Chinese spheres.
In the long term, the Trump administration could be hoisted with its own protectionist petard.
American restrictions on Chinese technology have intensified since 2018.
Last August, a defence bill prohibited the US government and its grantees from using Huawei telecoms equipment.
The Chinese company was added last month to the US “entity list”, requiring American companies to receive a government license to sell to it.
President Donald Trump has also empowered commerce secretary Wilbur Ross to ban any technology company considered to pose a national security risk.
Mr Ross is due to make his decision in just over three months.
The desire to protect national security is understandable, not least given the close relationship between Chinese tech companies and the state.
Security in the digital age is porous, however.
By engaging with Chinese technology, western intelligence services can glean important information.
Forcing Huawei to move to its own system may actually weaken security, according to Google.
The US tech group, which restricted Huawei’s access to parts of its Android operating system last month, has warned that a Chinese version might be more vulnerable to hacking.
The second belief is that the US can stifle Huawei and other tech companies by delinking China from global tech supply chains.
In the short term, the US blacklist will limit Chinese companies’ access to components from outside the country.
Huawei’s problems with mobile phone chips — over half of which it imports from the US — may strengthen the argument for this militant approach to trade.
Forcing Chinese technology companies into a corner, however, could speed up domestic innovations.
These companies could source products from cheaper markets such as South Korea and produce their own software.
At the most extreme, competing Chinese and US-led internets could emerge — as former Google chairman Eric Schmidt has warned.
An industry body said this week that standards for 5G internet were at risk of this kind of divergence.
That could mean devices produced in one market might be incompatible with those from the other.
This would force countries, and companies, to choose sides in the technological trade war.
Recipients of Chinese funding through programmes such as the Belt and Road Initiative will face a diplomatic balancing act.
Malaysia’s prime minister has said the country would use Huawei’s technology as much as possible.
Powerful US allies including the UK and Germany have come under pressure to ban Huawei.
At least two European telecoms groups, meanwhile, have been reported to be weighing setting up separate units for the eastern and western hemispheres.
Keeping supply chains global does not mean being naive.
Suppliers should be carefully vetted — particularly when there are historical grounds for concern.
But isolating China will not help national security, or remove the economic threat of Chinese tech groups.
Despite its apparent appeal, protectionism is a self-defeating ideology.

Global foreign direct investment has fallen to its lowest level since the financial crisis as richer countries lead the world into a retreat from a “heyday of export-led growth”, according to a UN report.
The 13 per cent drop in worldwide FDI to $1.3tn in 2018 — the third straight year of falls — comes amid rising global protectionism and more US profits being repatriated after the Trump administration’s 2017 tax reform.
Investment from Chinese multinationals also fell for the second year in a row, dropping 18 per cent to $130bn, as a result of state policies to curb overseas investment, as well as growing screening of inward investment in the west.
Mukhisa Kituyi, secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which tracks dealmaking, portfolio and greenfield investment, said: “For some time now, the global policy climate for trade and investment has not been as benign as it was in the heyday of export-led growth and development.”
Last year the number of restrictive policy measures affecting foreign investment was close to a record high, according to Unctad’s annual global investment report.
While only one in 10 policy measures affecting investment was restrictive 16 years ago, by last year that had risen to one in three.
Most of the restrictions introduced last year — 21 of 31 — were in developed countries, while there were substantial increases in 2017 and 2018 in screening processes for FDI.
For example, Germany broadened the definition of critical infrastructure in its investment screening process to include news and media, while the UK lowered the thresholds that trigger investment screening from £70m to £1m in high-tech industries.
By contrast, emerging economies in Asia overwhelmingly adopted measures aimed at the liberalisation, promotion and facilitation of investment.
Unctad’s report also warned that last year about $153bn worth of merger and acquisition deals were blocked or withdrawn for regulatory or political reasons — double the number in 2017.
The drop in investment inflows was geographically uneven, with the largest fall in Europe, influenced by large repatriations of US foreign earnings following tax reforms at the end of 2017.
Disregarding the fluctuations caused by US tax reform and other volatile elements, the FDI trend was “still negative”, according to the report.

Russia has accused the US of striking a “severe blow” to European stability after Donald Trump announced he would send 1,000 troops to Poland, raising fears of a new arms race between the two military superpowers.
Mr Trump’s decision to boost the US military in Poland, which has long sought a bigger Nato presence to deter any threat from Russia, comes just months after his administration pulled out of a landmark cold war nuclear missile treaty drawn up to protect Europe from attack.
Russia’s foreign ministry said yesterday the move was a “severe blow” to a separate 1997 deal between Russia and Nato restricting military build-up in eastern Europe and represented a “further dangerous build-up of military capabilities on the continent”.
The ministry’s statement said Washington had acted “without regard to obligations under multilateral instruments, and now without regard to European allies”.
It added: “Such actions undermine one of the few remaining documents designed to ensure military stability in Europe” and said Russia could not “fail to take this into account in its defence planning and practical activities”.
Moscow has previously warned that any increased Nato presence in Poland could prompt it to increase its own footprint in neighbouring Belarus, its military ally.
The decision to base 1,000 US troops in Poland would complement the 4,500 American forces posted to the eastern European country on a rotating basis.
Mr Trump said the troops would be redeployed from somewhere else in Europe.
“We’d be taking them out of Germany, or would be moving them from another location,” Mr Trump told reporters after a meeting with Polish president Andrzej Duda on Wednesday.
“It would be no additional troops to Europe.”
Speaking in the Oval Office, Mr Trump refused to say if the 1,000 troops would constitute a permanent presence in Poland, a longstanding aspiration of Warsaw.
He also stressed that it was up to Poland to decide how to name the facility, after Mr Duda suggested it should be called “Fort Trump” on a previous visit to Washington.
The troop announcement comes four months after Mr Trump pulled the US out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a bilateral deal signed with the Soviet Union in 1987 that restricted missiles with a range of 500-5,500km and was engineered to protect Europe from nuclear attack.

When Jim Trainor came to the end of an illustrious, 20-year career in the upper echelons of the FBI in 2016, the then 50-year-old had no shortage of options.
Consulting, cyber security companies and start-ups were under consideration.
But he ended up heading to Aon, an insurance broker, where he advises clients on how to deal with their cyber risks.
Mr Trainor said he was attracted to Aon because it was investing heavily in its cyber business.
Getting to grips with the technicalities of insurance was, he admits, “a challenge”.
For insurers and insurance brokers, cyber is big business.
Spooked by attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya in 2017, companies are seeking guidance on how to avoid being attacked, and insurance to cover the costs that arise if they are.
According to analysts at investment bank Jefferies, the global cyber insurance market will grow from $3bn of premiums last year to $7bn by 2020.
Finding enough qualified, experienced people to service that demand is proving hard.
Unlike more established areas of insurance, there is no big pool of talent readily available.
“There are not enough people in cyber who understand all the issues. There is a broad range of skills needed in cyber and no one person would be able to have all of them,” says Mr Trainor. “This is going to be a problem for the next five to 10 years.”
He is not the only public servant who has been persuaded to move to the insurance world.
Jason Hogg, Aon’s head of cyber solutions, also spent time at the FBI.
In the UK, two former directors of electronic surveillance agency GCHQ — Sir Iain Lobban and Robert Hannigan — are cyber security advisers: Sir Iain at Marsh and Ripjar and Mr Hannigan at Hiscox.
“Former FBI agents and government attorneys have the ethos of wanting to help and protect people,” says Mr Hogg. “We see the human impact of data breaches and hacks. It is a compelling story when you are recruiting.”
Elsewhere, UK-based insurer Beazley has recruited from the legal profession, bringing in Raf Sanchez who had been working as a lawyer for investment banks, while other companies, such as AIG, have hired people from the cyber security industry.
The insurers and insurance brokers tend to put these outside specialists into advisory roles.
Mark Camillo, the head of cyber at AIG, says: “When we bring in cyber security people we tend to use them as experts for the underwriters themselves.”
Michael Tanenbaum, executive vice-president at insurer Chubb, says: “We’ve hired lawyers to look at compliance. We’ve hired several attorneys to look at the rules and regulations.”
At Beazley, Mr Sanchez’s role is to support companies when they are attacked, guiding them through what can be a bewildering process at a stressful time.
These services are an important part of the cyber insurance offering.
“You can have people crying down the phone or acting completely irrationally,” Mr Sanchez says. “You need to persuade them what they should be concentrating on, and whether they need to let in outsiders. It’s quite a skill to get that buy-in.”
When it comes to some of the most technical parts of the insurance process, however, insurers usually stick to what they know.
Cyber insurance underwriters — the people who decide which policies to sell and how much to charge for them — tend to have an underwriting background rather than a cyber security or public sector background.
Some of them have moved over from other parts of the business.
“We recently had someone underwriting kidnap and ransom [insurance] who moved into the cyber team because a lot of the risks are similar,” says Mr Camillo.
Joel Westley, a researcher at Eames Partnership, a specialist insurance recruitment firm, says that cyber underwriters often have a background in professional indemnity insurance or liability insurance.
Cyber is also attracting those straight from university.
“On the junior end, when bright graduates are coming in, kidnap and ransom used to be attractive. Now cyber is the sexy market,” says Mr Westley.
The alternative to moving underwriters into cyber from other parts of the business is to poach staff from competitors.
There is a thriving market for qualified, experienced cyber insurance underwriters.
Movers this year include Alex Jomaa, who went from CFC Underwriting to Tokio Marine Kiln in London in February, and Kara Owens, who in March moved to US-based Markel from rival TransRe.
Lateral hires are not cheap.
Mr Westley says that cyber is “one of the best paid markets in insurance”, with cyber insurance underwriters earning about 15 per cent more than underwriters with similar experience in other parts of the industry.
“At the 10-year experience mark — on a £90,000 to £130,000 basic salary — they are scrapping to get to the top, so they move quite a lot,” says Mr Westley. He points out that, as the market evolves, “insurers’ appetites are changing”.
The top cyber insurance underwriters, he says, can earn about £270,000 as a basic salary, with the same again as a bonus and another 70 per cent of the basic as a long-term incentive package.
One entrepreneur has decided to give the experienced underwriters, together with their experienced underwriter salaries, a miss.
Joshua Motta has an impressive CV.
At 14 he was Microsoft’s youngest employee, coding for the software company in his spare time after school.
He went on to stints at the CIA, Sprint, Honeywell, Goldman Sachs and in private equity.
Now 34, he has turned to cyber insurance and, although he admits it has been “a steep learning curve in terms of jargon”, he has created a San Francisco-based start-up called Coalition that is aiming to do things a little differently to more conventional insurers.
Coalition started selling policies in January 2018 and has sold $10m of insurance.
“We’ve probably built the first underwriting company that doesn’t have an underwriter,” says Mr Motta. “We use machines to make decisions, so the underwriters are our software engineers.”
In his view, “it is easier to train a cyber security expert in insurance than it is to train someone who has come out of the insurance world in cyber security”.
Given that his software engineers have maths degrees, he says, they take to the arithmetical concepts behind insurance like “fish to water”.
The result, says Mr Motta, is a company that “looks more like a Silicon Valley start-up than a traditional insurance company”.
At Aon, Mr Trainor is aware of the fight he now has to attract the best tech talent that the cyber security world has to offer.
“[Insurance] is not top of the list because it is less technical,” Mr Trainor says. “Some folk like to be innovative technically. Most people think of [cyber security specialists] Palo Alto Networks or Symantec,” he says.
“My job is to change people’s minds. We are trying to be very innovative. We are trying to be disrupters.”

Between 2016 and 2018, cryptocurrencies produced a bona fide financial bubble.
Nothing typified the madness better than the craze for initial coin offerings meant to fund software projects that promised to revolutionise everything from online gaming to file storage.
Maybe you invested.
More likely, you intuited something was awry when your Uber driver started asking for crypto recommendations and a friend began touting a blockchain-based ledger designed to track marijuana supply chains.
ICOs birthed a thousand millionaires before asset prices plummeted in late 2018, and parts of the sector still thrive.
Now regulators at the US Securities and Exchange Commission are beginning to grapple with the problems caused by these investments through a series of enforcement actions.
So far, the watchdog has focused on bringing ICOs under its traditional regime of disclosure-based investor protection rules.
But my research with David Wishnick into the ICO market reveals some disquieting facts.
The central innovation in ICOs rests on the possibility of using computer code to deliver on contractual promises.
So we surveyed the 50 ICOs that raised the most capital in 2017 and asked a simple question: did the promoters deliver on their promises to protect investors through computer code?
We specifically compared the promises promoters made in their offering documents with the actual function of the cryptoassets they delivered.
We audited each coin’s smart contract, the automated “if this, then that” rules coders design to govern cryptoassets.
We found that most of the offerings promised forms of investor protection that the code did not deliver.
Take the issue of supply.
An investor in a given cryptoasset needs to know that a promoter cannot simply print more, inflating away its value.
In more than 20 per cent of ICOs in our sample where cryptoasset supply restrictions were promised, we could not observe restrictions hard-coded into smart contracts.
More starkly, in 25 of the 36 ICOs where promoters promised to impose restrictions on insiders selling assets and walking away, we could not find those restrictions in the code.
Finally, we found 12 ICOs where the code allowed a central party to modify the way the smart contract worked, but only four of them disclosed that ability in their promotional materials.
Even if the SEC does expand its regulatory umbrella over ICOs, its ability to police against fraud will be limited by resource constraints; and it is not clear that private class-action lawsuits can pick up the slack.
Moreover, these offerings are truly global, allowing promoters to switch jurisdictions, seeking lighter regulation.
That means the market will be largely left to police itself.
But our analysis found no evidence that investors punished firms for failing to put investor protections into code.
Even today, crypto rating agencies look at code only to check that it is protected against hackers.
We found no sign that they tried to match code with investor protections.
That task is left to individual investors, who are expected to read, and understand, smart contracts.
This is a hopeless enterprise.
It is well documented that few people read the click-I-agree user contracts they encounter online, and the same is true for smart ones.
Regulators need to step in.
Here are two simple suggestions.
We should require ICOs to guarantee a match between the key promises made in marketing and code.
Or we should demand that promoters provide plain-English translations of principal code elements.
Such market integrity measures won’t just protect investors, they will also build trust in the asset class itself and enable it to move from a curiosity to something of real economic worth.

Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan has never been about effecting any real change at home.
It’s always been about punishing adversaries — even allies — via tariffs, both real and threatened.
While Mr Trump’s ability to disrupt the status quo is singular, he has no idea how to create a sustainable, long-term growth model for the US.
But a spate of Democratic 2020 candidates, and even some Republicans, have.
They want to Make America Great Again too, via radical shifts in economic thinking that represent a 21st century industrial policy for the US.
Most notable among them is Elizabeth Warren, who last week announced her “plan for economic patriotism”.
That phrase, along with her assertion that “the giant ‘American’ corporations who control our economy . . . have no loyalty or allegiance to America”, sounds like something that could come out of the president’s hawkish economic adviser Peter Navarro’s mouth.
This is a calculated move — Democrats need to win back the red states hit hardest by globalisation.
But unlike the Trump camp, Ms Warren has a theory for how to create sustainable growth.
She points out — correctly — that despite the pushback around state planning, which most Americans view as suspiciously “socialist”, it’s a myth that our government doesn’t make economic choices — they’ve simply made the wrong ones, choosing to support a debt-driven, two-speed economy rather than one that prioritises income and industry.
As she puts it: “America chose to pursue a trade policy that prioritised the interests of capital over the interests of American workers. Germany, for example, chose a different path and participated in international trade while at the same time robustly — and successfully — supporting its domestic industries and its workers.”
Ms Warren believes, as do many conservative hawks, that you can’t compete with China by having an economy dominated by a handful of coastal innovators and hordes of lower-level workers.
You need to make things in order to stay ahead on innovation, particularly when the internet of things and 5G is about to connect software, data and manufacturing in seismic new ways.
Her answer is to create a new “Department of Economic Development”, to “create and defend quality sustainable American jobs”.
It would increase federal funding for core research, making sure that companies that benefit from it then manufacture in the US （particularly if they plan to sell to government）; give taxpayers a cut of corporate profits that come from state funding; and better train the US workforce.
A shift to a worker-led economy, away from a consumer-led economy, defines the plan. Elements are being adopted or mirrored by other liberals like Joe Biden or Kirsten Gillibrand. But most surprising is the way in which Republican Marco Rubio — the senator from Florida who wants to be president someday — has come up with what is in some ways a very similar take on Making America Great. In May, he issued a report, in his capacity as chair of the Senate small business committee, on the challenges to capital investment in America, which crossed a number of red lines for Republicans. The report admitted that the US capital markets had become too self-serving and were no longer helping non-financial business, that prioritising shareholders above all should stop, and that public policy could play a role in directing capital to more productive places — away from Wall Street, and towards Main Street.
It’s a stunning document and says many things, not least that some Republicans are starting to bet on the idea that Trump may not survive his first term — some conservatives spoke out against tariffs on Mexico last week.
The Rubio report reads very much like a potential candidate’s economic manifesto.
But it also proves that even mainstream Republicans are beginning to question the trickle-down orthodoxy.
Made in China 2025, Beijing’s manufacturing strategy, has made it clear to politicians on both sides that the US can no longer successfully compete with state-run capitalism unless it figures out how to funnel capital to the most productive places, connecting the dots between job creators and education.
That’s industrial policy, of course — it’s been a dirty word in the US for decades now.
But it wasn’t always.
As Cornell professor and legal scholar Robert Hockett, who has advised several presidential hopefuls, puts it: “All this represents a return to our own Hamiltonian development model, in which the public sector played a crucial coordinating role, empowering the private sector, and enabling its efforts not to be scattered, haphazard or wasted.”
Alexander Hamilton supported the creation of a national bank, and started a public-private partnership to provide cheap water-power and financial capital to investors in the early Republic.
Subsequent administrations, from Lincoln to Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Kennedy, took pages out of his book.
There will be differences in how Democrats and Republicans read it, particularly when it comes to issues like taxes and how to pay for infrastructure projects.
But the idea that there might be a bipartisan way to Make America Great Again without alienating the rest of the world is the best news I’ve heard in some time.

During his 2016 campaign for the US presidency, Donald Trump courted Indian-American voters by proclaiming he was a “big, big fan” of their ancestral land, which he called an “incredible country” and a “key strategic ally”. Indian-Americans were promised that if Mr Trump was elected, India would have a “true friend” in the White House.
But if Mr Trump considers himself a “true friend” of India, he has a funny way of showing it.
Just a day after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in for a second term after his landslide victory was declared last month, Mr Trump formally stripped India of its preferential access to the US market.
India’s loss of privileges under Washington’s generalised system of preferences — a programme to aid the economies of less developed countries — will hit around $6bn worth of Indian goods previously imported into the US duty-free.
Though not a devastating blow to India — the US imported a total of about $83bn worth of goods and services from India in 2018 — the move is symptomatic of a hardening attitude by Washington towards its putative strategic partner, amid mounting US frustration at the protectionism and unpredictability that make India a notoriously tough market.
“The White House wanted to send a signal to the new government that they are not messing around,” says Milan Vaishnav, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who called the timing of the move “incredibly tone deaf”.
The revocation of India’s special trade privileges also put Mr Modi’s new government on notice that managing its complex relations with the Trump administration, and preventing an escalation of differences, will be one its biggest challenges — with potentially far-reaching consequences for regional security, given the potential risk to the growing defence partnership between the two countries.
Other friction points include the Trump administration’s threat to impose sanctions on India if it purchases oil from Iran — traditionally one of New Delhi’s big suppliers — or it proceeds with its planned acquisition of the Russia’s S-400 missile defence shield.
“If Trump continues down this path, he will take this relationship back by 15 years,” warns Sanjaya Baru, a distinguished fellow at New Delhi’s Institute for Defence Studies & Analysis. “After a long period of distrust, we were able to establish a relationship of trust. But that relationship of trust is now under pressure.
“It’s not about individual policy changes,” Mr Baru said. “The issue really is getting him to understand our concerns. How can you be a strategic partner if you don’t understand our problems?”
The US and India historically had a fraught relationship during the cold war, when New Delhi took a public posture of “non-alignment” while maintaining close ties with Moscow.
But in recent decades, India-US relations have been radically transformed, after the US strategic establishment concluded that a prosperous, militarily strong India could serve as a useful regional counterweight to a rising China.
Today, India is considered a linchpin of Washington’s vaunted Indo-Pacific strategy; defence co-operation is deepening, and New Delhi has acquired around $18bn worth of US military hardware, with other big purchases in the works.
Even as relations have warmed, US companies have expressed persistent exasperation at their difficulties in the Indian market.
But Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Washington did not allow these grievances to overshadow its longer term vision of a stronger defence partnership.
“India is a large democracy that can, given its own interests, serve as a balance to China,” she says. “We have very significant interests in developing a stronger relationship with India. So, we should continue to work on these market-opening issues, but we shouldn’t break the relationship over them.”
But Mr Trump’s obsession with trade deficits has brought a new spotlight to the relatively modest $24bn US trade deficit with India.
At the same time, recent Indian policies — including price caps on medical devices, new data localisation rules, and ecommerce rules that discriminate against foreign players — have incensed powerful US industries.
“Trump measures bilateral relationships in terms of trade deficits and tariffs — it is the way he approaches the world,” says Ms Ayres.
If the revocation of India’s duty-free access to the US market was a warning shot, analysts warn the next move could be for the Trump administration to launch a full-blown investigation into unfair trade practices by India of the kind that provided the legal foundation for Washington’s tariffs on goods from China.
“It’s no secret that they are looking at using tools with various trading partners in ways that they have never [done] before,” said Amy Hariani, vice-president for policy at the US-India Business Council in Washington. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there were people in the administration that were considering that option.”
But Ms Hariani also said that rising trade tensions were not necessarily a “good metric” for the overall health of US-India relations.
“On the defence and strategic side, certainly within the White House, there is a lot of synergy and appetite for our relationship with India,” she said.
But analysts fret that heavy pressure from Washington on economic issues could sap India’s appetite for stronger security co-operation as silos start to break down.
Mr Baru said: “Trump has been hitting more at his friends than at his enemies.”

Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen won her party’s primary for the upcoming presidential election, beating off a challenge from her former premier William Lai.
In telephone polls conducted over the past three days, Ms Tsai garnered 35.7 per cent in an assumed three-way presidential race, while Mr Lai received 27.5 per cent, the Democratic Progressive Party said.
According to the phone polls, conducted by five different pollsters, Ms Tsai would defeat Han Kuo-yu, the mayor of Kaohsiung who is one of the leading contenders for the presidential nomination of the opposition Kuomintang, and Ko Wen-je, the independent Taipei mayor who is also considered a strong potential presidential contender.
The polling results indicate that the president may be benefiting from the mass protests in Hong Kong against the planned extradition law, a political storm that has put the weaknesses of the territory’s “one country two systems” governance model on stark display.
Over the past two years, Ms Tsai’s support had plummeted over a host of unpopular economic and social reforms.
Opinion polls published in the last few months by various Taiwanese media almost consistently showed her trailing Mr Han and Mr Ko.
Ms Tsai’s victory puts her on track to run for re-election in the presidential vote scheduled for next January as candidate of the DPP.
Mr Lai’s announcement in March that he wanted to run, a challenge to a sitting president unprecedented in Taiwan, had triggered months of bitter infighting in the DPP as the party’s more radical pro-independence wing supported him.

“I am my own muse,” purrs Robyn Rihanna Fenty of her new luxury fashion label Fenty, created with the LVMH group, unveiled on Wednesday and now on sale online.
“It’s badass, it’s daring,” she continues.
“It pushes the envelope. It’s confident. It has a strong silhouette. I want everyone to wear it. But I’ve got to make it right for me.”
We have met in Paris, in a nondescript building, down a narrow street in the Marais.
The building has been designated to launch her first “release”, named 5-19, and is clad in a dazzling Fenty-azure blue, but the only clue as to its current occupant is the phalanx of rock-faced heavies who stand around in suits.
This collection, the first under the auspices of LVMH, but actually the fifth if one factors in the four Fenty collections she did when the brand was part of the then Kering-owned Puma, is what she feels like wearing “now”. And it’s unexpectedly smart.
Where her previous collections cited “Marie Antoinette at the gym” or vivid moto-leathers, here are tailored blazers in taupe or pink cotton with bumbag belts attached; a boned shirt has a sculptural, romantic sleeve; Japanese denim jackets and shirt dresses are either designed to cinch the waist and short short short, or voluminous and oversized; a cotton bodysuit has a bustier neckline and a saucy sensibility.
The accessories include stilettos with barely-there straps, chunky gold hoops, and massive metallic visor-style sunglasses.
It’s a wardrobe for someone who wants to be taken seriously, but still wants to feel their vibe.
According to Fenty, fashion was only ever a second interest after music.
Her passion for clothes was fed by her mother Monica, whose style she has always admired.
But, this segue into fashion is merely another platform from which to sell her “sound”.
Excluding the footwear and jewellery — there are as yet no bags — this first release amounts to about 36 different shapes, and items range from about €200 for a corset T-shirt to €1,100 for a reversible coat, price points that are lower than at many LVMH labels but still highly aspirational for the consumers one would imagine sit in her target demographic. Then again, it is size inclusive: clothes run to a French size 46, but the cuts are so generous that they actually run far bigger. “I’m a curvy girl,” she says of the label’s proportions. “And if I can’t wear it, it’s not going to work.”
Watching Rihanna it’s clear to see how the author of eight albums （a ninth is in the works）, with a personal fortune estimated to be about $260m, persuaded Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH and the fourth-richest man in the world, to do her bidding.
Wearing a Fenty mini shirt-dress in white cotton poplin, she gazes out from under a black bouffant of hair like a Ronette remade for the millennial age. Her scarlet-painted talons trace a Barbados-shaped pendant at her neck, one of many references to her birthplace, and strung among a trove of amulets.
But it’s the eyes — catlike, hazel-coloured, lids smeared with an iridescent glow — that hold you.
She has an unnervingly direct gaze, which, combined with her easy candour, and that crazy Cupid’s bow, has a hypnotic effect.
“I’m a control freak,” she says, lightly squeezing my shoulder for emphasis, as she describes a fitting session in the studio. When asked if LVMH were comfortable with the new flexibility she has brought to the maison, she smoulders: “Mr Arnault isn’t stupid.” She may epitomise the laid-back humour of the Caribbean island on which she grew up, but don’t confuse that with complacency. Rihanna works to no one’s schedule but her own.
Actually, the collection is pretty good. For starters, it’s blessedly absent of logos. It’s grown up and womanly, with a femininity undercut with tougher, more masculine looks （later, British Vogue editor Edward Enninful becomes her first male client when he buys a reversible parka in beige and oily black）. But whether or not this Fenty finds commercial favour is less important. This is just the first release.
“I’m designing what I want to wear, for when I want to wear it,” she says of the brand’s roll out, which will see clothes distributed in “drops”, like a cult streetwear brand, and sold direct via the website.
There will be no shows. Not unlike singles on an album, each release will represent completely different attitudes. Today, Riri wants a shirt dress. But next month, she might want a string vest, such as she might wear on holiday. Or an omelette gown, like the spectacular Guo Pei number she wore to the Met Gala in 2015.
If a brand is built on its DNA, Fenty’s defining characteristic will be its changing aesthetic. It will be as mercurial and unexpected as Rihanna is herself. “I don’t want to go to a show and then wait for six months to buy a look in a shop,” she says of dispensing with the business model on which most brands under LVMH have traditionally been dependent. “With Fenty, you see it, you wear it. I’m too greedy to wait.”
Now 31, with more than 71m Instagram followers to her name, Rihanna became one of fashion’s most powerful influencers the day she invited us to stand under her umbrella in 2008.
But while some celebrities know how to work — and sell — a dress, her arrival at LVMH has the potential for real disruption.
She first worked with the group when she starred in a campaign for Dior, for whom she later designed a capsule of eyewear.
When Kering sold Puma, she brought the label to Arnault.
In 2017, she launched Fenty Beauty, an inclusive cosmetic line that now offers make up for 46 shades of skin tone.
That generated more than $500m in retail sales in its first year.
This latest venture combines a further set of firsts.
She’s the first woman of colour to front an LVMH fashion label — “I am an immigrant, of mixed race, and I bring that perspective with me,” she says of her racial identity, which includes black, white and Latin American heritage.
She’s leading the first fashion house LVMH has built from scratch since 1987, not only creatively but in the role of chief executive alongside her managing director, Véronique Gebel, and LVMH chief of strategy Jean Baptiste Voisin.
She’s also the first celebrity to have been given a label at a luxury group that has typically banked on the skills of the couturier.
LVMH have invested €30m in Fenty — and the singer is reciprocating with a similar investment in her time.
Voisin attests that she’s putting in the hours, and that her work ethic is ferocious, but when one of the biggest, most prestigious and successful luxury groups is now putting their money on a singer and not a star designer one wonders if the fate of fashion now rests in the hands of a celebrity?
Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive of LVMH Fashion, who is not directly responsible for Fenty but worked with her at Dior, says that Rihanna is simply an exception.
“She’s not just a celebrity designer,” he says. “[LVMH] know her. We met her years ago at Dior and you could see even then she was above celebrity. She’s super smart. Even at our first meeting she really impressed me. Rihanna is not couture, but she has the talent.”
Even so, having a major global celebrity in the house does offer family Arnault the cachet of modern cool. And a soupçon of mystique. Certainly, the clandestine nature of this first launch has been epic. While the deal was done two years ago, Voisin was so secretive about the label that until very recently only three of his five-member strategy team even knew of the brand’s existence. Those in on the secret referred to the project as “M”, which stands for “Mademoiselle”. （Riri fans will note that early incarnations of the Fenty Beauty line were named “mattemoiselle”.）
Of course, Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel was the first “Mademoiselle”. And according to Voisin, the two share much in common. “Both women with a strong vision,” he says. “Both very smart. Both hard workers. Both powerfully charismatic.”
Is Riri the 21st century’s equivalent of Coco?
The singer has already far exceeded the Chanel founder’s global reach, but the comparison draws some handy parallels.
During her career, Chanel transformed traditional modes of business, designed to suit her own sartorial needs, revolutionised the female wardrobe and made a fortune flogging scent.
More importantly, she marched to no one else’s tune.
Rihanna brings the similarly disruptive point of view, a bold assurance and the calm authority of a woman in absolute control. Even better, she’s devised a creative environment in which she can U-turn any time. If something’s not working, she can just change her mind. And release something else. As a business proposition — it’s LVMH’s most badass move yet.

Extreme weather drove the growth in energy demand last year to its highest level since 2010, triggering warnings of a “vicious cycle” fuelled by reliance on heating and cooling systems that could worsen the world’s carbon emissions crisis.
Energy group BP said in its closely watched annual market review that energy consumption grew 2.9 per cent in 2018, led by China and the US, despite modest economic growth and strengthening oil and gas prices.
The rise spurred a 2 per cent increase in carbon emissions, the fastest since 2011 and equivalent to increasing the global passenger car fleet by a third, or just under 400m.
“If there is a link between the growing levels of carbon in the atmosphere and the types of weather patterns observed in 2018, this would raise the possibility of a worrying vicious cycle,” Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist, said in a speech to launch the report yesterday.
The US saw an unusually high number of very hot or cold days last year, the most since the 1950s.
China and Russia also saw greater fluctuations in temperature in 2018.
Such patterns could cause stronger growth in energy demand and carbon emissions as households and businesses seek to offset the effects, Mr Dale warned.
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect, trapping heat and increasing average global temperatures.
Changes in atmospheric currents linked to climate change are also thought to contribute to extreme cold weather snaps in some areas.
Power generation is the largest source of energy-related emissions, and as the world electrifies and demand for services such as air conditioning grows, the need to clean up the system will intensify.
“It hasn’t been possible to decarbonise the power sector quickly enough to offset the growth in demand,” said Mr Dale, who was former chief economist at the Bank of England.
Climate activists and investors have called on energy companies to take responsibility for their role in global warming, urging them to move into lower carbon businesses.
BP points to the enduring reliance on fossil fuels and said it is aiming to increase output while ultimately reducing emissions.
But the latest statistics show the global energy system is not able to easily break this link as would be necessary to meet the Paris climate agreement goals.
“There are grounds for us to be worried,” Mr Dale said, adding there is a “growing mismatch between hopes and reality”.
According to BP, oil, gas and coal accounted for nearly three-quarters of the growth in energy demand last year, their highest share in five years.
Growth in renewable energy was less pronounced than in previous years but remained the fastest-growing source at 14.5 per cent.
Even as China and India have expanded into cleaner energy sources in recent years, the growth is not enough to meet demand and they are still building coal plants.
Coal saw its second consecutive annual pick-up in demand last year, led by Asia, after three years of declining consumption.
Natural gas demand expanded by 5.3 per cent, one of its strongest growth rates in more than 30 years, fuelled by a continuing switch to gas in China.

They have billions of dollars in funding, backing from China’s biggest tech companies and the world’s largest electric-vehicle market on their doorstep.
But Chinese EV start-ups face a struggle to survive in the face of intensifying competition and subsidy cuts.
Although analysts are reluctant to name companies that could disappear, the two dozen EV start-ups, among them Nio and Xpeng, which have raised more than $10bn in recent years, are expected to be cut down to a handful.
China’s electric vehicle sales have grown tenfold since 2014 and last year it became the first country where new energy vehicles sales surpassed 1m, about three-quarters of which were pure EVs and the rest hybrids.
But that growth has been dependent on subsidies averaging at Rmb70,000 per vehicle, allowing companies to lower prices.
This month, subsidies will be cut to about Rmb25,000 for most vehicles.
That will force companies to raise prices, wiping away one of the main reasons for their sales at a stroke, or accept lower margins on businesses that are already loss making.
The cut is expected to reduce year-on-year growth of EV sales to about 20 per cent in the second half of 2019 compared with 60 per cent in April, as consumers rush to beat the end of subsidies, according to Yale Zhang of Auto Foresight, the consultancy.
BYD, Beijing Auto and Shanghai Auto, the big carmakers, accounted for half of China’s electric vehicle sales last year.
They tend to sell cheap vehicles.
The current top seller, BYD’s Yuan, with a range of 360km, is priced under Rmb99,000.
An imported Tesla Model 3, with a range more than 400km, is priced at Rmb377,000.
More than 15 venture capital-backed EV start-ups brought prototypes to the Shanghai Auto Show this year in the hope that they can win market share by offering higher quality at a premium price compared with currently popular Chinese models.
They include Alibaba-backed Xpeng, which raised $587m in its latest funding round, and WM Motors, which raised $446m in a March round led by Baidu, the internet company, and sold more than 4,000 vehicles in the first quarter.
For Nio, which raised $1bn in a US initial public offering last year and sold more than 11,000 electric SUVs priced around Rmb450,000, the cut in subsidies will mean an increase in its prices by about 10 per cent.
This will put the finances of the lossmaking company under more strain, admits William Li, Nio’s founder.
It reported a $390m total loss in the first quarter of this year, leading it to announce an equity sale to raise $1.5bn from a state-owned fund.
Mr Li warned that it was difficult to market more expensive cars because Chinese consumers were wary of paying high prices.
“There are two major problems: charging infrastructure, and mindset,” he said, referring to the difficulty of making people switch to electric cars. “Consumers need time to change their way of thinking.”
Companies face a tougher fundraising environment. Byton, a start-up founded in 2016 by former BMW executives, accepted funding from FAW, the state-owned carmaker, last month. “Investors are losing their belief in the future of these start-up companies,” said Jochen Siebert, of JSC Automotive, a consultancy. “I don’t see any of them surviving as entities on their own. They will survive as part of state-owned companies.”
Competition from international groups is looming: Tesla is planning production from a Shanghai factory this year, allowing it to lower prices for its Model 3.
Multinationals such as Volkswagen of Germany and General Motors of the US also plan to sell China-made electric cars from the end of next year.
Patrick Yuan, an analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, said: “The foreign brands will come in and become mainstream in China. The start-ups will remain as second-tier EV makers.”
However, preferential policies apart from subsides will still help sales.
Cities in China ration licence plates for petrol vehicles tightly but usually give them away for electric cars.
Growth of ride-hailing apps is also aiding the sector.
Didi Chuxing, China’s Uber equivalent, said it had 400,000 electric cars in its fleet last year and aimed for 1m in 2020, though such platforms tend to favour large companies as they buy in bulk.
This means that sales of electric cars are expected to reach 1.6m this year.
The heads of China’s best known EV start-ups admit many of their peers will face elimination, but argue that they will survive because of the large amount of funds they have raised, while their links with tech companies give them an edge in an era in which cars are becoming more connected.
“When China opened up the passenger vehicle market there were 500 local start-ups,” said Freeman Shen, founder of WM Motors. “It turns out only a few of them became giants . . . Most of them went bankrupt. I think EV start-ups will follow that pattern.”

During a recent interview about the arrest of his daughter, Meng Wanzhou, journalists noticed a telling book on the desk of Huawei Technologies founder Ren Zhengfei.
The book was a Chinese translation of The American Trap, the story of the 2013 arrest by the US Department of Justice of French businessman Frederic Pierucci.
Pierucci, a senior executive at French rail transport company Alstom, was prosecuted and convicted under the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
This law allows the US to pursue corruption cases no matter where in the world the crime took place, as long as the transaction at the core of the investigation was made in US dollars or relevant emails passed through US-based servers.
Pierucci’s story has striking parallels to that of Meng Wanzhou.
Nor are they alone.
Pierucci argues that the US targets companies in strategic industries, including telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas and technology.
If that’s true, then many more Chinese businesspeople could also fall into the American trap and be arrested for alleged crimes that did not take place in the US.
This is a serious risk for high-ranking Chinese entrepreneurs and executives.
There are, however, steps they can take to protect themselves from falling into an “American Trap.”
I devised these strategies a decade ago.
At that time, the Las Vegas casino industry saw online gaming as an existential threat and persuaded American lawmakers to criminalize it.
Given that American residents could easily access international gaming sites, the US claimed the authority no matter where the operating companies were located, even countries where gaming was legal.
In July 2006, the American trap was sprung on David Carruthers, the British CEO of a major, publicly traded British gaming company. He was arrested as he transited through an American airport on his way from the UK to his home in Costa Rica That is when several other on-line gaming companies retained me to legally help protect their company’s executives from the US government’s extra-territorial machinations to maintain its competitive economic edge in gambling.
To illustrate how other Chinese businesspeople might avoid a similar fate, let us go back in time to see what Huawei and Meng Wanzhou could have done differently.
First, Huawei could have ensured it had access to better business intelligence.
Huawei was certainly aware of the heightened rhetoric coming out of the US about alleged unfair business practices.
Targeted intelligence gathering might have alerted Huawei to the threat to executives like Ms. Meng.
Even publicly available information would have pointed to the likelihood that the US had already issued an arrest warrant, or would soon do so.
As far back as 2013, the Reuters news service reported on the Meng case’s central issue, that Huawei and Meng had close ties to Skycom, and that Skycom allegedly tried to sell US equipment to Iran despite US sanctions.
On the basis of this intelligence and an analysis of extradition law around the world, Huawei could have moved onto the second strategy, which is to sort the countries of the world into one of three categories: “red” for off limits, “yellow” for visit with caution, and “green” for safe.
As soon as corporate leadership recognized that the possibility of detention by the US may have become a risk, key executives like Meng should have become very cautious about their movements.
Even if their jobs required extensive business travel, they should have only traveled to countries deemed to fall into the “green” or “yellow” categories.
For as long as the risk persisted, they should not under any circumstances have visited countries in the “red” category, not even to change planes while in transit between two other countries.
The case of Pierucci and his employer Alstom shows that even the largest companies can be extremely vulnerable when a key senior executive is in confinement and the company faces large fines.
Alstom had to pay $722 million as a result of its guilty plea in the case.
It found itself subsequently acceding to a $10 billion takeover that it had previously resisted by the American company General Electric.
The third best-practice strategy is for at-risk executives to obtain passports from second and even third countries and to use these when traveling to protect their identities from the US authorities.
This is not difficult to do, given the variety of citizenship by investment and residency by investment programs now offered by countries around the world.
Meng herself apparently has Canadian residency but not citizenship.
Executives who need still further protection should take an additional step.
They should legally change their name in their countries of second citizenship, so that their second passport bears a name different than the name by which they are known to US authorities.
Legal name changes are common in situations ranging from marriage and divorce to simply not liking your name.
Chinese executives often change their names when operating in countries which are not familiar with Chinese pronunciation.
The process is legal, simple, and inexpensive.
Holding a passport from a second country that also is in a different name makes it more difficult for American authorities to track an executive’s movements.
If they don’t know where she is going, they cannot lay a trap by arranging for her arrest, as they did for Meng in Vancouver.
In Meng’s case, the American authorities were aware before her trip that she would be traveling thru Vancouver on her way back from Mexico.
Their knowledge of her travel gave them an opportunity to lay their trap by informing Canadian officials that they had issued an arrest warrant and requesting her detention.
So far, we have discussed the first three of the best practices that senior Chinese entrepreneurs and executives can use to prevent themselves from falling into an “American trap” and being arrested like Meng or Pierucci.
First, have good intelligence.
Second, know which countries pose a risk.
And, third, obtain a second and possibly a third passport, perhaps in another name.
While this may sound like the stuff of spies and gangsters, all of these steps are entirely legal and above-board.
They are in fact not at all uncommon.
While the first first three strategies should help a worried executive to avoid an arrest or detention, the fourth and final strategy focuses on the team who will go into action when all the other planning has failed and an executive has been arrested overseas.
Just as law enforcement forces use SWAT teams for quick, powerful action in a moment of crisis, executives who fear they may be at risk of unwarranted arrest by a foreign government should have their own “SWAT team” in place in advance.
This team should consist of at least five components.
The SWAT team needs lawyers who are specialists in extradition and criminal law, a public relations expert who can act as the official spokesperson for the defense, someone with good relations with diplomatic officials both in China and in any other country where the detained executive has obtained citizenship, and someone with the authority and the resources to fund the SWAT team’s work and to be prepared to post bond if necessary.
Finally, like all good teams, the SWAT team needs a designated captain.
This advisor ensures that the team members act in a coordinated and strategic manner on behalf of the Chinese company and the detained executive.
Given the current state of geopolitical affairs and the unpredictable manner in which US President Trump in waging the trade war, there are many Chinese companies and executives who should be taking all of these precautions.
Yes, some expense is involved.
In truth, like all insurance policies, these may ultimately prove to not have been needed.
But the cost pales in comparison to the monies that could be required in a detention crisis.
Think what her defense is costing Ms. Weng and Huawei in direct expenses, business disruption, and lost goodwill and opportunities.
As the great Chinese general Sun Tzu writes, “The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.

Home secretary Sajid Javid has called for an end to Theresa May’s tough restrictions on international students who want to stay on in Britain to work after they graduate from UK universities.
Mr Javid argued that the prime minister’s insistence that foreign students can work for no more than six months in the UK after completing their studies undermines Britain’s universities and is harming the country’s search for the best global talent.
“It makes no sense to send some of the brightest and most enterprising people in the world straight home after their time here,” Mr Javid, a contender for the Conservative party leadership, wrote in an opinion article for the Financial Times.
His decision to back a cross-party move to liberalise the student visa regime, led by former Tory universities minister Jo Johnson, is a sign that the government’s vice-like grip on immigration will be eased once Mrs May leaves Downing Street.
Overseas students were allowed to stay and work in the UK for two years after graduation until Mrs May, then home secretary, in 2012 began her crackdown on immigration to try to meet the government’s target of keeping annual net migration to “the tens of thousands”.
The time that students can work after graduating was cut to four months, although the government this year recognised that the new regime was causing problems and agreed to raise the limit to six months.
Mr Javid’s comments received strong support from within the higher education sector, which has long called for eased visa requirements to encourage international students to find work or set up a business after graduating.
Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, the umbrella body for 136 institutions, said such a change in policy would “correct a longstanding policy barrier to growth in international student numbers”.
“Growth in international enrolments in the UK has stagnated compared to our competitors, largely due to the uncompetitive visa offer,” he said. “This must change if we are to . . . remain a leading destination for overseas talent.”
Nick Hillman, head of the Higher Education Policy Institute, a think-tank, said: “This is fantastic news. The home secretary has seen, not least during his time as business secretary, how much harm the current rules are doing. I hope this is one issue on which all the [Conservative party] leadership candidates will agree.”
Mr Javid has already announced plans to axe the net migration target, which has never been met, if he becomes the next Conservative leader and is now also supporting the move to let students stay for longer after they finish at university.
Mr Johnson has forced the pace on the issue, tabling an amendment to the government’s immigration bill — designed to implement a post-Brexit visa regime — that would take students out of the net migration target.
The linked move to allow them to stay for two years is intended to bring Britain closer into line with other nations that have sought-after universities.
Mr Johnson said the US and Canada allowed students to work for three years after graduation.
In Australia the time period is four years.
“It’s high time we recognised the value international students bring to the country and abandoned the welter of harmful policies that are designed to manage numbers down to meet a net migration target,” said Mr Johnson.
The move by Mr Javid is expected to be warmly welcomed by university vice-chancellors, who have argued that the Home Office clampdown made overseas students feel unwelcome.
As a result of the stricter visa regime, the number of Indian students coming to UK universities underwent a dramatic decline, from just under 30,000 in 2011-12 to just over 16,000 in 2016-17.
Mr Johnson’s amendment has the backing of opposition parties and Tory MPs including his brother Boris, the frontrunner in the Tory leadership election, as well as former chancellor Ken Clarke.
Whoever succeeds Mrs May as prime minister is therefore likely to be forced to accept the amendment, if they want to proceed with Brexit legislation to end the free movement of EU citizens.
In his FT article, Mr Javid said he wanted British students and workers to brush shoulders with the brightest talent from around the world as he also sets out plans to raise skills levels across the board.
He said he would broaden the apprenticeship levy into a wider “skills levy”, giving employers the flexibility they need to improve skills in their workforces.

General Motors built its first vehicle powered by hydrogen in 1966.
But instead of revolutionising the auto industry, the GM Electrovan ended up in a museum.
Half a century later, we’re still waiting for hydrogen to live up to its promise as a clean energy technology.
The industry joke is that hydrogen is the fuel of the future — and it always will be.
But that could be wrong.
The huge challenges of climate change as well as the rise of the wind and solar industries are giving it new momentum, attracting fresh interest from governments and businesses well beyond the auto ­industry.
Most hydrogen produced now is not clean, but the technology to change that already exists.
To understand how hydrogen can go from hype to reality it’s important to grasp the situation our energy system faces.
Right now, the world is moving away from the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change that aim to reduce carbon emissions quickly.
To reverse that trend, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar will have to make up a far greater share of global supply, and fast.
But they face difficulties, not least that the amount of electricity they produce can vary depending on the weather or the time of day or year, so it might not be flowing when people need it.
Hydrogen is one of the few ways of storing that variable energy.
Other options include lithium-ion batteries — which power smartphones and electric cars — but they can’t compete with hydrogen in terms of scale.
A big hydrogen storage facility in Texas, for instance, can hold about 1,000 times as much electricity as the world’s largest lithium-ion battery complex, in South Australia.
Clean hydrogen can do a lot more than just fuel cars.
It can power trucks and ships and be a key raw material for refineries, chemical plants and steel mills — all of which now have few alternatives to today’s polluting processes.
Fortunately, these sectors tend to cluster at major industrial ports, offering great opportunities to build combined infrastructure.
And hydrogen is already produced at ports to feed local chemical factories and refineries.
So, hydrogen offers tantalising promises of cleaner industry and emissions-free power: turning it into energy produces only water, not greenhouse gases.
It’s also the most abundant element in the universe.
What’s not to like?
One of the biggest issues is that by far the most common way to produce hydrogen is from fossil fuels.
The amount generated from coal and natural gas this year for industrial uses would be enough, in theory, to power roughly half the cars on the road worldwide.
But hydrogen production releases about the same amount of carbon emissions as the UK and Indonesia economies combined, according to an IEA report to be released next week.
Cleaning up these industries by capturing and storing their carbon emissions or supplying them with hydrogen from renewable sources represents a considerable challenge, but it’s also an opportunity to start building a global clean hydrogen industry for the future.
Another big difficulty is cost.
Hydrogen from renewable electricity is two to three times more expensive than that produced from natural gas.
But solar and wind costs have plummeted in recent years, and if they continue to fall clean hydrogen will become more affordable.
Still, the technology that turns water into hydrogen （without producing carbon emissions） needs to be developed on a much greater scale to cut costs.
Governments will be crucial in determining whether hydrogen succeeds or fails.
Most of the more than 200 projects under way still rely heavily on direct government funding, according to International Energy Agency analysis.
But smart policies should encourage the private sector to secure long-term supplies of clean hydrogen and give investors the incentives to back the best businesses.
We also need to kick-start the international hydrogen trade with the first shipping routes.
There are encouraging signs: Japan has several important pilot projects to figure out the best way to ship hydrogen over long distances.
Meanwhile, the EU has backed an initiative to make hydrogen a significant part of Europe’s efforts to decarbonise its economies.
The IEA will help governments craft the right policies.
At the request of the Japanese presidency of the G20, we have carried out an in-depth study on the state of play of clean hydrogen, recommending immediate practical steps to foster its development.
The report will be released next week at the meeting of the G20 energy ministers.
The world should not miss this unprecedented chance to make hydrogen a serious part of our sustainable energy future, rather than leaving it parked in a museum.

Investors rushed to buy a stake in China’s state-run tobacco monopoly yesterday, pushing shares in the world’s largest cigarette maker’s international unit up 10 per cent in its trading debut on Hong Kong’s stock exchange.
China Tobacco International raised HK$813m （$103m） in an initial public offering, part of the group’s push to sell more cigarettes in international markets as the number of smokers in mainland China begins to decline.
Acting as the international division of China National Tobacco, the unit buys leaves from countries such as Brazil and the US for its parent company, and has exclusive rights to sell Chinese-made cigarettes at duty free stores in several Asian territories.
Shares in the unit, which reported a net profit of HK$259.5m last year on revenues of HK$7bn, rose more than 10 per cent in early trading.
Its top shareholders were not immediately disclosed.
China National Tobacco has a stranglehold on the Chinese cigarette market, with an estimated 97 per cent market share according to research firm Euromonitor.
It is a significant tax contributor, accounting for about 6 per cent of China’s $2.7tn of government revenues last year, making it a powerful lobbying group.
However, the company has been seeking to broaden its presence in international markets amid efforts by Chinese health officials to curb smoking in a country where more than a quarter of the adult population are regular tobacco users.
China’s smoking rate saw its first decline last year to 26.6 per cent of the adult population — some 308m people — from 27.7 per cent in 2015, as awareness of the activity’s negative health effects grows, according to the World Health Organization.
China exported cigarettes worth $722m last year, according to customs data, up from $248m a decade ago, with the majority heading to developing countries in Asia.
The global push has Beijing’s backing, with the government calling for China Tobacco’s international competitiveness to be “comprehensively” enhanced.
Last year, the company designated the unit, China Tobacco International, as the “international business expansion platform of the PRC tobacco industry”, according to its IPO filing.
CICC and China Merchants Securities were bookrunners for the IPO.

Why is ‘cracking seven’ a big deal for China’s currency?
If China’s renminbi slips past Rmb7 a dollar — “cracking seven” in trader talk — it would take the currency to a level of weakness not seen since the depths of the global financial crisis 11 years ago.
It would also breach a widely recognised floor that China’s central bank has previously defended during bouts of sharp depreciation last year and in 2016.
The defence mounted in 2016, in which China was forced to burn through some of its foreign exchange reserves, spending as much as $107bn in a single month, followed a shock devaluation from the previous August that marked the currency’s biggest one-day drop in decades.
While it delivered a shot in the arm to the country’s export-led economy, it spurred substantial capital outflows and drew accusations of currency manipulation from critics in Washington and put it under regular scrutiny from the US Treasury Department.
Fast forward to this year, and following a tumble in early May after US president Donald Trump threatened higher duties on Chinese goods as part of the 11 month-long Sino-US trade dispute, the renminbi has largely halted its fall in the lead-up to the G20 summit in Osaka at the end of this month. The meeting is probably the final chance for the two countries’ leaders to thrash out a deal that would avoid the US levying 25 per cent tariffs on virtually all goods imported from China.
How does China manage the renminbi?
Since 2015 the onshore renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to move 2 per cent in either direction of a daily trading band midpoint set each morning by the People’s Bank of China.
When Mr Trump threatened higher tariffs in May, the midpoint soon softened enough to push the weak end of the trading band past Rmb7 per dollar, where it remains, ostensibly permitting the currency to fall past the threshold at a moment’s notice.
Beijing also permits a smaller pool of the currency to trade in Hong Kong, part of a drive to internationalise the renminbi.
The offshore exchange rate is not limited by the trading band and is therefore subject to the sway of international market forces.
But while a gap between the two rates has opened in recent weeks there is far less daylight between them now than was seen following the shock devaluation in 2015.
On Tuesday the PBoC announced it would issue renminbi debt in Hong Kong, prompting speculation it was seeking to sop up liquidity there and defend the currency by making it more difficult for international investors to bet against.
But Mansoor Mohi-uddin, senior macro strategist at NatWest Markets, said this was unlikely to have been the main goal of the issuance, since onshore demand for the dollar in China was probably driving markets, rather than offshore short selling.
What does the Trump administration think?
The US Treasury Department again declined to label China a currency manipulator last month, although it expressed “significant” concerns over the exchange rate, then closer to the seven level than at any point since 2008.
But on Saturday, at a meeting of financial ministers and central bank governors in Osaka, ahead of the G20 meeting, US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared to suggest that a failure to intervene could itself be viewed as a sort of manipulation.
“Sometimes if the market expects intervention and you’ve been intervening for a long time to support a currency, and you don’t intervene, that could also have a big market impact,” he said.
Is seven a matter of if, or when?
Although the renminbi hit a six-month low against the dollar on Monday, many strategists are sceptical it will crack seven before the G20 and on Tuesday the onshore rate was 0.2 per cent firmer at Rmb6.913 a dollar.
Christy Tan, head of markets strategy and research for Asia at NAB, said the PBoC was unlikely to use devaluation as its weapon of choice when dealing with trade issues.
The central bank has not forgotten the hard lessons learnt from the capital outflows and international criticism it weathered in 2015.
But she added that if no deal was struck at G20 and Mr Trump did go all-out with 25 per cent tariffs on the remaining $300bn in Chinese imports, “seven will break through in very short order”.
Recent comments from Chinese officials have laid the groundwork for that, downplaying the importance of the seven threshold. On Friday central bank governor Yi Gang said no hard limit existed for the dollar exchange rate. “I don’t think this is an important question,” Mr Yi said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “I don’t think along the mathematical scale any one number is more important than the other number,” he added.
Mr Yi’s attention is arguably focused elsewhere.
Homin Lee, Asia macro strategist at Lombard Odier, said that the key lower bound for the renminbi was not seven per dollar, but rather 92 — that is, the implicit lower bound for the CFETS Renminbi index, which measures the currency against a basket of peers.
The latest weekly reading for the gauge left a bit of breathing room yet at just over 93.
“They have already shown willingness to defend this implicit lower bound, and if they remove that lower bound . . .  then there’s no obvious anchor for the markets,” Mr Lee said.

Would you trust Amazon to manage your life savings?
In China, 588m people have put faith in an ecommerce group to find higher yields.
Alibaba, which runs the world’s largest money market fund, has transformed asset management in China.
Its affiliate Ant Financial has its sights on repeating this success through a joint venture with US-based Vanguard Group.
The Shanghai subsidiary of the world’s largest mutual fund group will hold a 49 per cent stake in the partnership, with Ant taking the rest.
Through Alibaba’s mobile payment service Alipay, Ant has access to 700m active users in China that keep $168bn in Ant’s funds.
Vanguard will have arrived at the right time.
Regulators have started opening China’s mutual fund market to allow foreign asset managers to own up to 51 per cent of Chinese fund joint ventures.
Before, majority foreign-owned asset managers could not sell funds to local retail investors.
JPMorgan is expected to be the first.
Vanguard could follow suit later.
Money market funds make up half of all mutual funds in China.
Yields here once exceeded 6 per cent.
Monetary easing has reduced these to around 3 per cent.
Consumers seeking higher yields are hunting online for riskier products, including equity funds.
They represent a ready market for Vanguard’s passive portfolios and ETFs.
Another area of potential is robo-advice, using mathematical models.
A fifth of Ant’s fund customers live in the countryside.
Making investing simpler while removing banks as middlemen are two reasons for its success.
Vanguard has continued building out its robo-advisory business since its launch four years ago.
At Ant Financial, more than a third of its revenues come from fund transaction fees.
Taking a bigger slice of the asset management market should increase its $150bn private valuation.
Most savings in China are held in bank deposits.
Its mutual fund market is young and open to disruption.
Trust Ant and Vanguard to become formidable partners.

Donald Trump on Tuesday praised Chinese president Xi Jinping as a “terrific” leader, but said he would only agree to a trade agreement with China if both sides reached a “fair deal”.
Speaking at the launch of his 2020 re-election campaign, Mr Trump suggested he was not desperate to secure a deal to end the Sino-US trade war as the two leaders prepared to hold talks at the G20 summit in Japan this month.
“I spoke to President Xi . . . this morning at length,” Mr Trump said in Florida.
“We’ll see what happens. But we’re either going to have a good deal and a fair deal or we’re not going to have a deal at all and that’s okay too.”
Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Trump tweeted that the two leaders had agreed to meet in Osaka at the end of June.
A Chinese official confirmed to the Financial Times that Mr Xi had agreed to meet the US president.
Mr Trump had previously suggested that the leaders would meet at the G20 but the White House had not clarified if they would have a bilateral discussion.
Talks between the two sides collapsed at the last minute last month with each side accusing the other of trying to change the terms of the deal at the eleventh hour.
Since then the trade dispute has widened into a tech war, with the US placing Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei on a commercial blacklist.

Consumer prices in China rose at the fastest pace in 15 months in May as pork prices jumped further after farmers were forced to cull hogs amid a countrywide  outbreak of African swine fever.
Consumer prices rose 2.7 per cent year on year in May, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, quickening from the 2.5 per cent increase in the previous month.
The rise was in line with estimates from economists polled by Reuters.
Pork prices, a major component of the index, rose 18.2 per cent with food prices rising 7.7 per cent.
More than 1m pigs have been culled since the first case of the swine fever was logged in August, the ministry of agriculture said, pushing up the cost of the popular meat.
In month-on-month terms, prices were unchanged, as forecast by economists.
The bureau said demand for pork was weaker thanks to warmer weather and other effects, with prices down 0.3 per cent.
Growth in producer prices slowed to 0.6 per cent, from 0.9 per cent in the previous month.
That reading also met forecasts.

Hong Kong postponed debate of a controversial extradition bill on Wednesday morning after thousands of protesters occupied key roads near the government’s offices demanding a withdrawal of the law that critics say will allow China to extradite whoever they want from the territory.
The chairman of Hong Kong’s legislature announced on Tuesday that the bill, which was supposed to start being debated on Wednesday, would go to a final vote on June 20, much earlier than expected. The debate has now been delayed until further notice, according to local radio station RTHK.
“It’s not a success,” said a 30-year-old protester in reaction to the news of the delay, adding that the government could reschedule the debate for any time.
Demonstrators wearing face masks occupied Harcourt Road and Lung Wo on either side of the government offices during morning rush hour.
Drivers said they had been stuck in traffic for hours, with most adding they sympathised with the protesters.
Both routes had been blocked during the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests, which called for universal suffrage.
The government was forced to issue a statement early on Wednesday saying all access roads to its central offices had been blocked and advised staff not to drive into work and to be mindful of their safety.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.2 per cent in morning trade.
“The government wants this bill to pass as soon as possible to prevent further escalation of the protests which have already been very large,” said Samson Yuen, a political scientist at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.
The attempt to rush through the bill “really breaks the deliberative tradition of legislation in Hong Kong because even for any bill not as important as this one, it usually takes weeks or months to debate”, he said.
The city’s police force was out in force in anticipation of the crowds after students and small businesses said they would strike on Wednesday with calls to “picnic” in a park at the central government offices in opposition to the bill which would allow individuals to be sent to China to stand trial.
A 30-year-old swimming coach, Ben, wearing safety googles and a mask said “I came out for the next generation . . . to keep Hong Kong safe for them.”
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s leader, has vowed to push ahead with the bill, despite an estimated 1m taking to the streets on Sunday to oppose the plan.
The “one country, two systems” framework agreed at Hong Kong’s handover from UK to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 was meant to protect Hong Kong’s civil liberties for 50 years.
The territory does not have an extradition agreement with China.
The US state department expressed its “ grave concern” over the bill on Monday, saying the proposal put the Hong Kong’s special status at risk.

Alibaba looks set to pull off another coup.
If the stars align — and with rocky markets, that is far from a given — the China tech giant that executed the world’s biggest flotation will notch up another marquee deal with its planned secondary listing in Hong Kong.
The genius with this deal is that it plays to a host of constituents.
The $25bn New York listing in 2014 rewarded investors （shares are up roughly 2.5 times）, investment bankers （a $250m fee pool） and founders.
But it left the spurned Hong Kong stock exchange miffed and Beijing chafing at its best and brightest going west.
This time, the bounty will spread much further.
Beijing gets one of its stars back closer to home turf; Hong Kong’s exchange snags a mega-deal; and investors stand to gain again if the move delivers a valuation fillip on the more generously priced Hong Kong stock exchange.
It has been timed to perfection.
With the ever broadening tech war rippling out to the capital markets, Alibaba— with a market capitalisation of $416bn — is reminding Washington that greater China is perfectly capable of providing financing too.
That fits neatly with the current mantra of self-sufficiency and delivers on Beijing’s long-cherished aim of bringing its tech giants home.
Previous efforts have largely fallen flat.
An attempt to launch Chinese Depositary Receipts fell flat on its face: the likes of Alibaba balked at acquiescing to mainland rules including market-phobic metrics for price setting.
But by planting a flag for Team China, Alibaba is doing its bit to show when it comes to capital market it need not rely purely on New York for financing.
Semiconductor maker SMIC helped underline the point by withdrawing its own （thinly traded） New York listing the week before.
For Alibaba that is a fairly cheap way of banking credit with China.
It could use the credit: talk of friction between its shoot-from-the-hip founder Jack Ma and China’s leadership never quite dies, and there is the irksome business of its mooted acquisition of a stake in affiliate Ant Financial still awaiting approval.
It need not cost investors much either.
At $20bn, the listing would dilute existing shareholders by about 5 per cent.
But Alibaba doesn’t need the money.
It is a prodigious cash machine, with Rmb104bn （$15bn） of free cash flow last fiscal year.
Instead, the smart move would be to buy shares back, neutering the new issuance.
Serendipitously, there are plenty of ways to do so.
Altaba, the Yahoo carve-out housing the group’s investment stakes, is liquidating its Alibaba stake.
SoftBank, owner of 25.9 per cent, has already pared off some of its Alibaba holding.
Alibaba itself is in the midst of a $6bn buyback programme.
Even some founders may put their hands up.
Last fiscal year, Mr Ma trimmed his stake from 6.4 to 6.2 per cent while Joe Tsai, executive chairman, cut his from 2.3 to 2.2 per cent, according to the group’s latest SEC filing.
Assuming no dilution, investors may even look forward to a boost to their holdings.
Hong Kong investors tend to value their companies more generously than their US peers.
Alibaba, which trades on 23 times forecast earnings, sadly lags its Hong Kong-listed rival Tencent’s 31 times forward multiple, based on Bloomberg numbers.
Analysts attribute this to local investors’ supposedly superior knowledge.
Alibaba and Tencent are huge companies but they are terribly domestic.
An investor in Hong Kong is likely to shop on Alibaba’s Taobao platform and pay with Alipay — or at least know someone who does.
The same is unlikely to be true in the US.
Whether or not the reasoning is correct, the evidence is there.
Lossmaking entities such as Alibaba Health trade at 200 times next year’s putative earnings, according to Bloomberg estimates; Alibaba Pictures, 72 times.
Still, what may be good for Alibaba and pleasing to Beijing does not hide the fact that Hong Kong is far from replacing the US as a source of capital.
The total market capitalisation on the Hong Kong stock exchange is roughly one-seventh that of New York and Nasdaq combined.
Average daily turnover last year was just 14 per cent of the New York due.
Besides, Tencent owes at least part of its more generous valuation to scarcity value.
If Alibaba — as some bankers and party faithful hope — heralds a wave of secondary listings from the US, that will not last long.

There has been lots of talk lately （including by me） about how unhappy and divided the UK is.
The vote for Brexit is often described as a cry of pain from suffering people.
So I was stunned to see the chart reprinted below, which comes from the independent Resolution Foundation think-tank and shows that self-reported British life satisfaction is the highest since surveys began in the 1970s.
About 93 per cent of Britons now say they are “fairly” or “very” satisfied with their lives.
Resolution reports “a very marked upward drift” since 2000, despite stagnating satisfaction during the financial crisis and since the referendum. Academic experts tell me they believe these findings. Nancy Hey, director of the What Works Centre for Wellbeing, says that, contrary to Britain’s doom-ridden national debate: “For most people, things have been getting gently better.” What is going on?
First, a caveat: not everyone is satisfied.
About 500,000 Britons — many in poor health, disabled or doing unpaid care work — report low wellbeing across all measures, says Hey.
Homeless people suffer too but aren’t captured by Eurobarometer’s surveys or by the UK’s Office for National Statistics’ equally positive studies of wellbeing since 2011.
Associating pockets of unhappiness with the vote for Brexit is tricky.
True, the poor Leave-voting areas of Wolverhampton, Knowsley and Oldham have the country’s lowest average wellbeing.
However, Remain-supporting London, often derided as a blissful elite bubble, has the lowest self-reported wellbeing of any region, says Resolution.
Meanwhile, retired homeowners aged about 70 — overwhelmingly pro-Brexit — are the UK’s most satisfied citizens.
For this particular group, the Leave vote was less a cry of pain than a vote of confidence by very contented people in the country’s ability to go it alone.
When you ask why most Britons are content, happiness researchers often start by pointing to jobs.
About the worst thing for personal life satisfaction is unemployment.
Seventy-six per cent of working-age Britons are in work, the highest rate on record.
Admittedly, wages have stagnated and many people have unfulfilling jobs.
Still, unfulfilling jobs aren’t new, and any job is better than none.
Much maligned as the gig economy is, its workers seem to experience “strong positive effects on mental health”, possibly because they gain more control of their time, report Bénédicte Apouey of France’s National Centre for Scientific Research and Mark Stabile of Insead business school.
Improved physical health has boosted British happiness too.
But then we get to intangibles.
A strong predictor of national happiness is the share of people agreeing with the statement, “In this country, I am satisfied with my freedom to choose what I do with my life,” says Luisa Corrado of the University of Rome Tor Vergata.
Women and sexual minorities — ie most of the population — have increasingly gained such freedom.
That may help explain the EU-wide rise in happiness, suggests Corrado.
Twenty-seven of 31 countries with Eurobarometer data covering more than a decade report increased subjective wellbeing.
（Self-reported wellbeing has fallen in the US, possibly due to rising inequality, says Corrado.
Society’s growing emotional literacy also helps. I see this in my own family. In 1940, my grandmother lost a son to disease — an everyday tragedy at the time. Weeks after his death, his teacher wrote to her: “I trust that time is gradually dulling the terrible blow . . . Needless to say, I miss Julius and his ‘willing hands’ about the classroom.” My other grandmother lost a son in an accident. I don’t think either talked about her grief. The stiff upper lip froze unhappiness in place.
Nowadays it’s easier for people to talk about grief, depression, anxiety or loneliness.
That may have helped push the UK’s male suicide rate to the lowest level on record.
True, mental-health services are overstretched, but Hey says that support from friends and family often matters more.
There’s a widespread presumption that British social trust has declined.
But, in fact, the proportion of those saying that “people can almost always or usually be trusted has remained relatively stable （at about 45 per cent） between 1998 and 2014”, reports the National Centre for Social Research, drawing on the large-scale British Social Attitudes studies.
In 2017, the figure jumped to 54 per cent.
The more specific rising British distrust of politicians and journalists may count for less than whether people have someone to collect them from hospital, and safe streets to walk down.
Crucially, violent crime （probably including domestic abuse） has declined since the 1990s.
Perceived corruption remains relatively low in the UK.
Since the referendum, self-reported British subjective wellbeing has stagnated, finds a study led by Georgios Kavetsos of Queen Mary University of London.
Pro-Europeans are predictably upset, but even anti-Europeans saw an early rise in wellbeing melt away, perhaps because Brexit hasn’t been delivered.
Even so, British contentment remains about the highest ever measured.
As usual, nostalgia is misplaced.

Huawei, the Chinese company at the centre of the US-China tech storm, is working with European, Japanese and Chinese car groups to launch self-driving vehicles as early as 2021 as it seeks to move beyond the telecoms equipment industry to embrace a broader range of artificial intelligence products.
Dang Wenshuan, Huawei’s chief strategy architect, told the Financial Times that Huawei was providing the AI backbone in several co-operative ventures including one with Audi, which is owned by Germany’s Volkswagen, and the Chinese manufacturers GAC Group, Beijing New Energy Automobile and Changan Automobile.
“From my understanding, we are working together to have a car that will be shipped in the year 2021 or 2022 using these [autonomous driving] components,” Mr Dang said.
“But not only in China . . . it will also be in Europe.”
Mr Dang said that China would be at the forefront of the global autonomous vehicle industry because of the size and dynamism of its market.
Asked which of Huawei’s partners would be first to market with a road-ready car, he said: “In terms of moving to a connected car, or an autonomous driving car, the Chinese car manufacturers are moving even faster.”
The business operations of Huawei, the world’s largest telecoms equipment company, are under severe pressure following Washington’s move to add it to its “entity list”, which in effect bars US companies from selling components to it and 68 of its affiliates.
The impact of the ban, which is set to come into force in mid-August, is likely to be felt in the critical areas of cyber security and semiconductors, but Huawei executives said the work on developing self-driving vehicle technology was set to proceed regardless.
In a video shown to the FT, an Audi car drove around Shanghai obeying traffic signals and avoiding pedestrians and scooters in what appeared to be an uncontrolled environment.
A person sat in the driving seat but did not touch the steering wheel or controls.
However, Tu Le, managing director at advisory firm Sino Auto Insights, said the US blacklisting would hamper Huawei’s prospects since much of the technology was from the US.
The capabilities of autonomous vehicles, which navigate by using sensors to feed images of road conditions back to a central computing system in the car, are divided into levels one to five. Level five — in which a vehicle can do without a driver altogether — “will never happen”, according to Mr Dang. Manufacturers such as Huawei are focused on achieving Level four, such as the Audi prototype in the video.
Several Chinese internet companies, including Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, are developing self-driving vehicles with different partners, but the Chinese companies have so far been seen as lagging behind Google subsidiary Waymo, which launched a self-driving robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona last year.
However, Huawei is expecting China’s mass market to carry domestic manufacturers forward following launch in 2021.
Globally, the autonomous vehicle market is set to grow from $54.23bn in 2019 to $556.67bn in 2026, according to Allied Market Research estimates.
The Chinese government has provided strong support for autonomous vehicles as part of a broader push to gain global leadership in artificial intelligence.

It has been quite a week for Adam Koszary. His quirky digital campaign for the previously obscure Museum of English Rural Life won a Gold Muse Award from the American Alliance of Museums. Hours after he tweeted his delight, the 28-year-old posted that he was no longer going to join London’s Royal Academy, but would move to a quite different role: social media manager at Tesla, the carmaker headed by the mercurial Elon Musk. As career pivots go, this is a handbrake turn.
Mr Koszary’s job prospects took off like a SpaceX rocket last year after he posted a black-and-white picture of a huge ram from the Merl’s archive on Twitter with the message “look at this absolute unit”.
The post gave new life to an old meme and last month attracted Mr Musk’s attention.
A banterous back-and-forth on the social media channel culminated in the entrepreneur using the ram as his profile picture.
Mr Koszary briefly recast the Merl account as “The Muskeum of Elonglish Rural Life”.
How this virtual — and, for non-users of Twitter, baffling — flirtation blossomed into a job offer is unclear.
Neither Mr Koszary nor Tesla has commented, though the RA sustained the light-hearted tone, wishing its un-recruit well, joking about a deal to deliver an “RA-branded Model S” car, and re-advertising the £33,000-a-year job he had turned down.
The consensus from his admiring fans seemed to be that this was a job offer Mr Koszary could not refuse, but there were also a few warnings that he should be careful what he wishes for.
It is one thing dealing with Mr Musk at a distance, quite another working closely with the technology impresario and his lawyers as they navigate a restrictive agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission about the entrepreneur’s freedom to tweet.
Sheep memes unite; online speculation about Tesla and its future tends to divide.
Career gurus like to advise people to aim high and never look back, on the assumption “passion” and drive will eventually yield the dream job. This is a misleadingly linear narrative, distorted by survivor bias. It ignores those who leapt and fell, and includes too many fairy tales of talent spotted and rewarded. It omits entirely the important and slow process of trial and error as any career evolves.
My standard career advice has long been to adopt an “EasyJet approach”, after the low-cost airline.
If you fixate only on one possible destination and time of arrival you are likely to pay a high price to get there, and may not even get a seat.
The more flexible you are about offers and opportunities, the more likely you are to arrive.
Mr Koszary’s story offers some good examples of how to navigate the early twists in any job history.
First, ensure you are in the right state of mind.
Mr Koszary was already committed to leave the Merl and jump to a bigger job.
Once he had decided to move, it was easier to consider other opportunities when they came up.
The fact he left of his own accord also sets him up to enjoy the new job more.
Managers and workers experience a “honeymoon-hangover effect” after changing jobs.
Their satisfaction peaks in the new role and then declines.
One study suggests only those who leave voluntarily end up more satisfied than they were at their old employer.
Second, ride your success.
Mr Koszary already has a website and blog dedicated to “fun, effective social media” and offers talks and workshops.
He is a fledgling expert in museum communications rather than in Tesla’s domain of electric vehicles and clean energy.
But he has built a strong launch pad from which to blast off — and one to which he can return if the Tesla job does not work out.
Third, know what you are getting into. The Tesla role may offer Mr Koszary less leeway to post memes than the job he is leaving. But he is no innocent. In a blog post about “swapping souls with Elon Musk”, he described how the Merl started receiving “messages from people asking for jobs, for money to help their starving families, and for free Teslas . . . It was a terrifying glimpse of the amount of noise celebrities attract on Twitter, and I don’t know how they cope”. He may be about to find out.
There will be times at Tesla when Mr Koszary wistfully dreams of digital sheep and the freedoms he enjoyed at a small museum in middle England.
But he has already proved the point of a new survey by Harvard Business School and Boston Consulting Group.
It suggests business leaders think fear of significant change is the main factor that stops staff preparing for the uncertain future of work.
Yet when asked who was responsible for getting ready for that future, employees in most countries polled said they bore more responsibility than their government or employer.
In this world of self-reliance, it probably helps if you are yourself an absolute unit.

Taobao, China’s largest online marketplace, is offering consumers the chance to buy not just a tube of toothpaste, but the entire company behind it.
Tianqi, the well-known toothpaste brand, and Guangxi Aoqili, its manufacturer, went on sale yesterday for a starting price of Rmb163m （$23.6m）, becoming one of the first household-name brands to be auctioned on the site.
The auction, which closes today, also included industrial real estate, production equipment for making toothpaste and 57 trademarks related to Tianqi, according to a notice posted on the auction website.
Separately, shoppers can still buy Tianqi toothpaste on Taobao’s sites for less than $2 per tube.
The reasons for the online sale of the private company are not known.
Taobao is controlled by ecommerce company Alibaba and processes tens of millions of retail sales for Chinese consumers every day.
It is also famous for its annual “singles’ day” event on November 11, when tens of billions of dollars of goods are sold.
But the company also runs an auction site for property confiscated by Chinese courts.
In recent years it has become a platform for hawking everything from parcels of forest land to tea tables made from precious wood.
Two Boeing jets and an unfinished skyscraper went on the block last year.
The marketplace also offers up shares in banks and insurance companies.
Bad-debt managers have started using the site to offload their portfolios.
An FT investigation into the auction site in 2018 found that it had become a billion-dollar marketplace for shares in banks, both listed and unlisted, raising questions over how such financial assets are priced and regulated.
Foreign banks have even used the platform to snap up shares in Chinese financial companies.
In April, Morgan Stanley made an online purchase of a 5.5 per cent stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Fund Management for about Rmb25m, making it the largest shareholder in the business it helped set up.
Controlling stakes in small companies are regularly for sale on Taobao but the Tianqi auction was a rare opportunity to buy a nationally recognised brand.

Brokerage Huatai Securities said on Tuesday it seeks to raise as much as $2bn when it becomes the first Chinese company to list in London as part of a new link between the two market centres.
The Nanjing-based company, one of the biggest brokerages in China, said on Tuesday each global depositary receipt be priced between $20 and $24.5. The offer period is set to begin on Tuesday and will end on Friday, with a maximum 82.5m GDRs up for grabs.
Including the full exercise of the overallotment option, the sale is expected to raise between $1.7bn and $2.02bn and the number of GDRs will represent about 10 per cent of the company’s outstanding share capital.
The sale will make the financial group the first company to take advantage of a link between the London Stock Exchange and a Chinese bourse.
The offer price and number of GDRs to be sold will be determined on or around June 14, the company said in a statement on Tuesday, with “conditional dealings” in London expected to begin on or around June 17.
JPMorgan, Huatai Financial Holdings in Hong Kong, and Morgan Stanley are the joint global co-ordinators and bookrunners of the sale.
HSBC Bank and Credit Suisse are also involved.
“Huatai will offer international investors exposure to China’s financial services market, which has grown strongly as personal wealth has rapidly accumulated and capital markets have developed,” said Zhou Yi, chairman and president of the brokerage.
The GDRs are expected to list on the standard part of the LSE and to trade on the Shanghai-London Stock Connect segment of the main market.
Trade is expected to begin on or around June 20.

Most people you fly with are unmemorable.
They sit down, strap in and get on with whatever it is they do to pass the hours in the air.
Unless they become overly drunk or aggressive — which I have read about but never seen — there is no reason to think of them again.
I’m sure they feel the same about me.
But as you fly, you begin to notice common quirks and behaviour that some passengers engage in.
These groups make up flying’s mini-tribes.
Here are some I have noticed.
1. Mr IT Department This is the passenger who, the instant the seatbelt sign pings off, pulls down his table and sets out his stall. A laptop, a tablet to plug into the laptop, a phone, or even two, to plug into those, and then a set of wireless headphones clamped on his ears, the blue light flashing. He now goes about his task with calm purposefulness: a click here, a shift of handset there. What is he doing with all this computing power? Is he monitoring the situation below, ready to step in from 35,000ft if the Pentagon or GCHQ go down?
2. Ms Wolf-at-the-Door This passenger also takes out her laptop and flips open the lid the moment we are airborne.
That is the last time she raises her head.
She hammers away at her keyboard throughout the entire flight.
Spreadsheets, bar charts and wodges of text appear, are clicked away, are returned to and revised.
What on earth is going on? This is not a PowerPoint presentation she is preparing. It is too frenetic for that. Something momentous clearly awaits her on landing. Administration or Chapter 11 is imminent; possibly a hostile bid that needs repulsing.
All offers of food are waved away.
The only refreshment she accepts is a stiff drink, from which, pausing momentarily from her critical task, she takes a sharp, urgent sip.
3. The Night Watch When it’s black outside, the blinds are down and the cabin lights are off, most of the passengers lie comatose.
Sprawled across seats, blankets under seat belts, eye masks across faces, they are oblivious to the world.
Some have their mouths laxly open, a few are snoring.
But a handful of passengers are awake: watching movies, reading in a needle of light or stalking the aisles and enjoying the odd stretch.
There is an unspoken recognition among them: they are the ones who cannot sleep, and who do not understand all those who find it so easy.
Every few hours, kind cabin crew members appear among the Night Watch, wordlessly proffering trays with plastic glasses of water or orange juice.
Of all flying’s mini-tribes, I know this one best, as I am one of its longest-standing （or reading, or film-watching） members.
4. Wonder Bladder These are the travellers who settle into a window seat, turn their faces away, curl up and go to sleep, which is how they stay until it is time to land.
But their flight-long sleeping is not the most remarkable thing about them.
No: it is the fact that not once, on an eight-hour flight, do they ever get up to go to the toilet.
They truly are marvels of nature.
When the crew wake them up with an order to return their seats to the upright position as we prepare for landing, they look a little disheveled and grumbly. They are all young, of course, but they really shouldn’t be so cross. They will discover, as the decades pass, that they will be wandering down the aisle to join the toilet queue more often than they can currently imagine.

At Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Mellon University, students at the Tepper School of Business are eating lunch in the expansive dining area of the new $201m campus building
In a small seminar room upstairs, 30 MBA students have gathered to discuss What We Lose, a novel by an African-American author, Zinzi Clemmons, who grew up in Pennsylvania. This is the Tepper Reads book club, created to help its students — many of whom hope to be future business leaders — better empathise with people from backgrounds very different to their own.
Tepper Reads is somewhat better resourced than a typical informal gathering of book-loving friends.
Between meetings, students can listen to a podcast in which teaching staff from Carnegie Mellon’s English department discuss themes in the books under discussion.
At this gathering, students are meeting the author — the university has paid to fly her over from her home in Los Angeles.
One of the book club members is Jillian McCarthy, an academic programme adviser in Carnegie Mellon’s electrical and computer engineering department, who is studying for an MBA at Tepper part time.
“I am a big reader so I was pleasantly surprised when I came here and found this happening,” she says, adding that the resources made available to the MBA students make the book club she runs in Pittsburgh look “amateurish”.
Tepper Reads is a core part of Shift Programming, an addition to this year’s Tepper’s MBA programme that introduces literary and art criticism to business students to build their self-awareness and leadership skills.
The curriculum includes learning improv techniques at a theatre in Pittsburgh and private dinners with former alumni and academic staff.
Empathy classes are now a trend among business schools, with classes taught as lectures and in small seminar groups on many campuses.
But Shift takes the concept to another level by taking the teaching out of the classroom and into informal gatherings at the homes of faculty staff or on visits to local galleries.
The course is optional for MBA students but has proved so popular that there is a waiting list for the 150 places.
“We are the most human part of what can feel like a pretty mechanical degree experience,” says Leanne Meyer, executive director of the Accelerate Leadership Center at Tepper, who has led Shift’s development.
“MBA students are often looking for that one right answer to a question to get a competitive edge,” she adds.
“What we wanted to teach was that there is more than one way to think, so there might be three right answers. [The best student] is often the one who can make the best argument.”
Art appreciation is another key element of Shift.
Tepper has set aside space for the installation of a collection of wooden box structures with coloured bars.
It was created by Francis Collins, a Carnegie Mellon fine arts graduate and owner of a San Francisco construction company Dream Builders.
I join four students who are being shown around the installation by Elizabeth Chodos, director of the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon.
She notes that Mr Collins is both an artist and an entrepreneur — he donated $100,000 to Carnegie Mellon in September 2018 to form the Francis and Erin Collins Miller Institute of Contemporary Art Fund, enabling contemporary art to be installed around the university — so she feels he is very appropriate for a business school exhibition.
“My first task is to make the MBA students feel comfortable around the art,” Ms Chodos tells me afterwards. “There is this misperception that art is only for the few.”
Understanding what an artist intended to do is also a very good way to stretch a business school student’s empathetic skills, Ms Chodos adds.
“This is a living person communicating with living people through his art.”
The students on the tour are less forthcoming, perhaps because art appreciation is a long way from their previous experiences in the corporate world. “It is not a comfortable experience,” says Marc Rosenberg, a former systems analyst for Verizon, who is in the second year of the full-time MBA. “But I would not be here if I wasn’t happy coming out of my comfort zone.”
Some of the Shift students have struggled in the book group.
Ms Meyer recalls that one student asked how he should go about reading Ms Clemmons’s novel.
He had previously only read the necessary chapters in textbooks.
“It was amazing how few have read fiction before,” she says.
Ms Clemmons, who teaches at a college in LA when she is not writing, admits that meeting MBAs is helping her broaden her own outlook, adding that she was pleasantly surprised with the level of questions. “I like that they seem very open to creative paths, and I wasn’t expecting that,” she says. “I am pretty lefty, a socialist, but I am not afraid to talk to people who do not think like me.”
For Ms Clemmons, Shift presents an opportunity to reach out to a group that could be agents of change. “These students are likely to have a disproportionate impact on the world,” she says. “So if I can encourage them to be more empathetic that might change a lot of things.”

The international body responsible for setting 5G standards has warned that the US move to blacklist Chinese telecoms group Huawei could have “a dramatic impact” on future standardisation, with analysts warning it could lead to a bifurcation in development of the next-generation wireless technology.
Adrian Scrase, who heads up the 3GPP’s permanent support team, said: “We cannot speculate on what will happen, but if the current situation prevails — this could have a dramatic impact on future standardisation.”
Analysts see several risks, including a fracturing of the global standard setting system and a return to a bifurcated market — much as China’s great firewall has created a “splinternet” of what was conceived of as borderless cyber space.
Huawei and other Chinese groups already play a leading role in standard setting.
Georg Mayer, an executive at the telecoms group, leads one of three divisions that decides on technical specifications at 3GPP, the standards body.
The Shenzhen-based company also owns more 5G standard essential patents for the technology than any other company, according to market intelligence group IPlytics.
“The risk that 3GPP is going to break down is pretty high,” said Edison Lee, analyst at Jefferies.
He also sees a possibility that US companies will pull out of standards bodies if Huawei remains at the table but US patented technology — under the terms of the Entity List — cannot be licensed to the group.
“If Chinese companies are prohibited from licensing technologies that they have already seen — and which in many cases they have heavily influenced — [the risk is] they could just use it,” he said.
Bin Liu, analyst at Citibank, highlighted the risk of China pursuing its own standards, noting that the precedent for homegrown systems was not encouraging — not just in China but also Japan, which developed its cordless Personal Handy-phone System two decades ago.
“This is a bad lesson because Japanese equipment vendors lost opportunities after that,” he said.
“But one of the influencing factors for China is that it has a big market and already has some technological abilities, so may be different from Japan.”
Huawei has already been suspended from a number of international trade bodies, including Jedec, which sets guidelines for semiconductors.
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers last week reversed its decision to prohibit Huawei employees from participating in research reviews.
Any broader ditching of the company’s delegates would be a blow to China’s aim to accelerate the development of technology standards and be a leading voice.
Based on numbers, it can count on a measure of success.
At the 3GPP meeting, China claimed two vice-chairman roles in addition to Mr Mayer’s position.
Just two US companies are represented.

The White House budget office has requested more time to implement a law that bans companies dealing with Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment company, from doing business with the US federal government.
Russell Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, asked Congress for a two-year postponement to the current July 2020 deadline in order to help companies comply with the provisions aimed at Chinese companies, which were included in the current defence spending appropriations law.
In a letter to Mike Pence, the US vice-president and Senate president, and nine senior members of Congress, Mr Vought said the delay would “better ensure the effective implementation of the prohibition without compromising desired security objectives”.
Mr Vought asked Congress to include the changes in new legislation.
If Congress approves the delay — either in the fiscal 2020 defence spending bill that is currently being negotiated on Capitol Hill or other legislation — it would provide a temporary reprieve for Huawei, which has suffered the brunt of a series of tough US government actions aimed at the Shenzhen-based company. But the White House stressed that the move was purely about timing and did not represent a shift in stance on Huawei.
“There is not a change to administration policy with regard to Huawei and would not delay the ban taking effect this year on the federal government doing business with them,” said Jacob Wood, OMB spokesperson.
“This is about ensuring that companies who do business with the US government or receive federal grants and loans have time to extricate themselves from doing business with Huawei and other Chinese tech companies listed in the [National Defense Authorisation Act]”.
In addition to a tougher congressional stance against Huawei, US president Donald Trump last month took two aggressive steps against the company following mounting concerns among US security experts that the telecoms group could help the Chinese government conduct electronic espionage, particularly across ultrafast 5G networks.
In one of those moves, the commerce department placed Huawei on the “entity list”, which means US companies have to obtain licences in order to sell any equipment or software to Huawei.
Mr Wood said the OMB request “would not stop or delay the restrictions Commerce announced on the sale of US technology to Huawei”.
While US intelligence and security officials have spent the past two years urging Mr Trump to take a tougher line on Huawei, the president has suggested that the recent moves, which he had previously resisted, were taken after the collapse of trade negotiations between the two countries.
Speaking in Japan at the G20 finance ministers meeting at the weekend, Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, also linked the two issues.
“What the president is saying is, if we move forward on trade, that perhaps he’ll be willing to do certain things on Huawei if he gets comfort from China on that and certain guarantees,” Mr Mnuchin said, according to Reuters.
“But these are national security issues.”
The federal ban on doing business with Huawei was included in the National Defence Authorisation Act passed last year.
Huawei is challenging the ban in court, claiming it breaks the law by singling out one company for punishment.
Large telecoms companies have already stopped using Huawei equipment in their networks in advance of the ban coming into force.
The biggest effect of the ban is likely to be felt by smaller rural telecoms companies that have relied on Huawei, primarily for cost reasons.
Those companies are particularly concerned about a rule being proposed by the Federal Communications Commission that would cut them off from federal grants and loans if they continue to use the Chinese company’s equipment.
In his letter, Mr Vought said rural recipients of federal grants could be “disproportionally impacted” by the law.
A group of senators from both political parties have proposed a bill that would give those rural carriers $700m to help fund the costs of cutting off Huawei — though some in the industry say the cost could rise to billions.

China will establish a mechanism for export control of sensitive technology, raising the spectre of tit-for-tat retaliation amid a souring trade dispute with the United States.
The announcement comes as both sides expand their dispute beyond simple tariffs, after the most recent round of trade negotiations ended without a deal in May.
Since then, the Trump administration has blacklisted Chinese telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, while China has threatened to punish foreign companies that cut off ties with Huawei by listing them as “ unreliable”.
The export control mechanism — which appears to be based on a draft law first proposed by the Ministry of Commerce two years ago — would “prevent and resolve national security risks”, Xinhua said.
Details would be released soon, it added.
The new Chinese regulations could prove similar to US export controls on strategic technologies.
Those controls, covering military equipment, some encryption technologies, and some dual-use products, have long irked China.
Chinese negotiators have often claimed that their trade surplus could be trimmed if the US would relax controls on high-tech goods.
While covering nuclear and military materials, the draft Chinese law also included latitude for retaliation if China is subject to discriminatory export control measures by any other country, according to a 2018 report by consultancy PwC.
“This is a major step to improve [China’s system] and also a move to counter the US crackdown,” tweeted Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid that is sometimes used to float ideas that are not yet official policy. “Once taking effect, some technology exports to the US will be subject to the control.”
The mechanism will be developed by the National Development and Reform Commission under the guidelines of China’s  national security law, passed in 2015, Xinhua said.
It didn't mention the draft law released by MofCom in 2017, which was based on US regulations that limit export of military and strategic technology.
“China . . . appears to be implementing a longer-term strategy that recognises its competitive advantage in manufacturing, while building towards competing for control over the real value in the modern supply chain — intellectual property,” Jeanine Daou, a tax specialist at PwC Middle East, concluded in the PwC report.
China has said it would retaliate against foreign companies that arbitrarily refuse to do business with Huawei, putting multinationals in the middle of a tug of war over which country dominates the next generation of technology. Last month, the NDRC implied it would block exports of  rare earths, a material with many strategic applications including smartphones, lasers, instrument panels, wind turbines and MRI machines and more than 90 per cent of hybrid and electric cars.

When I was about 12, one of my parents’ friends asked me whether I was having a happy childhood.
I replied that no, I wasn’t having a particularly happy time of it.
My father overheard and was furious. “You have an idyllic childhood. You are very happy. What nonsense!” And because he was my father, my beloved but scary father, I felt I was somehow wrong and bad.
Parents so want their children to be happy that sometimes they try to scold them into it.
What my father missed back then, something we can often miss, was an opportunity to connect with his child.
After our guest had gone, my father could have asked what I was feeling and decided not to take the answer, whatever it may have been, as an attack on him.
To understand and validate a child’s feelings is invaluable to them.
I’m not saying he had to let go of his perspective; after living through the second world war and witnessing terrible things, he would have seen my childhood as idyllic.
But that would not preclude his helping me to articulate what I felt and trying to see things from my point of view.
Unfortunately, a child’s unhappiness can make a parent feel like a failure and therefore discourage them from exploring the child’s feelings, wanting to close them down instead.
Parents can find themselves arguing with their children because they cannot perceive the feelings behind their words or actions.
Suppose you are a parent catching up on some work after spending a whole day the previous week with the kids at a theme park, when your child says to you in an unhappy voice, “We never go out”.
It is a saint of a parent who can resist replying, “What rubbish! We went to Legoland last week.”
But suppose you found your saintly side and said instead, “You sound bored and fed up. What would you like to be doing?” The child might then feel seen and understood. They might say, “I’d like to go back to Legoland again.” You would then have a moment of connection when you’d reply, “Yeah, that was fun wasn’t it.”
Of course, I’m not saying that parents can give a child everything they want, or that it is desirable to do so, but in being kind to children as they face up to life’s inevitable disappointments, we can teach them to cope with frustration better.
Moments of connection, of being seen and understood, are important to all of us.
Children will often feel differently than their parents might about any given situation, but it is important that their feelings, whatever they may be, are not dismissed.
When our feelings are considered and validated, it helps our self-esteem and this is even more important for children as they develop and grow.
As a psychotherapist, I have sat with those coming to terms with both what they experienced, and what they didn’t, in childhood.
A lot were frustrated that their parents never seemed curious about their lives.
Some felt loved because their parents saw them as an extension of themselves but never felt their parents found them likeable.
If you could redo your childhood, what would you wish for?
Almost all parents are good people, and yet too often they never really get to know their children, or their worlds, resulting in relationships where too much is hidden and where they are driven more often by a sense of duty than by love.
A child should know they are a priority and that they can show and share their feelings, that they are taken seriously.
Monsters under the bed are not silly — they are a way of children showing their parents that they need them close, calm and accepting.
Children are not projects — something we get right or ruin — or chores to get through, but people to relate to.
This is the crucial, most important thing for a parent to hold in mind.
That what they need consciously to treasure, think about and work on is not so much their child, but their relationship with their child.
It is nearly the same thing, but too often by focusing only on the child, parents cannot see how their own responses affect their offspring.
They need to respond to each child as the individual they are, not to fall back on labels such as “the girl”, “the boy”, “the oldest”, “the youngest”, or generalisations about children.
Parents tend to be good at thinking about their children’s future and what opportunities they can create for them when choosing schools and setting targets, but it is even more important to be in the present with them — to see, understand and accept them where they are now.
If parents go with what works for their child in the present, the future is often a lot easier.
One of the most important indicators for the good mental health of a child is a strong bond with their parents — a healthy, functioning relationship.
But how do you make that attachment as rewarding as possible for both parties, and one that is most likely to create the capacity for a child’s happiness?
From the beginning, children are primed for dialogue.
A parent and baby will naturally take turns with facial expressions and noises.
This sort of interaction usually happens spontaneously, without even thinking about it.
It’s the beginning of dialogue, of speech and of being mutually affected by each other.
These patterns of reciprocity are crucial.
It is too easy to fall into a habit of just doing all the necessary things to the baby or to the children, such as cleaning and feeding them, rather than relating to them and being influenced by them.
Which relationships frustrate you more than others?
It is probably those where you feel you make no difference and feel unheard.
Children feel the same.
If parents don’t let them in, don’t allow themselves to be altered by their children’s views, then their children are less likely to take in how the parents, in turn, want to influence them.
Personally, I did not find reciprocity as a parent an easy thing to do.
Maybe because being listened to and considered was not an everyday experience for me as I was growing up.
It was as though I often experienced my baby’s needs as a drain or too demanding.
I had to work at reprogramming myself to respond to them in an attuned-to-the-baby way rather than seeing them as some sort of assault.
I think I had an unconscious belief that the adult had to be the “doer” and the child the “done-to”.
We tend to do what was done to us, and in some cases it seems that our innate ability to respond naturally to our babies and children has been deadened by a culture that seems to be suspicious of the normal mammalian cries of an infant.
It has also unfortunately become normal to believe that if a parent naturally, instinctively responds to their cries, we will invite some sort of catastrophe.
If we are not responded to naturally in a mutual, reciprocal way as infants and children, it can interfere with our innate responsiveness later in life.
The late psychiatrist RD Laing referred to this inability to be affected by others as “diaphobia” — a fear of dialogue, reciprocity and being influenced.
For babies, children and indeed adults, being responded to is a need and the responses of a parent tend to mean a lot more to a person than attention from other sources.
If parents habitually fail to respond to a child’s cries, glances or turn-taking games, there’s a danger of handing down to them a distorted pattern of how to form attachments and maintain relationships.
If you are a parent, and feel you may be diaphobic, do not admonish yourself, or be in denial about it, or be ashamed.
When you recognise you are interrupting the natural process of give and take in your exchanges with your child, you can make the changes that will allow you to attune to them, like I had to.
It is easier to spot diaphobia in others than it is in ourselves, but parents should try to notice when they are avoiding contact with their baby, child, teenager or adult child.
They should try to notice if they tend to talk at them rather than with them.
They should try to practise being open and leaving space for them to talk or gesture, and concentrate more on observing and listening, rather than thinking about what their response will be or what they “should” be saying.
When parents slip up — and we all do — saying sorry is helpful.
You can probably remember times in your own relationship with your parents when they didn’t believe you, or snapped at you out of the blue.
Think of the power an apology would have — even perhaps if it came years later.
It is natural on some level to idolise parents, so if children are misunderstood by them, they often blame themselves at the expense of their own confidence.
When I was talking about this, one parent asked me: “But isn’t it always necessary to be right with children, so that they feel secure?” The answer is no. It is important instead that parents are real and authentic, so that they don’t interfere with their children’s instincts.
A child will know when their parents are not in tune with them or with what’s happening and if parents pretend otherwise, they are dulling their child’s instincts.
Instinct is a major component of confidence, competence and intelligence, so it’s a good idea not to warp a child’s.
We are all busy and, these days, not only are both parents likely to work, they may even have to do more than one job each.
There’s a feeling of getting left behind, having to keep up.
It is true for most children that you can delegate some minding of them to relatives or paid helpers, but what is true for all is that you cannot delegate the everyday love they need from their primary attachment figures, also known as parents.
Children won’t form on their own like seedlings; they form in relationship with others.
Being a parent is time-consuming.
Where possible, it is better to invest that time positively by pre-empting problems rather than negatively after they have arisen.
When a parent goes too fast for the pace of their child instead of respecting their rhythms of give and take, when they live too much in the future and what needs to get done rather than being with them in the present, they risk storing up trouble that is going to take even longer to untangle and repair.
Children are our most important resource.
We should invest time in them, be present for them, enter their world and let them be part of ours.
After all, a child’s relationship with their parents is the blueprint for how they will form relationships for the rest of their lives.
These should ideally be based on mutual trust and respect, authenticity, co-operation, collaboration and love — rather than manipulation, winning and losing, and duty — both for now and for the sake of all our futures.

China’s onshore renminbi fell to its weakest level in six months versus the US dollar on Monday, following comments by the country’s central bank head that hinted the currency could be permitted to slide further.
In Asian morning trading hours, the onshore renminbi faded by as much as 0.4 per cent against its US counterpart to Rmb6.9352, with the Chinese currency touching its weakest point since November 2018.
The onshore renminbi had suffered its worst month since July in May, weakening 2.5 per cent.
The decline in the renminbi came after Yi Gang, governor of the People’s Bank of China, told Bloomberg in an interview on Friday that  no “numerical number” is more important than any other when asked if there was a red line on the currency’s exchange rate. That has prompted speculation that Chinese authorities could permit the renminbi to fall past the psychologically important level of Rmb7 to the dollar.
Mr Yi also said that Chinese officials have “tremendous” room to ease monetary policy via cuts in interest rates and banks’ reserve requirement ratios if no resolution to the country’s trade war with the United States continues to escalate.
His “comments have refuelled the speculation that the USD-CNY exchange rate could go beyond 7.0 handle sooner than expected,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank.
“We have seen increasing talks circulated in the onshore market in order to downplay the necessity of defending the seven [to the dollar] mark,” said Qi Gao, a currency strategist at Scotiabank. Mr Yi’s “comments suggested further downside potential for the onshore yuan interest rates and China’s government bond yields”.
Which way the currency goes next will depend heavily on the likelihood of a resolution in trade tensions between the world’s top two economies, strategists say.
Investors have trained their sights on the G20 meeting in Osaka set for June 28 and 29, where hopes are pinned on the possibility of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reaching some kind of breakthrough.
“I am inclined to see more volatility ahead of the G20, but the USD-CNY won’t breach above 7.0 before the Osaka meeting,” said Commerzbank’s Mr Zhou.
While a weaker renminbi could help boost the Chinese economy by supporting exporters, it also  poses risks, such as inflating US-China tensions further.
“After Osaka, the market needs to re-assess this hypothesis, but letting the currency go is a double-edged sword,” Mr Zhou added.

China’s Hansoh Pharmaceutical raised HK$7.9bn （$1bn） in Hong Kong’s second-biggest initial public offering this year, with the company pricing at the top of its indicated range.
The Jiangsu-based group sold 551.3m shares to investors at HK$14.26 （$1.82） each, according to a term sheet seen by the Financial Times on Thursday.
Hansoh makes about half of its revenues from cancer drugs but also sells treatments for diabetes and conditions that affect the central nervous system.
The pharmaceuticals company plans to use just under half of the proceeds from the share sale on research and development, including on new treatments and technologies, and overseas drug development programmes.
The rest of the proceeds will be used on improving manufacturing capabilities, sales and marketing, and for working capital purposes.
An overallotment option, or “greenshoe”, could raise the size of the offering to about $1.15bn.
Cornerstone investors include GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, and private equity firms Hillhouse Capital and Boyu Capital, according to the people familiar with Hansoh’s plans.
Hansoh is set to start trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange on June 14, according to the term sheet.
Morgan Stanley and Citi are the joint sponsors.
The offering comes in a slow year for listings in Hong Kong.
The city was the world’s top IPO destination in 2018, attracting $37bn worth of new share offerings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
But this year, the city has drawn less than $6bn in new share listings, the biggest of which was the $1.2bn stock offering in Chinese securities broker Shenwan Hongyuan last month.

Megvii, the Chinese facial recognition company backed by Alibaba, is reassessing plans to go to market this year, according to bankers and investors, as the backlash against the sector and broader Sino-US tensions intensify.
Megvii was valued at $4bn at its last funding round and hired bankers with a view to launching an initial public offering — at one point targeting as much as $1bn — this year.
Since then, however, the ratcheting up of China and US tensions, which has broadened beyond trade to include the tech sector, has soured sentiment.
Megvii, China’s second-biggest facial recognition company, has also been ensnared in growing international concerns over Beijing’s use of surveillance of its citizens and is reportedly one of the Chinese companies the Trump administration is considering adding to its export blacklist. Megvii has said it is not aware of being on any US government list, adding that “the current geopolitical climate leads to inaccurate and unhelpful speculation”.
“Around Megvii in particular there’s concern about who they are selling to and what the end use of the products is,” said one tech sector banker.
“Megvii’s critical vertical is surveillance and security and they earn more revenues from that compared with [rival] SenseTime.”
He added that underwriters continued to “work fiercely” on the IPO but “at the very least they will have to go through the grinder with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange . . . because how can you be [suitable] for listing if you are put on the entity list?”
The dire performance of China tech companies that listed last year is also weighing on Megvii’s plans. Xiaomi, the smartphone maker that came to market in July with a valuation of $54bn, has seen the price of its stock almost halve while shares in food delivery group Meituan Dianping are some 14 per cent below the IPO price.
“Megvii is still thinking about the potential [to IPO] this year, but timing also has to coincide with the right window,” said one investor. Megvii declined to comment.
Megvii’s bigger rival SenseTime, which was also a potential IPO candidate this year, is now unlikely to tap markets until next year or even 2021, according to investors and bankers.
“SenseTime is in no hurry to IPO and it’s quite profitable,” said one investor.
An absence of the two AI groups would leave further dent China tech’s IPO calendar.
Early last year, bullish bankers predicted a bulging pipeline headed by three megadeals: ByteDance, the short streaming and news app; Didi Chuxing, the ride-hailing group; and Ant Financial, the world’s most valuable unicorn at $150bn.
In addition to some company-specific issues, the US-China trade war has left investors wary.
Start-ups are torn between a desire to list, and provide an exit for increasingly antsy investors, and holding back until sentiment swings back.
Megvii itself got a taste of the thriftier environment at its last fundraising in May, which was dominated by Chinese state-backed entities rather than the strategic and global financial sponsors that led by far the bulk of deals last year.

Traditional stockpicking fund managers have enjoyed an unusually good stretch in recent weeks even as machine-driven “quant” funds have fizzled, nurturing hopes that rockier markets may help human investors launch a comeback.
Over half of all US mutual funds that invest in big American companies managed to beat the broader stock market in May for the second month in a row, according to Bank of America.
This indicates that many managed to navigate the recent trade war-related turbulence.
So far this year 47 per cent are outperforming the broad Russell 1000 index.
Although this still means that over half of US “large-cap” equity mutual funds are trailing the market, if sustained this would be one of the best beat rates in the post-crisis era.
Moreover, 54 per cent are beating the blue-chip S&P 500 index.
Traditional, active asset managers have long argued that they would prove their worth in less buoyant markets. Although the long-term evidence that stockpickers outperform in downturns is patchy, their recent run will be encouraging to investment groups that have battled torrential outflows year after year since the crisis.
Active equity funds have shed another $169bn already this year, taking the cumulative outflows over the past decade to $1.31tn, according to EPFR, a mutual fund data provider.
In contrast, passive equity funds have attracted over $24bn this year, and $1.9tn over the past decade.
“If active management is ever going to come back, it has to show it can do better in a downturn than the machines can,” said Michael Hartnett, a senior Bank of America strategist.
Algorithmic, “quantitative” funds continued to underperform in May, with just 34 per cent beating their benchmarks due to heavy exposure to underperforming factors like “value” stocks, according to Bank of America.
However, these are mostly “long-only”, relatively simple quant funds that typically only mine one or several well-known signals, such as the long-term tendency for cheap stocks or those with strong balance sheets to perform well.
Many quant hedge funds have bounced back this year, especially systematic trend-surfers.
Systematica’s flagship $2.7bn BlueTrend fund lost over 10 per cent last year but is up more than 8 per cent already this year.
Similarly, Aspect Capital’s $3.6bn Diversified fund has returned over 10 per cent in 2019, after shedding 14.6 per cent in 2018.
The strongest comeback has come from Cantab’s Aristarchus fund, which has flipped last year’s 23 per cent loss into a 20.5 per cent return already in 2019.
The investment industry itself remains gloomy about its future, as relentless pressure on fees and rising cost pressures is expected to crimp asset management margins in the coming years and decades.
Moreover, previous flashes of robust active performance have quickly faded and the longer-term record of active management remains underwhelming.
The recent woes of Neil Woodford, a well-known UK stockpicker, shows how fund managers can often see their reputation crumble quickly and a once-deft touch suddenly seem like luck.
Dimensional Fund Advisors’ latest report on the US mutual fund industry indicated that of the 2,314 equity funds that existed two decades ago, only 42 per cent have survived and a mere 23 per cent have outperformed their benchmarks.
“A lot of funds die, and of those that survive only a few outperform the market,” said Marlena Lee, co-head of research at DFA.
Even in fixed income, often assumed to be a less efficient, more active-friendly market, the data are grim reading.
Of the 1,826 bond funds registered two decades ago, only 41 per cent are still around, and just 8 per cent have beaten their benchmarks over those 20 years.

A populist is someone who abhors the metropolis and demands its respect.
According to the cultural right, big cities are teetering Babels, lawless and ghettoised, but also wealth-hoarding success stories that look down at the conservative provinces.
“You crammed and besieged losers,” this Tom Wolfe-ish attitude to urbanites seems to say, “we are just as good as you.”
All of which helps to explain why some British populists back a foreign president over the mayor of their own liberal capital.
The running tiff between Donald Trump and Sadiq Khan is modern politics — closed versus open — in miniature.
But there is more behind the courtship of the visiting president than that.
There is foreign policy at work.
The British right sees the US as a natural companion in a post-Brexit world.
If a no-deal Brexit puts the UK out in the European cold, it hopes to warm its hands on the fire of a fast-growing America.
That hope should be checked.
British conservatives have been misreading American ones since Dwight Eisenhower declined to look away as the Suez Canal was summarily invaded.
Yes, there is a promising bonhomie between Mr Trump and Boris Johnson, the former UK foreign secretary.
And the US right cherishes the nation state, not the EU, as the last word in human organisation.
Both countries also talk an excellent game about a bilateral trade deal.
They just happen to have divergent interests on the largest question of the century, that’s all.
Even before Brexit, the UK viewed China as a commercial opportunity.
Its disposition will have to become even warmer once it loses full membership of its own continental trading bloc.
It is not in a position to pick and choose its economic friends.
All the while, the US is moving in the opposite direction twice as fast.
It is actually more suspicious of China than it was when it began its tariff campaign a year ago.
What could then have been explained away as one quixotic president’s attempt to secure better trading terms has become a wider confrontation.
Mr Trump’s views have caught on in formerly laissez-faire boardrooms and in once-orthodox Washington symposia.
To call it a consensus is a leap.
Some eminent Americans hope to rattle China a bit and leave it at that.
Others aspire to nothing less than the eventual decoupling of the two economies.
But the general direction of US thought, and its incompatibility with the UK’s Chinese interests, is unmistakable.
And possibly intractable.
If this seems a more theoretical than actual problem, then look to the recent past for a case study.
In 2015, when London signed up to the Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Washington chafed at this “constant accommodation” of China.
And that was under the Barack Obama administration.
Imagine a replay under Mr Trump or another populist.
Because Britain has long been out of the superpower business, the rise of China has no implications for its own status.
Its economic interests and its foreign policy can be almost the same thing.
The US is in a very different predicament.
It is a ruling power facing demotion by （in its mind） a revisionist one.
Its foreign policy has to go beyond entrepreneurial nimbleness.
No doubt, close partners can bicker over one thing while remaining in broad concert.
But it is an odd partnership that contains such opposing views on quite so important a third party.
As time wears on, this strategic tension cannot be glossed over with the usual grammar of UK-US meetings: the one-sided flattery, the talk of “cousins” that belies the non-British ancestry of even most white Americans.
This state visit had its stresses.
The question of the tech giant Huawei, which the two countries view with differing levels of suspicion, came up.
Such wedge questions are likelier to multiply than to recede over the years.
Singapore, Germany, Australia, Brazil: lots of countries hope not to have to choose between the US and China.
But the UK plan — to be ultra-intimate with the one while profiting from the other — is another order of ambition.
That British conservatives put so much hope in Mr Trump, and found Mr Obama’s anglophilia so wanting, only defeats their own argument.
The “special” relationship, it seems, is a transcendent fact of the world, as immutable as force equals mass times acceleration, and yet entirely dependent on whoever is in the White House at any given moment.
Well, for now, that occupant is Mr Trump.
Sympathy for Brexit is certainly one part of his worldview.
But mistrust of China is much the larger.
It is not a mistrust all countries can afford.

Samsung Electronics is cutting production and laying off workers at its only remaining smartphone plant in China amid slowing sales as it continues to shift production to lower-cost Asia locations.
The move at Samsung’s plant in Huizhou city, Guangdong province, comes as the South Korean company struggles to compete against Chinese rivals offering cheaper but competitive smartphones.
Samsung has only about 1 per cent market share in China, down from about 20 per cent in 2013, according to Strategy Analytics.
To counter rising labour costs in China, Samsung has been shifting smartphone production from China to Vietnam and India in the past decade.
Analysts expect the Sino-US trade war to accelerate that shift.
“Due to challenging market situations and intensified competition in China, we are currently adjusting production volume at Samsung Electronics Huizhou,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
It did not provide any details.
Analysts expect Samsung to eventually shut the plant as the company is unlikely to reverse its flagging fortunes in China.
CW Chung, a Nomura analyst, said: “In the past, Samsung needed smartphone plants in China because of lower wages and its huge market there. But such merits no longer exist and Samsung has no reason to keep producing phones in China.”
On Wednesday, the world’s largest smartphone maker said that no decision had been made on whether to close the Huizhou plant, which opened in 1992.
The factory had more than 6,000 workers to produce 63m smartphones in 2017 or 17 per cent of Samsung’s global production that year, according to Caixin, a Chinese financial news magazine.

Christine Lagarde has warned that rising tariffs between the world’s two largest economies were “self-inflicted wounds” that would hit the already precarious global recovery, calling on both Washington and Beijing to immediately remove the levies.
The International Monetary Fund chief said the group’s economists believe the recently-imposed tariffs by the US and China would cut global growth by 0.3 per cent next year.
When earlier tariffs are added, the IMF sees a 0.5 per cent hit to growth — or about $455bn, “larger than the size of South Africa’s economy”.
The report, published ahead of this weekend’s meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 industrial powers in Japan, came amid renewed signs that the US economy could be losing momentum.
A closely watched measure of employment, a monthly report from payroll processor ADP, showed the private sector in the US had added the fewest jobs in more than nine years, with employers outside the agricultural sector adding just 27,000 positions last month, badly missing expectations.
“Job growth is moderating. Labour shortages are impeding job growth, particularly at small companies, and lay-offs at bricks-and-mortar retailers are hurting,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.
Despite the gathering clouds around the global economy, Wall Street rallied for a second day on expectations the bad economic news would force the Federal Reserve to cut rates two or three times this year to keep the US economy on track.
Federal funds futures data suggest the odds of at least three quarter-point reductions in the Fed’s benchmark rate this year were at about 63 per cent on Wednesday, from 53 per cent a day earlier.
Just a month ago, the implied probability of such a scenario was effectively nil.
Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, and other members of the central bank’s rate-setting committee signalled this week that they were prepared to cut rates for the first time since the financial crisis in the face of the mounting headwinds.
Ms Lagarde has been warning for months about the risks the trade war launched by President Donald Trump could have on the global economy, but her remarks on Wednesday were among her most pointed to date.
“These are self-inflicted wounds that must be avoided. How? By removing the recently implemented trade barriers and by avoiding further barriers in whatever form,” she wrote in a statement accompanying the IMF forecast.
Although Mr Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to discuss their tariff stand-off at a summit next month, there are few signs either side is backing down.
The US increased tariffs on $250bn worth of Chinese goods in May, while Beijing responded with additional levies on nearly $60bn of US imports.
Mr Trump has threatened to place tariffs on another $300bn in imports from China.
Mr Trump has shown a willingness to use tariffs as a policy tool more broadly, announcing he would impose new tariffs on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to coerce the Mexican government into firmer action on illegal immigration.
Ms Lagarde said those tariffs are “also of concern”, and some congressional Republicans have rebelled against the move, particularly in the Republican-controlled Senate, which is weighing an effort to block the tariffs.
US leaders, including vice-president Mike Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo were due to meet a high-level Mexican delegation at the White House on Wednesday to discuss their differences.
One in five of the major Mexican companies with cross-border interests — including key car parts manufacturers, fridge maker Mabe, state energy company Pemex and the producer of José Cuervo tequila — could see their revenues hurt if the US goes ahead with tariffs starting next Monday, Fitch Ratings reported on Wednesday.
Fitch estimated that 20 per cent of the 41 major cross-border issuers for which it provide ratings would feel the pain.

The US Commerce Department has warned that any halt to China’s rare earth exports would cause “significant shocks” to US and foreign supply chains.
The commerce department said the US was “heavily dependent” on foreign sources of the minerals, which made the country vulnerable to actions by foreign governments.
The department said the US should streamline the permitting process for domestic mining and boost efforts to recycle critical minerals as part of a strategy to boost domestic production.
The report, which was published on Tuesday, comes after warnings by China that it would place controls on its exports of rare earths, 17 elements critical to electronics and electric cars.
China produces over 80 per cent of the world’s rare earths, as well as a majority of the products that use them such as powerful magnets used in electric and hybrid cars.
In 2010 China was reported to have halted exports of rare earths to Japan amid a territorial dispute over the East China Sea.
“If China or Russia were to stop exports to the United States and its allies for a prolonged period — similar to China’s rare earths embargo in 2010 — an extended supply disruption could cause significant shocks throughout US and foreign critical mineral supply chains,” the Commerce Department said.
The report said that Federal permitting and land management policies had “inhibited access” to critical mineral deposits and proposed streamlining the process.
The US also lacked domestic processing and manufacturing capabilities for critical minerals, it said.
That “makes the United States vulnerable to potential geoeconomic and geopolitical actions from foreign governments that may lead to price and demand volatility for specific minerals, as well as potential supply disruptions causing mineral shortfalls,” it said.

It is a question that thousands of lawyers have faced for decades: can you be a mother and still make partner? Last year, just over half of entrants to law school in the US were women; in Britain, it was two-thirds. Yet in 2018 women made up just 19 per cent of equity partners in British law firms, according to PwC, the consultancy, while a McKinsey study from 2017 showed the same figure.
The generally accepted issue is the choice many women face between partnership — on call 24/7 and under pressure to generate business — or starting a family.
At the same time, says David Wilkins, director of the Center on the Legal Profession at Harvard Law School, there are limited equity partnership positions as many firms look to cut costs.
These factors combine to have “a disproportionate impact on women because they still bear the majority burden of childcare and childraising, and the sole burden of childbearing,” he says.
Yet increasingly those campaigning for greater diversity in the legal profession say it is wrong to accept this as inevitable and are pressing firms to find solutions. While overt sexual discrimination is often challenged, unconscious bias and lazy assumptions are also holding women back, says Farmida Bi, chair at Norton Rose Fulbright.
For example, partners looking to build a team to work on a deal may assume a mother will not want a demanding client calling at 2am, or to travel frequently for work.
These assumptions are not made about fathers.
Firms seeking to improve diversity at the top need to make alterations to their processes, says Ms Bi.
The problem is exacerbated by pressure to bring work into the firm, says Sarah Chilton, a partner at CM Murray, which specialises in partnership and employment law.
“In professional services generally there is a feeling that you have to justify your existence. When it comes to originations and billings, is someone being denied the opportunity to build that up because the person distributing work has a conscious or unconscious bias against them?”
Charting a route back to work
Because the traditional law firm model is a constant move towards “up or out” — partnership for those who make the grade, the exit for those who do not — firms need to identify talented associates early to stop them self-selecting “out” if they plan for children, says Melinda Wallman, partner at recruitment company Mlegal.
Ms Wallman co-founded Reignite Academy, a programme that helps City lawyers return after a career break. “They need to say, ‘we want you to stay and make partner, and if you want to have a family, we want to be the firm you come back to’,” she says.
Firms serious about preventing women from falling behind while they are on maternity or family leave should also implement more regulated staffing and client management systems to stop the relationships with important clients being entrusted solely to men, she adds.
It is also important “not to forget people exist while they are on maternity leave”, says Ms Chilton.
“Invite them to lunches and events, allow them to keep up their contacts. Writing articles is something easy to offer someone on maternity leave — they can do that without leaving the house and . . . it keeps their name in the market.”
More fundamentally, Ms Wallman questions the idea that partners need to be permanently on call. “Do you need to be full-time, 24/7 to be a successful law firm partner?” she asks. “We need to make it possible to do these roles on less . . . it is important for women but also for the next generation.”
Law firms like to talk about flexible working to suit incoming generations who demand a greater flexibility and work-life balance from their employers.
But they are “particularly bad” at defining the partner’s role in new ways, says Ms Chilton.
“They think a partner has to be a rainmaker,” she says, “but they could contribute to the partnership by taking on major management roles, or some departmental head roles.”
Is it time for quotas?
In 2011 the US-based Women in Law Empowerment Forum launched a “gold standard” award for firms that hit gender diversity targets.
Firms need a minimum of 20 per cent female equity partners, plus various other criteria, to get that rating.
Betiayn Tursi, co-founder and chair of the forum, says targets need to be “aspirational” and realistic. “Fifty per cent is a false narrative,” she says. Given that 40 years ago most law firms might have one or two female partners, it is important to play the long game, she adds. The forum introduced its gold standard to the UK this year.
For Dana Denis-Smith, founder of the First 100 Years project, which promotes the history of women in the law, self-imposed targets have failed and change needs to be forced through. In February, she called for quotas for the number of women at equity partnership and management level. Only that way, she argued, could women break through the “incredibly rigid, inflexible and artificial places” that were law firm offices.
That makes many female lawyers uneasy, worried that clients will assume they have been thrust into roles to make the statistics look good.
Ms Denis-Smith dismisses this fear: “Women forget that they’re really good. I’ve never heard of a balanced or diverse partnership underperforming.”
Ms Chilton agrees. “The statistics are so awful that quotas are not a bad thing,” she says. “Having quotas would encourage firms to make sure females have achieved what they need to achieve to make partnership.” Targets of 20-25 per cent are “depressing”, adds Ms Chilton. “If you only have a target of 25 per cent, you’re never going to exceed it, and it is so out of kilter with the number of associates.” Most leading firms have a roughly 50:50 gender split at associate level, or a slight female majority. That makes the partnership statistics all the more shocking.
Clients have a role to play
In-house general counsel and clients also have a role to play in pressuring firms they work with to increase diversity at the top, says Ms Wallman.
When clients demand diverse partnerships in order to secure contracts — as dozens of general counsels have recently called for in open letters — firms are forced to prioritise the issue.
This works both ways, however.
Those who until now have expected to be able to reach lawyers at any time of day or night need an understanding of what requests are urgent and what can wait until morning.
Ms Denis-Smith has also criticised the position of salaried partner — a lawyer with the title of partner but without a share in the firm’s profits or a say in how it is run. That, she says, is merely to make the partnership figures looks better. “The whole business model needs to be opened up,” she says.
Ultimately, having diversity at the top is essential for inspiring the next generation, especially in a time when firms are competing with in-house legal departments or smaller firms who can offer fulfilling careers without the punishing hours.
“The worst thing for diversity is to have marginal partners,” says Prof Wilkins. “Make your women and minorities superstars so that younger people can look at them and say ‘I can succeed’.”

A small Virginia-based entrant to the exchange-traded fund market has raised eyebrows among industry veterans as it attempts to answer one of the most pressing questions for investors: how do you protect your money from the fallout of a trade war?
Investors have honed in on companies thought to be hardest hit by disputes over trade, as tensions between the US and China escalated last month and Washington opened up new lines of attack on Mexico and India last week.
Semiconductor groups have suffered in particular, along with car companies, as their shares have lagged broader indices around the world.
MCAM International of Charlottesville is offering another way to play the tense environment, launching its debut ETF on Wednesday under the ticker “TWAR”. The new product aims to track an index of 120 companies selected for their ability to outperform competitors during an international trade war as a result of their “government patronage”, which could include state contracts or subsidies, according to regulatory filings.
“There is reason to think that [these companies] will benefit from . . . government protection of some sort,” said David Martin, founder and chief executive of MCAM. “It would be a gross misrepresentation to say they will be insulated but the expectation is that they will suffer less.”
But even before its launch, industry veterans are questioning the upstart’s approach, citing a host of other niche ETFs that have failed to gain traction.
According to research firm ETFGI, there were 7,774 ETFs and other exchange-traded products around the world at the end of April, holding some $5.6tn of assets.
“It’s extremely difficult to break through the clutter in the ETF space and I do not think this is the way to do it,” said Dave Nadig, managing director at ETF.com. “I am sceptical.”
Mr Nadig added that fees on the TWAR fund are high, at 81 basis points.
State Street’s $250bn-in-assets S&P 500 ETF called SPY, by contrast, charges 9.5bp.
MCAM’s background is not in ETFs. The group specialises in helping banks exploit their intangible assets, such as intellectual property, and also runs CNBC’s IQ 100 index, which ranks companies that derive significant revenue from proprietary technology. MCAM will launch two other ETFs on Wednesday that track such companies.
The underlying index for the new trade war ETF also sifts companies by the strength of their intellectual property, but goes one step further, marrying it with an assessment of their ties with the government.
In May, however, four of the index’s top-five holdings — General Electric, Cisco Systems, Xerox and IBM — underperformed the S&P 500 index.
The exception was Advanced Micro Devices, which did better than the large-cap benchmark.
Mr Martin said that being protected from the fallout of a trade war does not insulate a company from other factors that may affect its performance, but added that over time the strategy should win out.
Not everyone is convinced. “I would be a little sceptical given everything that is going on,” said one ETF industry veteran. “I don’t know how a company that has patents or business with the government will necessarily benefit. It is very difficult to know what president Trump will actually do in the end.”

In the battle against international money laundering, cryptocurrency remains the weakest link.
Users can receive payments from unknown sources from around the world, which makes it hard for the network to keep out the proceeds of crime — ransom cyber attacks, drug trafficking, or worse.
An extensive network of dealers also buy or sell crypto against cash.
Until now, it has been relatively difficult to transform illegally earned crypto into real economy spending power.
Few merchants accept cryptocurrency, so those sitting on illicit gains must exchange crypto into conventional, or fiat, currencies.
That involves taking foreign exchange risks and then transferring the fiat money through wallet and exchange services into the core banking system.
The end point is a bank account, which is significantly harder to obtain than a crypto wallet.
As a result, criminally obtained cryptocurrency is still mostly contained in terms of real-world spending.
Any big cash-out spree by the dark economy also bears the risk of crashing the entire crypto market, which puts many people off from taking money out.
This is changing.
One of the biggest gateways into the core financial system, the Visa network, is opening itself up to crypto-funded debit cards.
Others have tried to launch such crypto cards before but failed for compliance reasons.
Visa’s latest co-operation with Coinbase for a UK crypto card is different.
The cryptocurrency exchange says the card will allow customers to “spend funds from your cryptocurrency wallets” anywhere Visa is accepted — basically everywhere.
The card’s spending limit starts at a whopping £10,000 a month, rising to £20,000 for customers who meet certain criteria.
This invites the question of how Coinbase was able to satisfy anti-money laundering and “know-your-customer” regulations.
The regulatory environment around crypto has been evolving, and some wallet providers and exchanges now operate with official blessing under specially-devised compliance rules.
But most still exist in regulatory vacuums, and criminals who are technically sophisticated can operate wallets without any oversight at all.
In theory, that means anyone with a Coinbase account has the potential means to receive payments from an illegitimate source with little to no barrier.
Visa says that it subjected this partnership to “enhanced” scrutiny and noted that Coinbase is regulated by US authorities.
Although Coinbase often blocks accounts because of suspicious activity, I find it hard to believe that their system can eliminate risks entirely.
Even if crypto exchanges and wallets comply with know-your-customer rules when someone applies for an account, crypto’s anonymous nature compromises their ability to monitor the legitimacy of transactions from then on.
The only solutions I can see would be for them to routinely block payments derived from wallet addresses hosted by unregulated players or to individually scrutinise all unknown counterparties.
This would incur huge costs and defy the ideological tenets of the crypto movement, which sought to create a parallel and anonymous value network outside of core banking.
Even in the core banking system, the cost and risk of dealing with potentially non-compliant correspondent banks in countries with light-touch regulation has led institutions in places with stricter scrutiny to purge their banking relationships.
If core banks cannot afford such relationships, how is it possible that crypto ones can?
There are already sizeable fees associated with managing crypto exchange and liquidity risk — 2.49 per cent of each transaction in the Coinbase case.
The whole thing risks turning into an uncompetitive luxury service.
Either way, forcing crypto institutions to operate in a similar way to the core banking system is a must if the sector is to be allowed access to the core system via the Visa network.
It’s the only way to maintain a level playing field and insure that 30 years of action against financial crime is not squandered.

Bond and equity markets have been telling stories in recent weeks that were essentially irreconcilable. While stocks exuded relentless optimism, bond yields plummeted in a recession-obsessed nervous swoon. By last week, 10-year US Treasuries were offering yields well below that of three-month bills — an inversion of the normal yield curve that has historically been a good guide to the risk of a recession.
Then equity investors finally twigged with a little help from Donald Trump’s decision to extend the trade war from China to Mexico.
Risk appetite vanished, the debt and equity stories converged and the S&P 500 index ended down more than 6 per cent on the month.
As is usually the case when developed world equities tumble, emerging market equities fall more.
According to the Institute of International Finance, a trade body, the equity outflow from EMs in May of $14.6bn was the biggest since the so-called taper tantrum of June 2013 when incautious rhetoric from former US Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke prompted an outflow of $21.9bn.
The result, overall, is that most of the gains in global equities since the turn of the year have evaporated.
With this whiff of capitulation in the air, could it be time to swim against the tide in equities?
It would not be difficult to make a contrarian case.
Equity outperformance in the first quarter of the year was the product of the Fed’s pivot in a more emollient direction when confronted with weakening global economic data.
At the same time, US-China trade negotiations appeared to be moving closer to some kind of resolution.
With the escalation of the trade war and further signs that global economic growth is flagging, the odds on the Fed cutting rates more than once this year are improving.
As for the trade war, the biggest threat to Donald Trump’s re-election in 2020 is a recession induced by the dispute.
It would thus be bizarre if, after a period of brinkmanship, deals were not cobbled together and a Trumpian “win” declared, regardless of the outcome.
If only it were that easy.
Brinkmanship is dangerous and can get out of control.
There is a risk, too, that Fed rate cuts could weaken the dollar and turn a trade war into a currency war as other countries resort to competitive devaluation to grab a larger share of the global economic cake.
Equally important, economists at the International Monetary Fund reckon that the amount that trade friction subtracts from global GDP comes as much from business and market confidence effects as from the impact of tariffs.
The reality is that Mr Trump has already destroyed much of the institutional underpinning of globalisation.
Also destroyed is the confidence that international business used to derive from the predictable operations of a rules-based system.
In short, we cannot go back to the status quo ante.
A mercantilist cat has been let out of the bag.
The risk is that the world fragments into regional trading blocs, the most obvious ones being the US, the EU and China.
In these blocs, the level of demand and output might not change much with lost export sales being offset by increased demand for domestically produced output.
John Llewellyn of Llewellyn Consulting, points out that it is not obvious that real incomes would fall and costs would rise hugely in these big regional markets because many producers would continue to enjoy the gains from specialisation and economies of scale — not only in production but also in marketing and research and development.
But, he adds, other economies — potentially much of the rest of the world — could suffer considerably because they have little opportunity for economies of scale in production.
Unless such countries could maintain access to at least one of the main markets, output would be scaled down, costs of production and prices would rise and real incomes would suffer.
EMs were the biggest beneficiaries of globalisation over the past 40 or so years.
They will be the biggest victims of the retreat from multilateralism.
Meantime, UK Brexiters’ urge to cut their own trade deals in this brutal new world looks, to put it kindly, quixotic.
For equity markets, the question is whether a world of regional blocs is now a given and how far valuations in different countries reflect this.
On this first question, the answer is very likely.
On the second, definitely not.
Of course, central banks have been able to prop up markets through a period of deglobalisation that predates Mr Trump.
They may do it again.
But the fiscal and monetary tool box is depleted.
Be warned.

China’s stock market was hit by the biggest outflow of foreign capital on record in April and May as the trade war with the US and concerns over the stability of the renminbi darkened investors’ view of the country.
A total of about $12bn left the market during April and May, according to data from CEIC and Morgan Stanley, the largest exodus since the launch five years ago of a “ stock connect” programme that provides global investors with access to Chinese shares, via Hong Kong.
Despite the outflow, China still has a net inflow of about $8bn this year thanks to a strong market performance in the first three months of 2019.
But the sudden reversal of capital flows over the past two months has sparked speculation that the trade war and concerns about the stability of China’s currency are spooking global fund managers.
“Domestic investors [in China] are concerned about whether foreign investors are quitting the market,” said Laura Wang, China equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.
Except for a few small dips in the volume of inbound foreign capital, China has notched continuous inflows from global investors since late 2014.
Even in 2018, one of the country’s worst-performing years on record, about $55bn flowed into China’s equity market.
China’s benchmark CSI 300 stock index fell 25 per cent in 2018.
The index is up about 20 per cent this year but has pulled back significantly from a peak hit in mid-April.
The shift in sentiment has been driven primarily by the intensification of the China-US trade war, which escalated sharply in early May.
China and the US have increased tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of each other’s goods, and have stepped up other provocative measures that have put investors increasingly on edge.
The Trump administration, for example, has sought to cut off Huawei from US suppliers, putting it on a blacklist that essentially bars companies from selling US technology to the Chinese telecoms group.
In retaliation, Beijing has said it would create a list of “non-reliable” foreign companies, and announced an investigation into US logistics group FedEx.
John Zhou, managing director at Shanghai-based asset manager MQ Investment, said the trade war and concerns that China’s currency could weaken beyond Rmb7 to the US dollar were factors driving the foreign outflows.
The exit of foreign investors has been so pronounced over the past two months that the trend is driving even more outflows, Mr Zhou added.
“Their withdrawal exacerbated the volatility of the index which, in turn, triggered further withdrawal of funds,” he said.
Chinese markets are on track for several events this year that could help bring investment back into the market, strategists said.
The MSCI, for example, is in the process of increasing the weighting for Chinese stocks in its emerging markets index, which is expected to generate inflows because foreign investors that track the index will be obliged to allocate more to the country.
“This should provide some support from a flow perspective later this year,” Ms Wang said.

Dealing in white powder usually involves cocaine.
In China, there are big bucks to be made in infant formula too.
Some internet resellers stock up to $130m of foreign baby milk powder.
Beijing wants to increase self-sufficiency by 28 per cent to at least 60 per cent of total sales.
Success or failure will show whether the Chinese trust indigenous businesses with their dearest asset: their children’s health.
The fast-growing middle class have little faith local producers adhere to food standards.
For good reason: in 2008, adulterated local milk took the lives of six babies and sickened more than 300,000.
If China can wean consumers back on to homegrown infant formula, it would hit foreign groups that have benefited.
Shares in Australian milk suppliers, such as a2, Bellamy’s and Bub’s dropped steeply this week.
Nestlé and Danone also participate in China’s $27bn baby formula market.
Scale and diversity protected their shares.
Aussie milk stocks now look oversold.
It will take Chinese producers years to overcome sales resistance.
Collaborations with foreign partners would struggle to win consumers.
Local company Sanlu, now defunct, was at the centre of the 2008 scandal and had a joint venture with New Zealand-based agricultural group Fonterra.
Fakes are another problem.
Even if a local brand were to build up a clean record, counterfeits may hurt its reputation.
Some Australian companies have resorted to microchipping formula cans.
There are also output limitations.
Cow pastures are surprisingly rare in China, despite the vast size of the country.
Many Chinese milk companies rely on numerous small farms.
This drives their production costs higher than for global rivals.
Foreign formula makers and their investors can rest easy.
It is one thing for the government to restrict computer games and mobile networks.
But the authorities cannot force parents to feed their babies on milk they fear may be poisoned.

Donald Trump on Tuesday laid down the battle lines for negotiations on a future US-UK trade deal, insisting that a “phenomenal” agreement was possible but only if Britain’s National Health Service was part of the talks.
The US president, on the second day of a UK state visit, claimed that transatlantic trade between the two countries could be “two and even three times what we’re doing now” after Brexit, but made it clear that it would involve painful choices for Britain.
“Everything will be on the table — the NHS, everything,” Mr Trump said at a joint conference with UK prime minister Theresa May, as he looked ahead to a post-Brexit trade agreement.
The idea of opening up the taxpayer-funded NHS to more US medical companies — the health service already buys in some capabilities from the private sector, including US groups — is highly controversial in Britain.
A trade deal with the US could also potentially involve the NHS having to pay higher prices for drugs made by American companies.
The NHS currently pays significantly less for medicines from US companies than American healthcare purchasers.
Mr Trump’s comments prompted an immediate denunciation from health secretary Matt Hancock, a contender to succeed Mrs May as prime minister, who tweeted: “Dear Mr President. The NHS isn’t on the table in trade talks — and never will be. Not on my watch.”
Other Tory leadership contenders — including the frontrunner Boris Johnson, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and environment secretary Michael Gove — also declared that they would not include the NHS in transatlantic trade talks.
Downing Street said Mrs May shared Mr Hancock’s views, which are widely shared across the political spectrum.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Eurosceptic Conservatives, vying to become Tory leader and implement Brexit, would embark on a policy of “disaster capitalism” once they had weakened links with the EU.
“They all need to understand: our NHS is not for sale,” he added.
The problem facing the Tory MPs seeking to succeed Mrs May— especially those willing to oversee a no-deal Brexit — is that a major US trade deal would be the single largest way of offsetting some of the lost commerce with the EU after Brexit.
In 2017 the US accounted for 18 per cent of UK exports and 11 per cent of its imports, while the EU represented 45 per cent and 53 per cent respectively.
But Washington will demand big concessions, insisting the NHS be opened up to more American companies and that the UK accept US food products such as hormone-treated beef and chlorine-dipped chicken, both currently banned under EU rules.
Downing Street said this week that Britain would not accept any lowering of food or environmental standards when it leaves the EU, creating a further major barrier to a transatlantic trade deal.
Mr Trump struck a generally emollient tone with Mrs May having previously criticised her Brexit negotiations, notably by holding out an olive branch on the vexed issue of Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker.
The UK National Security Council, chaired by Mrs May, tentatively agreed in April to let Huawei build parts of Britain’s fifth-generation mobile phone networks.
But a final decision by the government has been put on hold and is not expected to be taken until after the prime minister leaves office next month.
Washington is concerned that Huawei’s equipment could enable spying by Beijing, and Mr Trump suggested he had been reassured by a promise that the final decision was subject to a “rigorous review” in Whitehall and that British security chiefs would ensure that any participation by the Chinese company in 5G networks did not compromise intelligence sharing between the US and the UK.
Asked if he would limit the sharing of US secrets with its closest ally, Mr Trump said: “No, because we are going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else.
“We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences.”
Washington has barred use of Huawei’s 5G equipment in the US, and is pressing allies to do likewise.
Mr Trump meanwhile used a meeting with US and UK business leaders to raise the importance of close co-operation between the two countries on regulation of key industries, including financial technology, given rising competition from China.
Executives from Goldman Sachs, National Grid, Reckitt Benckiser, Bechtel, BAE Systems, GlaxoSmithKline, JPMorgan and Barclays attended the meeting.
Several companies, including GSK, raised the importance of investment in research and development.
Roger Carr, BAE chair, described it as an “excellent meeting”, adding that “the atmospherics and dynamics were first-class”.

The threat climate change poses to the long-term sustainability of our planet is widely understood and accepted.
The rising levels of awareness and commitment to address the challenge are encouraging.
The Paris climate agreement has 185 signatories and a growing number of countries, as well as companies, have ambitions to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.
That is the good news.
The harder part is that “solving” climate change poses very complex technical and political challenges.
This is clear from the fact that, despite the efforts to date, global emissions continue to grow.
And demand for energy, materials, transport and food will only intensify as the world continues to develop and the population further increases.
Clearly it is essential we invent new ways of doing things that don’t rely on fossil fuels.
For the global steel industry, that means while it continues to reduce its carbon footprint through energy efficiency, ultimately it needs to use an energy source other than coal to extract iron from iron ore, a critical part of the primary steelmaking process.
ArcelorMittal is piloting several new technologies, including carbon capture and the use of alternative energy sources such as renewable carbon and clean energy.
At least one of these initiatives needs to be viable.
As Simon Thompson, chairman of Rio Tinto, noted recently, steel is “essential to human progress” and there are no obvious substitutes for it in a range of applications.
The technology challenge, however, may be the easier part of the problem to solve.
The harder part relates to the political complexities, which are considerable.
In the developed world it can be hard to persuade current generations to make drastic changes, particularly if these threaten jobs, for benefits they are unlikely to see in their lifetime.
No politician in a developing country can pursue policies that threaten economic growth and the fight against poverty.
We are going to have to operate with a mosaic of uneven regional and national approaches and policies for some time to come.
But from this leaders will emerge.
It is imperative they succeed — not only in reducing emissions in their own countries but also in having a positive impact on global emissions.
Unfortunately, the first does not necessarily lead to the second, so there is a major challenge here.
The steel industry is a good example of this dilemma.
As it stands, Europe’s mechanism to reduce emissions, the emissions trading system, is only applicable to steel companies producing in Europe.
Those who export steel to Europe do not bear the same additional cost and, therefore, will gain an important competitive advantage.
As an editorial in this newspaper stated last week: “There is little point shifting to low-carbon energy if the costs of the transition lead to more imports of steel from less green sources.” Doing so would have the opposite effect of actually increasing global CO2 generation, taking us further away from our targets. There are no borders in the sky.
That is why ArcelorMittal is advocating the introduction of a green border adjustment to ensure there is a level playing field between those producing in Europe and those exporting to the continent.
If the world is to successfully address climate change, the answer is not for one region to outsource its carbon footprint to another and claim victory.
Rather, any country or region that wants to play a leading role in reducing global emissions needs policies in place that build a low-carbon industry.
What this means in practice is that lawmakers must create an environment that fosters innovation and ensures a level playing field.
No industry can decarbonise by itself.
There must be collaboration and partnership between political, business and civil society leadership to establish a system that supports and enables sustainable decarbonisation, taking into account the unique economics and drivers for each industry.
For example, much of the progress in the energy sector in Europe has been made through government subsidy and support: by our calculations, an annual subsidy substantially above €50 per tonne of CO2 emissions avoided.
In the case of steel, investment to accelerate innovation, as well as access to clean energy and renewable carbon at competitive prices, will be essential.
Link that to border mechanisms to ensure domestic producers are not rendered uncompetitive and there will be a structure in place to enable the steel industry to decarbonise in line with the Paris agreement.
It is this type of action that will be required if we are to succeed in solving one of the greatest challenges of our age.
I remain optimistic about human beings’ ability to innovate and transform.
But making progress will require a degree of co-operation and foresight, and an acknowledgment that this is a complex global problem.
Unlocking significant contributions from industries like steel will take us all a step nearer to achieving the aspirations set out in Paris in 2015.

We humans like to think of ourselves as reasoning beings, in contrast to other creatures — pigeons or mice, for example.
Yet behavioural science debunks human exceptionalism.
Often we act according to rules of thumb rather than rational calculation.
In embracing this insight, economists are applying lessons long since learnt by advertisers and marketers, and demonstrated anew by digital businesses enticing us with just one more click and then another.
Historian Timothy Snyder argues in a recent essay that digital addiction represents the wiring into our lives of psychologist BF Skinner’s experiments with conditioned behaviour.
Like the Mad Men of Madison Avenue, their Silicon Valley successors are using these techniques to persuade us to buy and browse and click, in their pursuit of profit.
Many digital companies operate an advertising-based business model.
We pay them no money but donate ample time; in return for our attention they earn revenue from advertisers.
Is this a good or bad thing?
There’s some evidence that people place a high value on these free digital goods.
But the corrosive effects of compulsive clicking are evident too.
Economists have trouble evaluating the social cost and benefit of advertising because the way we define economic welfare assumes people have fixed, known preferences and — given those — decide how they want to spend their money.
This standard approach ignores the essence of the ad-based model, namely that people are spending time rather than money.
The point is that nobody has fixed preferences.
We are eminently persuadable, concluding that we do after all want the blouse or the lawnmower or the dog bed for which technology has served us up an ad.
Human desires are highly malleable; many people have a positive taste for novelty.
Economist Nicholas Kaldor made an early attempt in 1950 to consider the economic cost-benefit of advertising.
He weighed the benefit of the provision of information and the creation of jobs and demand against the fact people might end up paying elevated prices for branded goods.
Even before the Mad Men weaponised the business, he was sceptical there was any net benefit to society.
Today, there is no doubt that the online market is opaque, riddled with bots and fraudulent clicks.
A majority of the revenues go to Google and Facebook.
Competition inquiries are under way or likely in several countries.
Yet even if the market were competitive and transparent, there would be reason to believe digital advertising adds nothing to economic welfare — or worse.
One estimate of the dollar value of the provision of free digital goods, calculated by imputing a value accruing to advertisers for people’s attention, found it to be minimal — less than 0.5 per cent of global gross domestic product.
Adding in an estimate of the value of the attention the ads and the click-addiction techniques absorb — the value of our time — would make the cost-benefit calculation decisively negative.
In a services-based economy, the value people derive from how they use their time is a better measure of economic welfare than prices.
With zero-priced digital services, it is all the more important to remember the time cost — not least because everybody’s time budget is strictly limited in a way monetary budgets often are not.
If a much-loved pet were subject to a Skinnerian behavioural experiment to make them obsessively spend several hours a day pressing levers for food, most fond owners would be outraged and put a halt to the practice.
Yet the massive experiment on us is far worse.
It does not rely on natural preferences for necessities but creates new wants, some positive, some harmless, others clearly damaging the fabric of our societies.
Nobel Prize winner Paul Romer has called for a tax on online advertising.
He identifies online targeted ads as the source of socially corrosive behaviours and argues that a tax might shift the digital business models to the old-fashioned one of selling people a service they want to buy.
The Romer tax would be an excellent start to limiting not only the social or civic costs but also the economic time cost to this massive behaviourist experiment.
Competition investigations are another weapon in the policy armoury to limit the harm to economic welfare.
Regulation limiting the amount of online advertising — as with TV advertising — may be needed too.
There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to change preferences and make people buy new goods and services — innovation drives market economies.
But there really is a limit.
And we are well beyond it.

China is now fully part of the global energy trading system, regularly importing more than 9m barrels a day of oil and a rapidly growing amount of natural gas.
But Beijing faces an American assertion of power that threatens to disrupt the current pattern of trade, not least in energy.
The Chinese reaction could reshape markets we take for granted.
The first American action is direct: a war of competing tariffs on trade between the US and China that affect everything from washing machines to rice and even baseballs.
The second is indirect: the US sanctions against Iran that prohibit trade between third countries and Iran including trade in oil.
Initially exemptions on such trade were granted to a number of countries including India and China, but in May the US began withdrawing those exemptions.
The tariff war is the subject of much bluster with threats and counter threats, but given the interests of both economies in maintaining an open trading relationship, it seems reasonable to expect that a deal will eventually be done.
The sanctions issue is more complicated, not least because of the decades of hostility between the US and Iran going back to the 1953 overthrow of the Iranian prime minister Mohammed Mossadeq and the occupation and hostage taking at the US embassy in Tehran between November 1979 and January 1981.
The issue is made more complex by the absence of any obvious mutually acceptable resolution of the question of Iran’s nuclear activity.
Given that US president Donald Trump has rejected the multilateral agreement reached in 2015, it is difficult to see what, short of a full-scale regime change, will satisfy him and his national security adviser John Bolton.
Military action between the US and iran is possible, and even tighter sanctions are more likely.
Seen from Beijing, the problem is that the principal loser from a conflict （in addition to the people of Iran） would be China itself.
Chinese oil imports have risen rapidly during the past decade.
The country may have 2.5m electric vehicles but it also has more than 300m registered vehicles running on diesel and petrol, along with an expanding internal air travel sector.
Oil has become inseparable from economic activity and is essential to satisfying the consumer needs of China’s growing middle class.
Almost half — 44 per cent — of China’s oil imports come from the Middle East.
As the US becomes ever more self-reliant in oil and gas thanks to the shale revolution, the natural destination for Middle East oil is Asia rather than America.
If Iran’s oil trade is cut off — either by sanctions or by a physical conflict that closes the Strait of Hormuz — China will be among the first to feel the implications.
Energy security is now a Chinese issue.
In the short term, China is likely to buy any oil it needs, which would no doubt force up world prices.
The country’s imports unexpectedly rose to more than 10m barrels per day in April, presumably to boost stocks ahead of any crisis, and this almost certainly helped strengthen world prices.
Longer term, the reminder of China’s vulnerability to US actions will focus attention on the challenge of its dependence on outside sources for commodities that have become essential for continued economic success.
The result is likely to be a more mercantilist policy on energy trade.
If an open trading system cannot be replied upon, Beijing will resort to bilateral deals — securing specific supplies of oil, and perhaps gas too, through direct state-to-state barter deals using all the tools it can offer, from cheap loans to political support and the supply of military and other equipment.
Such an approach will go well beyond the limited steps taken so far.
A serious bilateral oil-trade plan would include direct investment and ownership of resources and the accelerated development of Chinese companies into multinationals capable of finding and producing energy resources around the world.
For Beijing, this step is logical and would be a completely understandable response to a US assertion of extraterritorial power over the world market.
For the rest of us the move will be dangerous.
If China ties up 9m or 10m b/d of oil — in April imports reached 10.6m b/d, up 11 per cent on April 2018 — under bilateral deals, the market that remains will be smaller and potentially much more volatile.

Data is now driving the global economy — just look at the list of the world’s most valuable companies.
They collect and exploit the information that users generate through billions of online interactions taking place every day.
But companies are hoarding data too, preventing others, including the users to whom the data relates, from accessing and using it.
This is true of traditional groups such as banks, telcos and utilities, as well as the large digital enterprises that rely on “proprietary” data.
Global and national regulators must address this problem by forcing companies to give users an easy way to share their own data, if they so choose.
This is the logical consequence of personal data belonging to users.
There is also the potential for enormous socio-economic benefits if we can create consent-based free data flows.
We need data-sharing across companies in all sectors in a real time, standardised way — not at a speed and in a format dictated by the companies that stockpile user data.
These new rules should apply to all electronic data generated by users, whether provided directly or observed during their online interactions with any provider, across geographic borders and in any sector.
This could include everything from geolocation history and electricity consumption to recent web searches, pension information or even most recently played songs.
This won’t be easy to achieve in practice, but the good news is that we already have a framework that could be the model for a broader solution.
The UK’s Open Banking system provides a tantalising glimpse of what may be possible.
In Europe, the regulation known as the Payment Services Directive 2 allows banking customers to share data about their transactions with multiple providers via secure, structured IT interfaces.
We are already seeing this unlock new business models and drive competition in digital financial services.
But these rules do not go far enough — they only apply to payments history, and that isn’t enough to push forward a data-driven economic revolution across other sectors of the economy.
We need a global framework with common rules across regions and sectors.
This has already happened in financial services: after the 2008 financial crisis, the G20 strengthened global banking standards and created the Financial Stability Board.
The rules, while not perfect, have delivered uniformity which has strengthened the system.
We need a similar global push for common rules on the use of data.
While it will be difficult to achieve consensus on data, and undoubtedly more difficult still to implement and enforce it, I believe that now is the time to decide what we want. The involvement of the G20 in setting up global standards will be essential to realising the potential that data has to deliver a better world for all of us. There will be complaints about the cost of implementation. I know first hand how expensive it can be to simultaneously open up and protect sensitive core systems. The alternative is siloed data that holds back innovation. There will also be justified concerns that easier data sharing could lead to new user risks. Security must be a non-negotiable principle in designing intercompany interfaces and protecting access to sensitive data. But Open Banking shows that these challenges are resolvable.
The EU has been at the forefront of setting out clear rules for data and the rapidly growing digital economy.
It must continue to champion users, while helping to drive innovation and competition.
The next European Commission should prioritise a cross-sector data-sharing regulation and show how open data can boost innovation, benefiting consumers and businesses.
A comprehensive regulatory framework on data would boost the EU’s overall competitiveness.
The next task would be to lead discussions at the G20, aiming at a much needed global consensus on this matter.

Jay Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has signalled the central bank stood ready to cut interest rates, saying it would “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion” amid the economic impact of escalating trade wars.
“We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved,” he said, in remarks that helped stoke a rally on Wall Street. “We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the US economic outlook.”
Mr Powell was addressing a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, part of a year-long review of how the central bank carries out and communicates its objectives.
Referring to tariffs, which have been raised on imports from China and threatened on those from Mexico, he said the Fed would “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labour market and inflation near our symmetric 2 per cent objective”.
The US economy grew at an annualised rate of more than 3 per cent in the first quarter, but is expected to have slowed in the second three months.
Mr Powell’s speech follows similar comments from other Fed officials, often a sign that the Federal Open Market Committee wants investors to prepare for a shift in policy.
James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis and a voting member of the committee, said on Monday that a rate cut might be “warranted soon” and that current interest rates might be “inappropriately high.”
Richard Clarida, vice-chair of the Federal Reserve, said last week that he was “very attuned” to growth risks, and that the central bank would be “nimble” to keep the economic expansion going.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “I suspect [Mr Powell] goes to bed every night praying for a trade deal, and not just because that would be the best outcome for the country.”
Financial markets indicate it will be almost impossible for the Fed to resist cutting rates this year, with the most likely outcome being two quarter-point reductions by the end of December.
Mr Powell’s comments briefly hit yields on government bonds, especially the two-year Treasury, one of the instruments most sensitive to Fed policy.
Yields have fallen in recent weeks as investors, fearing a slowdown, have sought safety in government debt.
They rebounded yesterday as some of the pessimism dissipated.
The two-year yield fell 4 basis points before resuming its rise as traders concluded the Fed would use potential rate cuts to keep the economy growing.
Equity markets also rebounded sharply.
“The Fed has come out and said they are listening,” said Jon Hill, interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
“They are beginning to pivot from a ‘patient’ stance to a ‘ready to act’ stance. That allows the market to reduce the chance of the worst-case scenario.”

Australia’s central bank has cut its key policy rate for the first time in almost three years on Tuesday, in a move that was widely anticipated by financial markets amid an economic slowdown in the country.
The Reserve Bank of Australia  reduced its cash rate  to a new all-time low of 1.25 per cent from from its previous record low of 1.5 per cent, with Philip Lowe, governor, highlighting subdued inflation and wage growth.
The RBA has held its cash rate steady since August 2016, but calls for a cut have been getting louder.
Every single economist polled by Bloomberg had forecast a for the June meeting, with Lowe indicating a move lower was likely during a  speech in May.
“Today's decision to lower the cash rate will help make further inroads into the spare capacity in the economy. It will assist with faster progress in reducing unemployment and achieve more assured progress towards the inflation target,” Mr Lowe said.
Australia, which has not experienced a recession in almost three decades, reported  lower than expected growth last year, as a steep housing downturn and lacklustre consumer spending ignited broader concerns about the economic outlook.
Earlier on Tuesday, government data showed that retail sales unexpectedly slipped in April, underscoring how the dip in the housing market is rippling through the economy.
Australia’s economy is also under pressure amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China, given it is a major trading partner of both countries.
“The downside risks stemming from the trade disputes have increased,” Mr Lowe said on Tuesday.
Unemployment ticked up to 5.2 per cent in April, from around 5 per cent in previous months, Mr Lowe said on Tuesday.
The RBA maintained its growth outlook at 2.75 per cent for 2019 and 2020.
The Australian dollar strengthened 0.2 per cent against the US dollar following the RBA’s decision to trade at $0.6988.
Analysts are forecasting further cuts in the rest of 2019.
“Already the talk has shifted not to today’s move but what may come later in the year or next and just how far the RBA is willing to go,” said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, who anticipates one more cut in 2019.

Turkey is determined to push on with the purchase of an air defence system from Russia, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday amid a looming crisis with the US over the acquisition.
Speaking in the wake of reports that Ankara could seek a delay in the arrival of the S-400 system, Mr Erdogan said that the plan was going ahead.
“The steps we have taken are clear,” he told reporters after attending prayers for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. “We have made an agreement, and we are determined. There is no question of taking a step back.”
The Turkish president reiterated that he had offered to form a technical committee to examine US concerns that the S-400 would comprise the security of the F-35 fighter jet that is being adopted by a series of Nato member states.
He made no comment as to whether or not that offer had been accepted by the US, despite reports that US President Donald Trump had agreed to the idea during a phone call with Mr Erdogan last week.
US officials have repeatedly warned Turkey that it faces sanctions if it takes delivery of the advanced Russia system — a process that Ankara and Moscow have said could begin as soon as this month.
Congress is expected to mandate Mr Trump to impose punitive measures under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act （CAATSA）, as well as removing Turkey from the F-35 jet programme.

Huawei is selling its undersea telecoms cable business, marking the Chinese group’s first big asset sale since the US began ramping up pressure on the company amid accusations it is a national security risk.
The sale of the majority stake in Huawei Marine Systems comes two weeks after the US placed Huawei on an export blacklist, threatening to cripple the company by cutting it off from suppliers.
Washington has been lobbying its allies to block Huawei from their 5G telecoms systems, accusing the company of being a vehicle for Chinese government spying.
But while the US has been focusing its firepower on 5G, Huawei Marine has grown to become an important player in the world’s undersea cable market, the infrastructure that forms the backbone of the global internet by carrying data between countries.
Huawei Marine has not completely avoided snags, however.
In 2017 Canberra scuttled its efforts to run a cable connecting the Solomon Islands to the global internet after the initiative was red-flagged by the Australian intelligence service.
In a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Monday, Hengtong Optic-Electric, a Chinese manufacturer of communications cables, said it had agreed to buy Huawei’s 51 per cent stake in Huawei Marine Systems, which wholly owns Huawei Marine Networks.
The filing did not disclose the price, but Hengtong said it would pay for the stake in cash and shares.
Huawei Marine, which was established in 2009, has undertaken 90 projects globally and laid 50,361km of cable, according to its website.
In 2018 it contributed Rmb115m （$17m at today’s exchange rate） to group net profits, on revenue of Rmb394m, according to Huawei Technologies’ annual report.
Huawei’s partner in the venture, UK-based Global Marine, was last year put on the bloc.
Its owner, portfolio investor HC2, hired bankers to explore “strategic alternatives, including a potential sale” of the unit.
Global Marine did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Fergus Hanson, head of the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the sale of the undersea cable business reflected a growing awareness among Huawei’s partners of the Chinese group’s toxicity when it comes to winning contracts.
“It’s becoming a more difficult environment when trying to negotiate deals to build cables because [Huawei] is so much in the spotlight,” he said.
Mr Hanson added that by shedding the undersea cable business, Huawei may make itself less of a “one-stop shop” — particularly because undersea cables give access to more than 95 per cent of global internet traffic — and thus help its other businesses.
A 2017 report by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology described Huawei as an “industry leader” in optical communications systems, but warned that China’s optical communications industry lacked self-reliance due to an absence of key component suppliers.
Last month, Washington put Huawei on its “entity list”, a move that threatens to cripple the company because it essentially bars companies from selling it technologies that come from the US.
Huawei has said it relies on about 1,200 US suppliers for semiconductors and other hardware components, as well as crucial software.

Looking back, Rachael Laine thinks the signs pointed towards working with her husband. “We met at a lindy hop lesson,” says the woman who brought the US company Salt-Water sandals to the UK and Europe. “That’s partner dancing. You have to acquiesce or it doesn’t work.”
“But if I didn’t lead you into the moves you wanted to do, you’d get quite cross about it,” interjects her husband, Dave Bull, who recently quit a career in the construction industry to become the operations director at his wife’s distribution business, CraftyMothers.
Ms Laine is adamant he was the best person for a new position she needed to fill.
She felt Mr Bull’s background in quantity surveying — dealing with finances, external contractors and delivering a project — made him a great fit for the company she created nine years ago.
“Is it still nepotism if it’s your husband?” she reflects. “I would never have employed him if I didn’t think he had the skills.”
Plus he knew the business intimately, given that Ms Laine started it from their bedroom in 2011.
The number of couples who are spending their working, as well as family, lives together is significant.
One study by FreeAgent, an accounting software provider, estimated that 1.4m couples run businesses together in the UK.
In the US, the National Federation of Independent Businesses says 43 per cent of small businesses are family-run, in which 53 per cent of managers share day-to-day management with a spouse.
There are risks, however. Jeff Reid, professor of entrepreneurship at Georgetown University, says most professional investors make it a “rule of thumb never to invest in entrepreneurs who are dating or married”. Investors believe the business will suffer if the relationship suffers, he says.
Patricia Bacon set up Couplepreneurs, a support network for couples going into business together, after noticing her previous business consultancy was attracting lots of husband-and-wife teams.
Her recruits come from “all ages and all sectors”.
She says that many clients observe that there is a stigma attached to working with your spouse but Ms Bacon recommends couples highlight the benefits.
“Why should telling people you’re a [couple] be something to feel embarrassed about? Show them your USP, your sales plan, your figures.”
Stew Friedman, a Wharton School of Business professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says running a business with a romantic partner is “complicated” but can include many benefits, the main one being trust.
“A hoped-for shared future brings the understanding that you are in this together for the long run.”
He says managing boundaries between the work relationship and the marriage or family connection is vital.
Gurpreet Singh, a counsellor at UK relationship support group Relate, recommends carving out “alone time” because working together is “tricky territory” to navigate.
“It’s foolish to say problems won’t come up because it is a realigning of a relationship. The power dynamics change when you’re working for your partner,” he says.
Mr Bull joined Craftymothers as an employee rather than an official director, a decision Ms Laine says “shocked” their accountants, given that as a limited company director he could have drawn a dividend rather than a salary, which would have been more tax efficient. “That’s our boundary for now. It’s still my business but Dave is employed at a very senior level.”
They try to keep work and family separate but Ms Laine says one of their children had to step in when they were having “not a fight but a debate from different angles” at home.
Their 10-year old said: “‘No talking business at home,’ and we went, ‘Oh, she’s right. Let’s stop.’”
They have had two “disagreements”, both financial, when Mr Bull overstepped his authority, according to Ms Laine.
“We are finding out the work boundaries. So there are always those little bits of grey,” he adds.
Not that Ms Laine is worried.
“We’re the couple who can put a tent up without killing each other and make flat-pack furniture without ending up with screwdrivers at dawn.”
Tris Mayhew, who started the treetop adventure business Go Ape with his wife Rebecca in 2002, says working together gave them the ultimate flexibility while raising three children. It also stopped him from becoming “bitter and envious” of his wife if she had been the one in charge of the new company while he continued in a corporate job. Mr Mayhew notes that downsides include “less than romantic pillow talk” and the lack of variety that comes from not having separate worlds.
“Most people don’t have that ear to call on at home from someone who is knowledgeable about what they do. We are pretty honest about strengths and weaknesses. Becs told me I needed to step down as managing director, and I said she needed to replace herself as head of marketing,” he adds.
Sky Cracknell, who makes jam with her partner, Kai Knutsen, thinks knowing your other half too well can be an issue. “When things feel difficult in the business, I see my own inadequacies really acutely but also, because Kai and I are hand in hand, I see his inadequacies too, so that’s hard on a relationship,” she says.
The flip side is that creating England Preserves, which has £400,000 in annual sales, together means their roles are interchangeable.
They have two children and have both spent stints at home changing nappies and doing the baby group circuit.
“It would be a nightmare not to be able to job share. Life would be so rigid,” says Mr Knutsen.
Like many couples, the pair, who have equal shares in the company, have not considered what would happen to the business if their relationship failed.
Mike Cherry, national chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, says: “It’s important to have a proper structure in place and defined roles, and of course a succession plan if you go your separate ways.”
For now Ms Laine and her husband seem to have mastered how to transition gracefully between their leadership roles — he leads at the lindy hop, she leads in the office.

Stephen Pereira is calm; his voice is gentle and his speech, precise.
As befits a psychiatrist and cognitive behaviour therapy specialist who attends to City workers’ mental health disorders.
Clients who have gone public about seeing him include Prince William’s brother-in-law James Middleton and the broadcaster Tom Bradby, who described in a recent interview how the insomnia that forced him to take almost five months off from ITV News At Ten was “ten times more frightening” than his experience of being shot.
Dr Pereira was asked to mentor António Horta-Osório, chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, after he received treatment for chronic insomnia in 2011, a condition he likened to torture.
Later Mr Horta-Osório said that Dr Pereira helped him to become “more like a palm tree, so when the storm comes the palm tree bends but then comes back up, instead of being like an oak tree and trying to resist the storm, in which case it can break”.
From his private clinic in London Bridge, just over the river from the Square Mile, Dr Pereira, who trained in psychiatry in Mumbai in the 1980s, and later at the Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital, Oxford university and King’s College London, has seen attitudes towards mental health change in recent years. There is growing acceptance, he says, that mental illness has “parity” with physical problems.
This change is demonstrated by the formation in 2013 of the City Mental Health Alliance, a group of legal firms and financial companies that shares best practice. Today, companies are keen to promote their mental health policies, and encourage senior leaders to talk about their own problems.
Dr Pereira says “there wasn’t open discussion [in the late 1990s when he moved to London] . . . Many corporates now, as compared to then, are taking a more proactive step in talking about mental health. Back in the late nineties, people didn’t even have a properly defined mental health policy at work, and there was very poor training in human resources or employee relations in this space.”
Mental health was the “very, very poor country cousin of the rest of the medical services”, mirrored by government policy that directed money towards cancer and children.
When it came to treating the mind, the attitude, he says, was more likely to be: “Why don’t you just pull up your socks and get on with it?”
There is still some way to go, however.
Good corporate policies do not filter down to the ground.
Often, they are superficial, concealing poor work practices and unsupportive line managers.
Too often, says Dr Pereira, discussions and reporting of mental health lack nuance — it would be unthinkable, he says, to discuss physical health in the same way, as if a heart condition is comparable to stomach pain.
Overworked doctors have developed an over-reliance on prescribing pills for treating anxiety, insomnia and depression, something that Dr Pereira says “has evolved as an unsatisfactory artefact of the system” — one that does not allow doctors much time for their patients who are “in need and therefore some distress”.
Many patients, are prescribed medication, he says, “who do not have biological or clinical depressions but may have . . . depression due to situational factors or life stresses”.
Access to publicly-funded cognitive behavioural therapy is very patchy.
“It turns out to be more like problem-solving sessions rather than proper therapy sessions.”
His private practice started as intellectual — and presumably, financial — relief from his work that helped people with severe mental illness, having set up in 1996, together with a couple of colleagues, the National Association of Psychiatric Intensive Care Units. “That was really heavy duty work,” he reflects.
Over the decades, Dr Pereira has seen “very many more people with anxiety disorders, with panic related disorders, with relationship difficulties, with sleep difficulties and with drinking”.
It is difficult to discern whether this reflects increased problems or just growing awareness of the issue.
As Scott Stossel, author of My Age of Anxiety, writes: “trying to directly compare levels of anxiety between eras is a fool’s errand. Modern poll data and statistics about rising and falling levels of tranquilliser use aside, there is no magical anxiety meter that can transcend the cultural particularities of place and time.”
City workers are not the cokeheads of popular mythology, Dr Pereira says.
However, self-medicating with alcohol is a problem.
“You start off with one glass of wine per day and then there comes a point when you require one bottle a day, or two, to achieve the same effect.”
Bouts of stress or nerves, before a presentation for example, are not necessarily debilitating. “Stress is not a dirty word. Everyone recognises the flutters,” he says. Where it becomes problematic is when it becomes severe, perhaps leading to panic attacks.
Poor management can aggravate employees’ mental health. “Many people in the City are promoted on the basis of their ability, their skill to generate revenue or to deliver on a particular project.” They are not necessarily equipped to manage others’ behaviour and emotions.
The unrelenting pace of City working is also damaging. “You don’t race a racehorse every single day of the year. When you put [employees] into one project after the other after the other without resting them in between, deliberately so, then you land up with . . . stress.” The prevailing attitude, Dr Pereira says, is that employees are replaceable. “If this cohort of racehorses are burnt out, we’ll get the next cohort of racehorses. But there’s so much time, effort, energy and money that is lost in terms of valuable experience and resources.”
Dr Pereira has seen various CEOs with stress-related issues. “By the time you get to be a CEO, one can develop blind spots. And then not being aware of those blind spots . . . can then become an impediment.” Fixing these is important, he says, because hiring a CEO is expensive and their decisions affect thousands of employees. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he argues that CEOs need mentoring from someone with psychological training.
Overall, prevention rather than cure is his goal.
Dr Pereira believes that programmes such as “Optimal Leadership Resilience”, a course he helped devise at Lloyds, are the best strategy, equipping staff with psychological resilience and strategies to identify signs of stress.
Mr Horta-Osório says he wanted to work with Dr Pereira and his team of psychologists to design a programme that would help leaders to build better awareness about their mental health and adopt better habits.
While the bank still has “a great deal to do”, he says that so far, efforts have led to “real, measurable progress” and the ambition is to continue to “encourage open, honest conversations on the topic”.
So far, 200 senior leaders at Lloyds have been through the year-long programme.
The course includes personality inventories, development goals and self-reflection.
There is also nutritional analysis, physiological monitoring, and resilience and mindfulness workshops.
Lloyds is launching training based on the programme to 2,000 managers.
Dr Pereira wants companies to move away from “tick box” services to focus on prevention, encouraging employees to foster good mental health before problems become acute.
“By the time [workers are] referred to me, the horses have bolted the stable doors,” he says.

Sydney-based infant formula maker a2 Milk lost A$930m （US$650m） in market value yesterday following a pledge by Beijing to increase the proportion of domestically manufactured baby milk powder sold in China, a crucial market for global dairy companies.
China’s top planning body on Monday laid out a plan to increase domestically produced formula’s share of the overall market to 60 per cent, without giving a timeframe.
Analysts estimate that the current share of domestic powder is around 40 per cent.
Six of the top 10 brands in China are foreign, according to consultancy Euromonitor, with European companies the largest players.
Nestlé had a 14 per cent share of sales last year, while Danone accounted for 10 per cent.
Chinese consumers embraced imported infant formula following a 2008 scandal in which locally produced milk powder tainted by melamine, an industrial chemical, killed several children and made tens of thousands of others ill.
Milk is also cheaper to produce in countries such as Australia due to a shortage of suitable land in China, making it more difficult for domestic producers to compete.
“It will be tough to meet the 60 per cent target due to the expense of local production and because consumers lack trust in domestically produced powder,” said independent dairy industry analyst Song Liang.
Mr Song said China’s wholesale infant formula market was worth $15bn last year, of which about $8.7bn was imported.
The support plan rolled out by China’s National Development and Reform Commission would involve financing channels for domestic producers and encouraging them to invest overseas to improve their technology.
The NDRC added that it would “promote fair competition between domestically made infant formula and imported products”.
The directive does not completely exclude overseas companies, as they could benefit by moving their final-stage formula production to China.
But such a transition would be difficult as “overseas companies still mainly access the market by imports,” said Mr Song.
Shares in a2, which was founded in New Zealand and claims a 5 per cent share of China’s infant formula market, fell 8.6 per cent in Sydney yesterday.
Shares in rival milk powder maker Bellamy’s Australia fell 5.3 per cent.
Last year a2 saw its revenue in China and other Asian markets grow 163 per cent to A$233.6m.

China has warned its students and scholars that they face growing difficulties in visiting the US, as the escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies spills into the broader bilateral relationship.
“Visa issuances for Chinese students studying in the United States have been restricted. The visa review period has been extended, the validity period has been shortened, and the refusal rate has increased,” the Chinese education ministry said on Monday, just ahead of the busy summer season for US visa applications.
“This has affected the Chinese students in the United States normally or successfully completing their studies in the United States.”
The ministry urged Chinese parents to make more careful assessments of the risks of planning US visits.
After negotiators failed to reach a trade deal in early May, both sides have escalated their tactics.
The US has blacklisted Chinese telecoms company Huawei while the Chinese government responded with an “ unreliable entities list” against companies that discriminate against Chinese firms.
Both countries assessed additional punitive tariffs against each others’ exports this month.
To date, the tariffs have had minimal tangible effect on most citizens’ lives in either country, but a new climate of recriminations could change that.
Millions of Chinese have lived or studied in the US, and hundreds of thousands currently attend US high schools, colleges and graduate schools.
Application volumes for the top 30-50 US institutions are rising steadily.
“Parents who read this are really scared,” said Tomer Rothschild, co-founder of independent education consultancy Elite Scholars of China, who was deluged by parents seeking reassurance after the Ministry of Education’s warning on Monday. “Parents have been planning [to send their child abroad] for a long time.”
The US embassy in Beijing declined immediately to comment.
Despite the alarm generated by the warning, statistics show that the majority of Chinese students travel to the US smoothly.
According to statistics offered from the education ministry on Monday, among the more than 10,000 Chinese whose studies in the US were sponsored by the Chinese government in 2018, 331 people were unable to do so because of a visa issue.
In the first quarter of this year, 182 people out of the 1,353 sponsored by the government had an unresolvable visa issue.
That compares with over 100,000 Chinese students enrolled in US universities in 2018.
The warning comes after Washington rescinded 10-year visas held by some prominent Chinese scholars, and urged US universities to guard their laboratories more firmly against Chinese students trying to steal technology.
But even China hawks have been reluctant to block Chinese student visas more broadly because of the importance of Chinese students to US university budgets.
The warning plays into the feeling among some young Chinese that America is turning against them.
“Studying abroad is a dream. For some people today, the American visa process has become like a needle in their hearts,” DeepTech, a Chinese news service affiliated with MIT Tech Review, wrote on Monday, in a report on a Chinese student waiting six months for a US visa.
Mindful of the sentiment, Chinese president Xi Jinping positioned himself as a defender of Chinese students abroad in a speech to the Belt and Road conference in Beijing in late April.
“We also hope that every country in the world could create a good environment for investments, to fairly treat Chinese companies, Chinese overseas students and scholars and create an equal and friendly environment for their activities of international co-operation,” he said.

South Korea’s economy shrank more than previously estimated in the first three months of 2019, according to revised official figures, dragged down by slowing global demand for electronics.
The country’s gross domestic product decreased by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter compared to the previous period, according to the Bank of Korea, down from the advanced estimate of a 0.3 per cent fall, which was the largest drop since 2008.
A 3.3 per cent drop in manufacturing thanks to lower production of electronics contributed to the overall fall.
South Korea’s high-tech industry has been hit by slowing global demand for  semiconductors  and uncertainty sparked by the US-China trade war.
Exports from the country fell 3.2 per cent,  led by a drop in shipments of LCDs and semiconductors, the central bank said.
In year-on-year terms, South Korean GDP grew 1.7 per cent, down from the 1.8 per cent advance estimate.
Separately, figures released on Tuesday showed consumer prices rose 0.7 per cent year on year in May, picking up pace from the 0.6 per cent growth seen in the previous month.

The financial markets have become extremely focused on the twists and turns in the tariff negotiations involving the US and China and, more recently, on the likelihood of a technology war centred around US sanctions against Huawei.
Trade wars first assumed a central role in market psychology in the final quarter of 2018, when a deterioration in US-China trade relations coincided with a collapse in stock markets across the world. In recent weeks, there have been signs that the same might happen again.
Former US Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers has commented that this is a puzzle, because macroeconomic models indicate that the direct economic effects of tariff increases are likely to be rather small and certainly not enough to explain such large gyrations in equity markets.
His explanation is that the markets are not focused solely on tariff effects, but on the rising probability of a big economic and strategic confrontation between the world’s two largest economies, which could eventually extend well beyond trade in manufactured goods.
Many of the benefits to global growth that have stemmed from decades of globalisation might be reversed in the worst scenarios.
I have some sympathy with Prof Summers’ suggestion.
Markets seem to be reacting to changes in tail risks, rather than central scenarios.
However, there is an alternative explanation, which is that collapsing US markets late last year were not reacting entirely, or even mainly, to trade war shocks, but to other unexpected economic developments.
This alternative is supported by the fact that the latest, and most serious, exacerbation of trade wars in early May has been accompanied by a moderate decline of about 6 per cent in US stocks, much smaller, so far, than the meltdown last December.
Measuring trade war uncertainty
Fulcrum economists have calculated a weekly index of tariff and trade war shocks that is derived simply from the number of Google searches for these terms since 2016.
Although crude, this measure is appropriate, provided that the index is correlated with the true （unobservable） measure of trade uncertainty （see box）.
There have been five large spikes in trade uncertainty since March 2018.
Surprisingly, our initial econometric tests have failed to support any systematic relationship between the trade uncertainty index and changes in market prices.
This suggests that investors may be paying too much attention to trade wars, but we need to do more work to be certain about that.
Watch this space.
The deterioration in US/China relations in May has caused the largest spike so far in the trade uncertainty index.
This makes sense, since the latest episode has involved threats of much larger US tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports than seen last year, and also a widening in the conflict to include direct sanctions against Huawei, the largest Chinese IT supplier.
In response, Chinese negotiators appear to have adopted a more hawkish tone than before, including veiled threats about sales of US Treasuries and restrictions on the supply of rare earth minerals to the US.
Trade v other shocks
Another Fulcrum model （explained here） enables us to examine the shocks that have been driving the S&P 500 index since last October.
The key point is that the US market plunge in 2019 Q4 was driven by a combination of several different economic shocks, while the trade event of May 2019 has not been accompanied by other adverse shocks.
The model identifies major negative shocks in the fourth quarter of 2018 from US domestic demand, foreign demand, risk aversion and, importantly, a tightening in monetary policy.
Some of these variables may have been partly connected to trade war shocks but this is very difficult to prove.
The most important variable — tighter monetary policy — occurred because the US Federal Reserve persisted with hawkish guidance about increases in interest rates, despite deteriorating economic conditions, and falling markets.
The FOMC seems to have learnt a painful lesson from this error of judgment and communication, and has quickly softened its forward guidance on its policy stance as its perceptions of downside risks have changed.
Conclusion
There are three conclusions to draw from this:
Markets are reacting to changing tail risks of extreme outcomes not to changes in central forecasts.
The reaction of markets to trade wars is not consistent through time.
The latest episode may have increased tail risks more than last year’s outbreaks of trade wars, but developed markets have reacted less than before.
This is mainly because there has been no negative monetary shock from the Federal Reserve this time.
Provided the Fed remains dovish, developed markets should weather the trade storm better than they did last year.

China UnionPay, the world’s biggest card issuer, is to start offering debit and credit cards in Europe for the first time as the Chinese state-controlled giant continues its global expansion to challenge Visa and Mastercard.
UnionPay, which has issued more than 6bn cards in China, has partnered with Tribe Payments, a new UK-based back-office technology start-up, to allow banks and fintechs to start offering individuals and companies its branded cards from this month.
“This agreement shows UnionPay’s intent to compete with the major card schemes in Europe,” said Suresh Vaghjiani, the founder of Tribe. “This is the first time European institutions will be able to put UnionPay cards into the hands of people on the street.”
Mr Vaghjiani says Tribe so far has two clients interested in UnionPay’s services, one for a virtual card in Europe and another for a debit card in the UK.
He declined to name them.
“European corporate clients that do business in China will now be able to use UnionPay cards there, while Chinese businesses in Europe will have a consistent payment method at home and abroad,” Mr Vaghjiani added.
Founded in 2002 under a charter from the People’s Bank of China, UnionPay has a virtual monopoly on domestic bank card payments, where it has issued more cards than Visa and Mastercard combined.
The Chinese group has been expanding internationally in recent years, mainly in Asia, and says its cards are accepted by more than 41m merchants and 2m ATMs in 170 countries, 40 of which are in Europe.
“We have the largest cardholder base in the world, working with issuers through Tribe is important to our growth,” said Zhihong Wei, head of UnionPay in Europe.
It first moved into the continent a decade ago to provide access for Chinese tourists and its cards are now accepted by 60 per cent of merchants and ATMs in the region.
Seven years ago London department store Harrods installed a UnionPay point-of-sale terminal, prompting a surge in sales from Chinese students and tourists who were able to spend directly from their home bank accounts.
UnionPay’s new move comes amid intensifying competition in its home market from digital payments groups such as Ant Financial’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay.
The two have dislodged UnionPay from its dominant position online, robbing it of fee income and valuable transaction data from consumers who have switched from traditional plastic to mobile phones.
Mr Wei told the Financial Times in September the company did not need a licence for its European expansion plan as its cards will be issued by third parties, such as banks and fintechs, and its transactions will be handled by payment processing groups like Tribe.
Tribe employs 72 people, has an office in London’s Shard and outposts in Lithuania and Denmark.
Mr Vaghjiani previously ran another payments processor called Global Processing Services and has worked on systems for Monzo and Revolut.
While UnionPay expands overseas, US rivals Visa and Mastercard have been repeatedly frustrated in their attempts to enter the huge Chinese market. Both have applied to Beijing for licences to clear renminbi payments, but the central bank has refused to acknowledge them. This is despite a World Trade Organization ruling six years ago that China discriminates against foreign payment groups.
UnionPay operates a similar business model to Visa and Mastercard, earning a commission on each card swipe.
The currency-printing unit of the People’s Bank of China is its largest shareholder, with most of the remaining equity held by other state-owned financial institutions.

Last year Kate Crawford, a New York University professor who runs an artificial intelligence research centre, set out to study the “black box” of processes that exist around the hugely popular Amazon Echo device.
Crawford did not do what you might expect when approaching AI — namely, study algorithms, computing systems and suchlike.
Instead, she teamed up with Vladan Joler, a Serbian academic, to map the supply chains, raw materials, data and labour that underpin Alexa, the AI agent that Echo’s users talk to.
It was a daunting process — so much so that Joler and Crawford admit that their map, Anatomy of an AI System, is just a first step.
The results are both chilling and challenging.
For what the map shows is that contemporary western society is blind to the real price of its thirst for technology.
We rely heavily on digital gadgets and often view them as miracles of disembodied progress.
AI seems so sophisticated that we talk as if it is untethered from the “real” — tangible — world.
But Crawford and Joler argue that nothing could be further from the truth: tech gadgets and AI cannot function without massive amounts of energy and hard-to-extract minerals, the supply of which comes at a high environmental price.
There is a hefty human cost too, paid by the army of contract workers who assist with machine learning by tagging content and parsing images.
“Each small moment of convenience [with Alexa] — be it answering a question, turning on a light or playing a song — requires a vast planetary network, fuelled by the extraction of non-renewable materials, labour and data,” Crawford and Joler write. “A full accounting for these costs is almost impossible but it is increasingly important that we grasp the scale and scope if we are to understand and govern the technical infrastructures that thread through our lives.”
Other researchers are also exploring this territory.
Take Mary Gray and Siddarth Suri, respectively an anthropologist and computer scientist based at a research unit of Microsoft.
They have recently tried to document the lives of the “ghost workers” who play a crucial, but largely unheralded, role at tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft by moderating content, answering queries, maintaining websites and carrying out other routine tasks.
Like Crawford and Joler, Gray and Suri found it extraordinarily difficult to undertake this study.
Last month, though, they published their findings in a book, Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass.
The scale of what they describe is startling.
So are the poor conditions that the work involves.
But what is still more striking is how little we talk about these hidden millions of toilers.
When we think of “tech workers”, we tend to think of high-status Silicon Valley geeks; we rarely discuss all the Indians and Filipinos who log on each day to perform functions that are vital to the smooth running of Alexa and other AI.
Why?
Geography is partly to blame: rare-earth metals are mined half a world away from western consumers, in places such as Jiangxi, China, or Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia.
As such, it is all too easy to overlook the environmental costs or labour conditions.
Similarly, many of Gray and Suri’s ghost workers are based in parts of the developing world that are far from western eyes.
Global supply chains are so complex that even tech giants struggle to understand them.
“One illustration of the difficulty of investigating and tracking the contemporary production chain process is that it took Intel more than four years to understand its supply line well enough to ensure that no tantalum [a rare metal] from the Congo was in its microprocessor products,” Crawford and Joler observe.
However, I would posit that there is another problem: culture.
In some senses, it seems unsurprising that we are so blind to the exploitative patterns in modern tech.
Our western consumer culture is equally blind to the grubby underbelly of global supply chains in “tangible” goods such as fashion and food.
But I suspect that the seemingly disembodied nature of tech makes us doubly myopic, since we have been persuaded to think that AI almost “floats” above humans and earth.
It might be tempting to assume that the lack of transparency is a deliberate plot concocted by tech billionaires.
But those Silicon Valley executives are themselves hampered by tunnel vision and blind spots.
In tech （as in finance or other parts of our lives） so much is hidden in plain sight; or, at least, could be seen if only we looked.
So here are two modest proposals.
First, anybody who relies on a modern cyber gadget should spend a few moments looking at that Alexa map, if only to marvel at the complexity behind the devices in our hands.
Second, Alexa （and virtual assistants） should be taught to “answer” questions about that global supply chain — if asked.
Yes, Amazon might hate that idea （and it is not clear how many people might actually ask）.
But if we had an Alexa that could answer the question: “What really enables you to operate?” that would be a small step in the right direction.
Even better would be an honest answer.

Wall Street slid in midday trading on Monday, while government bonds and other haven assets rose as escalating economic tensions between the US and China spurred a rush for safety.
US stocks suffered under the weight of a sell-off in technology shares that fell amid antitrust scrutiny of Alphabet and Facebook, whose shares tumbled 6.8 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively.
The S&P 500 shed gains seen in morning trade to fall 0.6 per cent.
The communications services sector, which counts Facebook and Google owner Alphabet among its members, slipped 3.1 per cent.
The tech sector was down 0.9 per cent.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite retreated 1.5 per cent, putting it on pace to close in correction territory — defined as a drop of 10 per cent or more from its recent peak.
However, market sentiment improved in Europe.
The continent-wide Stoxx 600 recovered from earlier losses to trade 0.4 per cent higher.
Germany’s Dax rose 0.6 per cent, and the FTSE 100 was up 0.3 per cent.
Global stocks suffered their worst month of the year in May as trade tensions amplified global growth concerns, sending investors piling into the government bond market.
US sovereign bonds continued their rally on Monday, with 10-year Treasury yields briefly falling below 2.1 per cent for the first time since 2017.
China stepped up its counter-offensive in the trade conflict over the weekend, announcing it would establish a blacklist of foreign companies that harm the interest of Chinese groups, while separately state media reported that Beijing was investigating FedEx.
“The series of actions over the weekend means that China’s ‘long march’ has begun,” said Iris Pang, economist on Greater China for ING. “We take this seriously. It means that the trade war has not only become a technology war but also a broad-based business war.”
On Monday, the stand-off spilled into other sectors, as China’s Ministry of Education issued a warning to students and scholars who plan to visit the US.
European banks suffered, as low interest rates typically impact their profitability.
The Stoxx index tracking the sector fell 0.5 per cent, with Deutsche Bank hitting a new record low.
Japan’s Topix was down 0.9 per cent to its lowest level since the start of January, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 shed 1.2 per cent.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was flat, and the CSI 300 of Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks rose 0.1 per cent.
Concerns over trade tensions spread beyond equities markets. The yen, which is seen as a haven in times of uncertainty, was mostly flat on the day but holding around its strongest level against the dollar since mid-January, and gold climbed 1.3 per cent to hit a two-month high.
Investors reacted with dismay at the end of last week when Donald Trump opened up another trade front by threatening tariffs on Mexico over migration. Neil Mackinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, said: “Policy volatility translates into market volatility and, not surprisingly, incentivises real-money investors to adopt defensive portfolio decisions.”
Weak UK manufacturing surveys barely nudged the Brexit-focused pound, which held above $1.26.

America’s business executives are struggling to figure out how the global trading system will be reshaped by Donald Trump’s policies after his decision last week to open a second front in his trade war by targeting Mexico.
The US president’s plan to use tariffs against Mexico in retaliation for illegal immigration has prompted a realisation among businesses and markets that his past decisions to levy tariffs, for example on steel and aluminium, were not simply negotiating tactics towards broader strategic goals, analysts say.
“The market would like to believe the president is crying wolf on tariffs, but he isn’t,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. Companies were now “walking on eggshells”.
Federal Reserve officials have been flagging trade tensions as a threat to growth for more than a year but US business has been slow to catch up.
For many investors, Mr Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on Mexican imports marks an alarming turning point.
Mexico is highly integrated into America’s critical auto market, with components often crossing their border multiple times, potentially subjecting them to repeated tariffs.
Mexico was also the biggest national exporter of goods to the US last year after China, which ships goods worth more than $500bn a year to America.
That means vast quantities of merchandise could be affected if Mr Trump raises the tariffs, as he has threatened to do, even at the risk of significant economic and financial market disruption.
Following sharp moves in the financial markets on Friday, investors are now placing significant odds on a US recession as they fret about the president’s willingness to pursue an increasingly antagonistic agenda.
Seth Carpenter, US economist at UBS, said investors had woken up to tariffs remaining a “tool of choice” for the Trump administration.
“The penny dropped,” he said.
Shares continued to slip this week as investors digested the growing economic threat, which has been signalled by a succession of Fed officials. Richard Clarida, vice-chairman of the Fed’s board, kicked things off last week, saying the central bank needed to be “nimble” in its efforts to extend the economic expansion, citing global growth risks as a possible trigger for a rate cut. Jim Bullard, president of the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank, then warned on Monday a rate reduction might be needed “soon” given trade disputes and low inflation expectations, followed yesterday by Fed chair Jay Powell who said the US central bank stood ready to “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion” as it monitored the impact of trade wars.
If all the threatened tariffs on Mexico and China were implemented, the boost to US core inflation could peak at 1.25 percentage points, according to Goldman Sachs, hitting consumers’ spending power.
The investment bank has shaved back its US growth forecast for the second half of this year by half a percentage point, to 2 per cent.
Others are pessimistic. More than two-thirds of chief financial officers surveyed by Duke University expect a recession by the third quarter of next year, according to a poll in April.
That poll came weeks before the president’s announcement in early May that he would boost tariffs to 25 per cent on $200bn of Chinese products, as well as America’s most recent actions against Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment company, and the move against Mexico.
Mr Graham said investors and businesses were asking “is it going to be a nonstop trade war for the next couple of years?”
Judging from movements in bonds and equities, the markets are pricing in a 37 per cent probability of recession, said Roberto Perli of Cornerstone Macro.
He described those odds as high, but not yet alarming.
Ominously, however, Friday’s move in expectations for Fed policy was akin to those seen in times of financial crisis as investors price in higher odds of rate cuts.
In an interview on Monday, Kevin Hassett, the outgoing chairman of Mr Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, said economic models based on hard data rather than financial market prices were not pointing to a recession, and that in any case the bond market might be driven more by the risk of low global inflation than a possible downturn.

Investors are betting that the US Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy as soon as next month, after a top official at the central bank admitted that market signals indicated that interest rates might be “inappropriately high”.
The Fed has planned to hold its current interest rate corridor steady at 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent through 2019, but investors have increasingly been speculating that slower economic growth could force it to cut rates before the end of the year.
Those expectations have been fanned by the US government’s recent decision to open up a two-front trade war with China and Mexico, leading economists to sharply mark down their forecasts for economic growth this year.
Most policymakers have been wary of talking up the prospects of rate cuts, but on Monday James Bullard, head of the St Louis Fed and a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said lower interest rates might be “warranted soon”, citing trade war risks, slowing global growth and the lack of inflationary pressure in the US.
“The FOMC faces an economy that is expected to grow more slowly going forward, with some risk that the slowdown could be sharper than expected due to ongoing global trade regime uncertainty,” Mr Bullard said in a speech. “In addition, both inflation and inflation expectations remain below target, and signals from the Treasury yield curve seem to suggest that the current policy rate setting is inappropriately high.
“A downward policy rate adjustment may be warranted soon to help re-centre inflation and inflation expectations at target and also to provide some insurance in case of a sharper-than-expected slowdown,” he argued.
The comments sent a jolt through the Treasury market, with the interest rate-sensitive two-year US government bond yield tumbling another 7 basis points to a one-and-a-half year low of 1.86 per cent.
In mid-November it peaked at nearly 3 per cent, and it stood at about 2.5 per cent just a few months ago.
The recent rally is the strongest since October 2008.
The 10-year Treasury yield declined 6bp and is flirting with the 2 per cent mark for the first time since mid-2017.
Traders are now for the first time betting that there is a greater-than-even probability that the Fed will trim interest rates as soon as its July meeting, according to Fed funds futures — derivatives contracts that investors use to wager on or hedge against interest movements.
At the start of May, the Fed funds futures market indicated only a 19 per cent chance of a cut in July.
Moreover, these interest rate derivatives indicate that investors see no chance of the Fed staying on hold through 2019, and that the most likely outcome is that the central bank cuts interest rates at least twice this year.
There is even a 15 per cent implied chance of four cuts, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Mr Bullard is considered one of the Fed’s dovish members, but his comments are still notable as they mark the first time a Fed official has explicitly said a rate cut may be needed this year.
Richard Clarida, the Fed’s vice-chair, said last week that the Fed was “very attuned” to the looming risks and vowed that the central bank would be “nimble” in ensuring that the US economic expansion continued, but stopped short of indicating that a rate cut was coming soon.
JPMorgan now sees a 43 per cent chance the US will enter a recession over the next 12 months — and predicts rate cuts in September and December — while Morgan Stanley on Monday warned the US market cycle had shifted from an expansionary phase to a “ downturn” for the first time since 2007.
Sentiment was not helped by disappointing data out on Monday on US manufacturing activity.

Taiwan’s armed forces wrapped up their Han Kuang military exercises last week — the annual war-games aimed at simulating an invasion by China — with live-fire drills, air raid defence rehearsals and an amphibious landing on the southern tip of the island.
The drills were held against a backdrop of rising anxiety among Taiwanese buffeted by a slowing economy and rising pressure from Beijing, which at the weekend reasserted its determination to defend “at all costs” its claimed sovereignty over Taiwan, a de facto independent state, at the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore.
Amanda Chao, a normally cheerful 26-year-old interior designer, is typical of a younger generation concerned that Taiwan will be sucked in by its big, bullying neighbour.
“I do worry,” she said. “I am all right with my job now and I can do it for two to three years but it will be very difficult to earn more money in the long run, there are just not enough opportunities here.
“We will be ‘unified’ sooner or later — by the means of information or by economic means.”
As half a dozen politicians gear up to run in the most unpredictable presidential race in recent memory, fierce infighting in Taiwan’s two main parties over who will stand has only added to these anxieties.
Terry Gou, the founder and chairman of Apple’s main supplier Foxconn, has joined a crowded field of politicians who will contest the primaries for the opposition Kuomintang （KMT） in July.
Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, faces an unprecedented challenge for nomination of her Democratic Progressive party （DPP） from William Lai, her former premier.
Politicians from the KMT, a party that was founded in China and ruled Taiwan for 40 years after fleeing to the island in the wake of defeat in the Chinese civil war of 1949, push the narrative that Taiwan has lost its economic edge and risks war if it refuses to compromise with Beijing.
“There is a deep sense of anxiety,” said Chen Lu-huei, a research fellow at the Election Study Centre of National Chengchi University. “Many young people feel they have no economic future here. Meanwhile, China’s moves to isolate us internationally and their military aircraft frequently circling Taiwan is making fears of war more acute.”
Gross domestic product growth slowed sharply in the first quarter due to the global downturn in the technology industry, the sector the export-reliant economy depends on most.
Stagnating incomes, especially for Taiwanese university graduates, are prompting increasing numbers to study or work in China.
The Chinese Communist party is luring students and young professionals with lower university entry scores and preferential residency rights.
Mr Gou is trying to tap into the economic “no future” narrative.
“I have four grandchildren and three children in Taiwan. What is their future?” he said when he launched his presidential bid last month.
Many Taiwanese see the economic pain as a sign of weakness compared with China — a neighbour which they used to regard as backward and which some now feel is overtaking them.
Such worries come against a backdrop of fear over their country’s political future.
Although the vast majority of Taiwanese oppose unification with China, a growing number of them now think that it might become unavoidable.
Analysts say such views are driven by the increasing pressure Beijing has been putting on Taiwan since Ms Tsai took office in 2016 and the perception that Taipei cannot count on the international community to safeguard it from annexation.
In a January poll for the Taiwan National Security Survey, an annual analysis Duke University has been conducting since 2002, 48.1 per cent of respondents said unification was the more likely future scenario for Taiwan while only 29.6 per cent believed independence was more likely.
Ms Tsai’s stand-off with Mr Lai over the DPP nomination, which has raised the spectre of a party split, has triggered worries among independence supporters.
Many of them now regularly greet each other on social media with the phrase: “I have such a strong feeling of national ruin!”
However, many young people are simply fed up with the two big parties’ rhetoric.
Mr Gou is only the latest of a smattering of populist candidates that appear set to break the mould of traditional politics.
Once the DPP and KMT have picked their candidates, Ko Wen-je, the independent mayor of Taipei, is also set to decide whether to join the race.
According to National Chengchi University’s Mr Chen, Mr Ko beats any other candidate in opinion polls by a wide margin among young voters.
“Many politicians’ moves are for their own benefit and not for the sake of the people, and that results in slowing down our development,” said Yang Shih-wei, a Taipei student who will be able to vote for the first time next year. “No doubt, China has a huge influence on Taiwan. And it doesn’t help that the two big parties’ positions [on China] are diametrically opposed. In the political fights over this, they are wasting a lot of time and creating a lot of problems.”

China has warned its citizens of the risks of travelling to the US, where they face being “repeatedly harassed” by law enforcement agencies, in an escalation of strains between the two powers.
“Recently, US law enforcement agencies have repeatedly harassed Chinese nationals travelling to the US through border interrogations, drop-in visits and various other means,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on its official social media feed yesterday.
The same day, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism posted a travel warning in which it said “recently, gun shootings, robberies and thefts have occurred frequently in the United States”, according to state media.
The US and China are in the midst of an intensifying trade conflict that has spilled over into broader political problems.
Last month, the US in effect banned American suppliers from exporting to Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment company, and Beijing responded by announcing it would draw up a blacklist of US companies.
The travel warnings came in the wake of a shooting in Virginia Beach on Friday in which 12 people were killed, according to US media reports.
US embassies and consulates in China flew their flags at half-mast, a gesture that was misinterpreted in some sections of the media as a commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, which fell yesterday.
On Monday, Beijing warned Chinese students and scholars that they face ever-higher obstacles in getting US visas, while also telling parents to carefully assess the risks of visiting the US.
Executives at big Chinese companies, as well as academics, have been barred from visiting the US in recent months as a result of more stringent visa requirements.
A year ago, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a detailed travel warning in which it made reference to “expensive” medical care and the risk of gun crime.
Last year 3m Chinese nationals visited the US and spent $36.4bn, making China the US’s biggest source of travel exports and the fifth-biggest source of tourists, according to the US National Travel and Tourism Office.
Last December, following the detention of two Canadian nationals by Chinese police, the US considered warning its citizens about increased risks when travelling to China.
Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, one of the two detained, continues to be denied access to legal representation.
Mr Kovrig and Michael Spavor were formally charged last month with gathering state secrets.
The Canadians were detained shortly after Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, was arrested by authorities in Vancouver pending extradition to the US.

Kim Yong Chol, a top aide to Kim Jong Un, has attended a performance with the North Korean leader, days after a report that the senior official was among a group  allegedly purged in the wake of a failed summit between Mr Kim and US president Donald Trump.
Kim Yong Chol, the aide who was the counterpart to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in the run-up to the Hanoi summit in February, was photographed attending a performance with the North Korean leader and other senior officials, according to state news agency Korean Central News Agency.
The report comes just days after Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s biggest daily newspaper, said Kim Yong Chol has been subjected to forced labour and ideological education in a remote province, while five other officials had been executed, including Kim Hyok Chol, special envoy to the US.
After the Chosun report on Friday – which had cited an unnamed North Korean source – many experts on North Korea had been wary of the veracity of the claims because similar reports in the past have later been disproved.
But analysts had not ruled out the possibility of punishments  for the officials involved in the Hanoi summit in February, which  ended early with no deal signed between the two leaders.
Christopher Green, a North Korea expert at the International Crisis Group, on Monday said “[as far as I know] Kim Yong Chol was sent for re-education months ago”, adding that the North Korean state media’s framing “also suggests re-education or similar”.
Soo Kim, a policy analyst at RAND Corporation and a former CIA analyst, said on Saturday that if true the latest purge “‘makes sense’ in North Korea’s logic of terror-induced loyalty”.
“This rotating chopping block is not an atypical method of course correction and imputing of blame on others by the Kim dynasty,” she said. “Kim has purged twice and later executed his uncle, Jang Song Taek. He also had purged [military official] Choe Ryong Hae in 2017, and others.”
US and South Korean officials on Friday said that they would investigate the claims of the purge.

India’s trade relationship with the US was plunged into uncertainty as New Delhi lamented an “unfortunate” decision by US president Donald Trump to strip the country of preferential access to the US market.
The Indian commerce ministry said at the weekend that it wanted to “find a mutually acceptable way forward” and had offered concessions to US demands after the Trump administration said India would lose its favoured trade status.
The US move on Friday threatens to become a new source of global economic tension just as Washington steps up its trade battle with Beijing and warns that it will hit Mexico with tariffs if it does not do more to stop illegal migration.
It reflects the Trump administration’s frustration over India’s increasingly protectionist policies on sectors ranging from e-commerce to medical devices to dairy products.
Mr Trump announced that from June 5 India would no longer qualify as a “beneficiary developing country” under Washington’s Generalised System of Preferences （GSP）, which gives low-income economies duty-free access to the US market for some exports.
New Delhi “has not assured the United States that India will provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets”, said Mr Trump in the statement.
The trade spat is a setback for Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, who won a second term by a landslide, but has to rejuvenate a slowing economy to deliver on his campaign promise to boost growth and create jobs.
India’s gross domestic product expansion fell below 6 per cent in the last quarter, weighed down by weak consumer demand and agrarian distress.
The commerce ministry in New Delhi said it had offered proposals on “significant US requests” and “it is unfortunate that this did not find acceptance by the US”, but it said India would continue to deepen its relationship with Washington.
India has long warned that it is ready to impose retaliatory tariffs on US goods.
Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $126bn in 2017, according to the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum.

LinkedIn is an exhausting place to visit, as a rule.
It attracts an inordinate number of people who are excited, pumped, psyched and stoked, usually because they have just moved jobs but sometimes because they have made it in to work in the morning.
So it was sobering to see a distinctly downbeat bit of news on the site the other day.
It came from Ed Whiting, strategy director at the Wellcome Trust, a large biomedical research foundation in London that jolted the world of work four months ago by saying it was thinking of testing a four-day week.
The four-day idea has been on a roll in Britain.
Trade union bosses have been calling for it.
The Labour party has commissioned the historian Robert Skidelsky to look into it.
A few employers have tried it, lured by research suggesting shorter weeks can make people less ill, less mistake-prone and more productive.
None were as big as Wellcome, which has about 800 staff.
So there was understandable excitement about the news that it might join the four-day push.
But Mr Whiting, a former adviser to ex-prime minister David Cameron, had bad news on LinkedIn.
After much consultation and debate, Wellcome had decided it could not even do a trial of the four-day week without “an unacceptable disruption” to its business, he said. As setbacks go, this was considerable. But it also offers some important lessons. Some of Wellcome’s reasons make sense. Others less so. Overall, it shows that people like me who are partial to the four-day idea need to put a lot more thought into it.
So what made Wellcome back out? First, there was a question of fairness. Mr Whiting said the Trust’s staff did a lot of different jobs. Some managed research grants; others ran an endowment fund; some kept a museum open to the public seven days a week. It was not going to be fair to let some people work four days if others had jobs that made this much harder to do. There was more, as I discovered after talking to Wellcome’s press office. Some staff were already working part-time so that they could care for relatives. What if Wellcome decided to close on one of their chosen working days? Others did not want to take any day off at all. They either preferred work to alternatives or thought it better “for their mental health” to spread their work across five days instead of four.
I understand these concerns but I am not convinced they are all deal-breakers.
If people need to take different days off, why insist everyone has to be away on the same day?
If they are really desperate to work all week, why stop them?
I can, however, readily accept another big explanation for Wellcome’s decision: bringing in a four-day week is a distraction, for managers and the managed alike.
This can’t be ignored in any organisation, let alone one doling out research money to help save lives around the world.
There is also the question of money. Mr Whiting says cost was not an issue at Wellcome. But it has been in other trials of shorter working weeks, like one in Sweden where care home nurses’ hours were cut from eight to six. The nurses were happier but the care home, unlike an office, needed workers around the clock so more people had to be hired and costs went up. Still, the four-day week seems to offer benefits that can offset or even outweigh those costs in some cases.
In Glasgow, a telephone and digital marketing company named Pursuit Marketing says it has saved hundreds of thousands of pounds in recruiting costs since word spread that it had made Fridays voluntary in 2016.
Productivity has jumped by 30 per cent and sickness days among the business’s 160-odd people are almost zero.
Other companies report similar improvements.
There is even evidence that shorter working weeks cut carbon emissions, say researchers at Autonomy, a think-tank and consultancy that helps businesses shift to a shorter working week.
None of this should be dismissed.
The four-day week has much going for it.
But its complexity cannot be ignored and it cannot be reserved for white-collar workers who can do it more easily.
In other words, cutting down on the working week will take a lot more work than has been done so far.

A planned merger of China’s largest steelmaker and a domestic rival is set to create a group whose combined production exceeded that of the entire US steel industry last year, as Beijing pushes forward with efforts to consolidate its vast steel sector.
According to a stock exchange filing on Sunday, China Baowu Steel Group will buy a majority stake in smaller producer Magang Steel to strengthen its “international competitiveness”.
The value of the deal was not disclosed.
The two companies had combined crude steel output last year of 87m tonnes, surpassing total US steel output of 86.6m tonnes, according to World Steel Association data.
That would put the combined group only slightly behind the world’s number one steelmaker, ArcelorMittal, which produced 92.5m tonnes of crude steel in 2018.
The merged group would have a combined capacity of 90m tonnes, and further expansion “could see the company become the world’s largest steel producer within the next two to three years”, according to analysts at S&P Global.
Beijing aims to consolidate its fragmented steel sector so that the top 10 producers account for 60 per cent of steel production, up from 35 per cent now.
Beijing has forced steelmakers to cut 200m tonnes of capacity since 2016.
Baowu is a product of a 2016 merger that made it China’s largest steelmaker.
“Baowu’s acquisition of Magang makes it the second-largest steelmaker globally, and extends its dominant position domestically,” said Tomas Gutierrez, Asia Editor at Kallanish Commodities.
Baowu Steel has announced a production target of 100m tonnes by 2021, and China’s strict limits on the construction of new capacity mean it is likely to meet the target through further acquisitions.
China is the world’s top consumer of steel.
It used 828m tonnes last year as its own production grew 6.6 per cent year on year to a record 928m tonnes, driven by strong demand from the property sector.
But falling car sales in China have begun to erode steel demand, and the possibility of output exceeding domestic demand this year raises the prospect of domestic steelmakers using exports as a pressure valve — something that would depress prices globally.
Baoshan Iron and Steel Co, the main listed arm of Baowu, has been hit by slowing Chinese demand for steel this year, with net profit falling 46 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year to Rmb2.7bn （$391m）.
State-funded infrastructure spending has helped prevent a sharper slowdown in demand.
“As Chinese steel demand is reaching a structural peak, only state spending can prevent a slump which would hurt steelmakers globally,” said Mr Gutierrez.

Beijing authorities will investigate FedEx for allegedly “undermining the legitimate rights and interests” of Chinese clients, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday, less than 24 hours after China’s commerce ministry said it would compile a list of “unreliable” foreign companies.
Xinhua said FedEx had not delivered packages to their intended recipients in China in violation of “laws and regulations governing the express industry in China”.
The agency did not identify the FedEx clients involved or say what penalties the US delivery company could face.
Last week, however, Huawei said FedEx had diverted packages sent from Japan to the US rather than to its offices in China.
FedEx is reported to have apologised for what it said was an error.
The US delivery company also said that it would fully co-operate with any regulatory investigation.
“Our relationship with Huawei Technologies and our relationships with all of our customers in China are important to us,” FedEx said.
US-China trade tension was ramped up again on Saturday morning when Washington began collecting 25 per cent tariffs on many Chinese goods arriving at its ports.
Earlier in the day Beijing began implementing its own higher retaliatory tariffs on much of its $60bn target list of American goods
Huawei is at the centre of this escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
In May, the US placed Huawei on a blacklist restricting its access to US components — a directive that could potentially cripple the company.
The US decision to blacklist Huawei, which came shortly after the US hiked punitive tariffs on about half of all Chinese exports to the US, has made it even more unlikely that the two countries can pave the way for a truce when Mr Trump and Xi Jinping attend a G20 leaders summit later this month in Japan.
China responded to Mr Trump’s tariffs with counter-tariffs of its own that took effect on June 1.
The commerce ministry’s announcement on Friday that it would compile a list of unreliable foreign companies that harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies was widely interpreted as retaliation to the Trump administration’s decision to restrict Huawei’s access to US components.
The commerce ministry has not yet formally added any companies to the list, which could target US companies that withhold components from Huawei.
Beijing officials have signalled that they could also retaliate against the US by withholding supplies of rare earths, most of which are mined in China and vital to many high-tech products.
US companies operating in China are bracing themselves for potential retaliatory measures in the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to increase tariffs and restrict Huawei’s access to American components.
Because the US exports far less to China than China exports to the US, Beijing cannot match Mr Trump’s tariffs dollar for dollar.
But Chinese officials have said they will not target US companies in revenge, many of whom are large employers and taxpayers.
Micron, a Idaho-based chipmaker that has alleged its proprietary technologies were stolen by a Chinese rival, is the subject of an antitrust investigation by Beijing regulators.

It seems to be the fate of any successful management idea that it should be both used and abused. It happened to Clay Christensen’s hypothesis on “disruptive innovation”. It happened to Toyota’s “lean” production system. It has also happened, according to Jim Collins, to his metaphor for an endless cycle of improvement, the flywheel.
The management writer and consultant launched the flywheel concept in his 2001 bestseller Good to Great, based on his team’s empirical research into successful companies.
But in an interview, he tells me that while he noticed an “increasing use of the term flywheel in places like Silicon Valley and elsewhere . . . as I looked at what people were doing, I felt that they didn’t really understand [it]”.
It is one reason he has just published Turning the Flywheel, a monograph, barely 40 pages long, exploring further how companies have implemented the concept.
Take Amazon, the first example in the new publication.
The company’s lower prices increase customer visits, which attract third-party sellers, which expand the range and distribution of the store, which increases revenue, which in turn allows Amazon to lower prices on more products and so restart the virtuous circle.
By sticking to its flywheel even through the dotcom bust, Amazon created, Mr Collins writes, “a customer-value compounding machine that many of the largest companies in the world came to fear”.
How could such an apparently simple concept be misconstrued? “People would take a list of strategic objectives and draw them as a circle,” says Mr Collins, referring to the proliferation of circular strategy diagrams, sometimes called “crap circles”. “The whole point of a flywheel is it’s exactly not that: it has an underlying causal logic to it.”
The other, graver, error, according to Mr Collins, is that successful businesses sometimes assume the flywheel only applies to one line of activity.
“If we define ourselves by the business we’re in rather than by the flywheel we’re building then at some point we do hit a wall,” he says.
Circuit City, the consumer electronics retailer, was one of the original exemplars of good-to-greatness in his 2001 book.
The company later faltered, he suggests, because in searching for the “next big thing”, it neglected the original stores — allowing rival Best Buy to overtake.
At the same time, while it had come up with a brilliant innovation — CarMax, a chain of used-car superstores — it failed to see that it could “generate years of additional momentum” by extending its flywheel strategy to the new business.
Instead, Circuit City demerged CarMax in 2002.
The electronics retail chain entered a “doom loop” （another Collins coinage）, filing for bankruptcy in 2008.
The monograph lists a number of companies that avoided decline by extending their flywheel strategy.
Apple moved from personal computers to smart handhelds; Walt Disney developed theme parks from its animated films; Boeing transferred its flywheel approach from military aircraft to commercial jets.
Amazon, in its turn, applied the momentum from its “everything store” to Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business.
“Everyone’s always looking for the next big thing,” says Mr Collins. “But if you grasp that if you get it right, the very big thing is the flywheel architecture . . . It can take you a really long way.”
I ask him whether he thinks the flywheel of 3G Capital, whose co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann is “an enduring great friend”, has started to stall. The Brazilian investment firm backed Kraft Heinz, the food company, and AB InBev, the brewer. Both companies have grown by aggressive acquisition and cost-cutting but now face challenges.
Mr Collins is cautious.
He says his connection is to Mr Lemann, not to the individual companies.
But he is confident that 3G’s flywheel of employing “great people and giving them big things to do” is still “incredibly powerful”, even though he concedes that all flywheels need “renewal and extension”.
The author seems to be maintaining his own momentum. At 61, while he has started to look to his legacy, he remains an irrepressible seller of the many concepts he and his co-authors have launched over the years, packaged in what his wife called the “wrapping paper” of attention-grabbing, often metaphorical, descriptions that enthuse his fans and appal his critics. The monograph contains an eight-page appendix in which he reprises his greatest hits — he calls it a framework for “what makes great companies tick” — from “first who, then what” （or the need to get “the right people on the bus”） to the “10X multiplier”, the idea that successful companies and people have a higher “return on luck”, making more of their good fortune.
I put it to him that selling a very short update on his previous work for $14.99 （£9.99 in the UK） is punchy, to say the least. “You could look at it as $14.99 for two years of my brain,” he retorts with a laugh. Sceptics will hoot at that, but Mr Collins is confident about the market for his ideas. Chief executives and strategists continue to beat a path to his Colorado management lab for his help and advice. And the last time he published a monograph spin-off from Good to Great — applying the bestseller’s ideas to the public and non-profit sector — he says he sold close to 1m copies.

The biggest US technology companies are re-examining their supply chains to identify Chinese groups that may be targeted in the escalating trade war between China and the US.
Executives at several multinational tech companies told the Financial Times they were poring through their list of suppliers to work out what they might do if a key business was hit by sanctions either from the US or China.
Cisco, the network equipment maker, has already said it had “greatly reduced” its manufacturing in China, while others said they were worried about continuing to buy from Chinese camera makers, drone makers and consumer electronics companies.
Most companies did not want to be named, but lawyers and industry groups said they had received requests from the industry to help them identify companies that might fall under the spotlight in Washington.
John Miller, vice-president for policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents multinational tech companies, said: “A lot of technology and telecoms companies right now are paying close attention to their supply chains. Many are seeking the help of government to identify possible risk factors too.”
A senior executive at a global tech group said: “We are going through our supply chain looking for where might it get hit, of course. You would have to be mad not to do so in the current political climate.”
Many technology executives were taken aback when the Trump administration announced a series of measures targeting Huawei last month.
Though it had been widely expected that the president would ban the Chinese telecoms equipment maker from 5G networks, the scope of his executive order came as a surprise, as did the decision by the commerce department to stop US companies exporting to Huawei.
In the wake of that move, many technology companies have been re-examining which other suppliers might be hit.
Mr Trump has given Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, the power to ban any technology company he thinks might pose a national security risk.
Mr Ross is due to make a decision about exactly which ones to target in just over three months.
George Mathew, the chief executive of Kespry, a US group that makes software for drones, said he might have to change his company’s entire manufacturing policy should the Trump administration take action against DJI, the Chinese drone maker.
Last month the US Department of Homeland Security warned that DJI drones were capable of collecting and transferring users’ data to other parties or countries.
Mr Mathew, whose company has a partnership with DJI, said he had not experienced any problems or data leaks from the Chinese company. But he added: “If things escalate in a way where DJI is now considered a source of data that is compromised or there are certain concerns around it, that changes the entire dynamic. We have a historic manufacturing base that we were shifting to DJI, but there is a possibility we might have to extend it instead.”
Other Chinese companies also appear to be at risk.
Hikvision, the surveillance equipment maker, is preparing for the possibility that it will be put on the US export blacklist in the coming weeks.
One US industry consultant said he had been approached by a multinational company asking for an assessment of whether Xiaomi, the consumer electronics company, could also be targeted.
More worrying for many US technology companies are the signs of retaliation from Beijing.
On Friday, China announced it would launch its own blacklist of “unreliable” foreign entities which could be restricted from selling in China.
Many are worried that Beijing might also restrict exports of rare earths, which are commonly used in technology such as electric cars or drones, and which are overwhelmingly produced in China.
Jim Litinsky, co-chairman of MP Materials, the only US rare earths mine, said his company had been contacted by more than one multinational company asking how quickly it could ramp up production should imports from China be squeezed.
He added: “We are increasing production as quickly as possible. But if China were to do that, it would be a dramatic escalation of the conflict — the beginning of cold war 2.0.”
Jim Lewis, director of the Washington-based technology programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: “It is not the high-end technology which is most at risk, but some of the lower-end products in which China specialises.
“Things like capacitors, which are cheap and easy to make, and for which US companies are now starting to look towards Japan, South Korea, Taiwan or Vietnam.”

The state is the most important of all our institutional innovations.
It is the ultimate guarantor of security.
But its power also makes it frightening.
For this reason, people sometimes pretend it is weaker than it is.
In one area of economics, this is particularly true: money.
Money is a creature of the state.
Modern monetary theory, a controversial account of this truth, is analytically correct, so far as it goes.
But where it does not go is crucial: money is a powerful tool, but it can be abused.
L Randall Wray of the University of Missouri-Kansas City set out these ideas in Modern Monetary Theory.
They have the following fundamental elements.
First, taxes drive money.
This doctrine is called “chartalism”.
Governments can force their citizens to use the money it issues, because that is how people pay their taxes.
The state’s money will thus become the money used for domestic transactions.
Banks depend upon the government’s bank — the central bank — as lender of last resort.
The IOUs of banks — the predominant form of money in today’s economies — are imperfect substitutes for such sovereign money.
They are imperfect, because banks may become illiquid or insolvent and so may default.
That is why banking crises are common.
Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, no mechanical relationship exists between holdings of central bank liabilities by banks （that is, reserves） and creation of bank money.
Since the financial crisis, central bank balance sheets and bank reserves have grown hugely, but broader monetary aggregates have not.
The explanation is that the dominant driver of the money supply is the （risk-adjusted） profitability of lending, which is high in booms and low in busts.
The weakness of credit also explains why inflation has remained low.
Third, governments need never default on loans in their own currency.
The government does not need to raise taxes or borrow to pay its way; it is possible for it to create the money it needs.
This makes it simple for governments to run deficits, in order to ensure full employment.
Fourth, only inflation sets limits on a government’s ability to spend.
But, if inflation emerges, the government has to tighten demand, by raising taxes.
Finally, governments do not need to issue bonds in order to fund themselves.
The reason for borrowing is to manage demand, by altering interest rates, or the supply of reserves to banks.
This analysis is correct, up to a point.
It also has implications for policy.
A sovereign government can always spend in order to support demand.
Again, expansion of the central bank balance sheet does not make high inflation likely, let alone inevitable.
Some believers in MMT argue that the power to create money should be used to offer a universal jobs guarantee or finance programmes such as the Green New Deal proposed by Democrats in the US.
But such ideas do not follow from their analysis.
These are just suggestions for where the state should spend.
What then are the problems with MMT?
These are twofold: economic and political.
An important economic difficulty, clear from painful western experience in the 1970s, is that it is hard to know where “full employment” lies.
Excess demand may exist in some sectors or regions, and deficient demand elsewhere.
Full employment is a highly uncertain range, not a single point.
A still more important economic mistake is to ignore the expectations that drive people’s behaviour.
Suppose holders of money fear that the government is prepared to spend on its high priority items, regardless of how overheated the economy might become.
Suppose holders of money fear that the central bank has also become entirely subject to the government’s whims （which has happened often enough in the past）.
They are then likely to dump money in favour of some other asset, causing a collapsing currency, soaring asset prices and booming demand for durables.
This may not lead to outright hyperinflation.
But it might lead to a burst of high inflation, which becomes entrenched.
The focus of MMT’s proponents on balance sheets and indifference to expectations that drive behaviour are huge errors.
These mistakes are economic ones, but there is a related and far worse political error, as Sebastian Edwards of University of California, Los Angeles, has argued.
If politicians think they do not need to worry about the possibility of default, only about inflation, their tendency may be to assume output can be driven far higher, and unemployment far lower, than is possible without triggering an upsurge in inflation.
That happened to many western countries in the 1970s.
It has happened more often to developing countries, especially in Latin America.
But the economic and social consequences of big spikes in inflation can be very damaging.
Yet the same is also true for high unemployment.
So, in managing a modern monetary economy, one has to avoid two gross errors.
One is to rely on private sector demand too much, since that can all too easily end up with highly destructive financial booms and busts.
The opposite error is to rely on government-led demand too much, since that may well generate destructive inflation booms and busts.
The solution, nearly all of the time, is to delegate the needed discretion to independent central banks and financial regulators.
Yet proponents of MMT are right that during a period of structurally feeble private demand （as in Japan since 1990） or a deep slump, a sovereign government must and can act, on its own or in co-operation with the central bank, to offset private weakness.
There is then no reason to fear the constraints.
It should just go for it.

A global trade war looms. A Swiss bank shows its diplomatic finesse. Credit Suisse on Monday appointed Zhenyi Tang, former chairman of Asia-focused CLSA broker, as its China chief executive. It is no coincidence Mr Tang served 17 years in China’s finance ministry. Svelte Swiss wealth managers in well-tailored suits are not about to storm China. But a local boss with book full of Beijing contacts should give Credit Suisse an edge, especially over US rivals.
A tilt towards fast-growing Asian markets underpins Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam’s restructuring strategy.
The Asia Pacific unit’s reported pre-tax income fell 9 per cent to SFr664m in 2018, however, hit late in the year by Asian financial market turmoil.
Attracting China’s offshore riches is one thing.
But the onshore market is four-fifths of the wealth of Chinese worth $1m or more, says Deutsche Bank.
Capital controls and restrictions on ownership have entrenched domestic service providers, however.
Foreign rivals such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Nomura have footholds.
Trumpian geopolitics have made life difficult for US banks such as JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs.
Furthest ahead in putting bankers’ boots on the ground is Swiss rival UBS, which in December increased its stake in a local securities joint venture to 51 per cent.
UBS’s local Shanghai boss, Eugene Qian, is a longtime banker who started his career in London.
In appointing Mr Tang, Credit Suisse is deploying a classic banking tactic — using a government veteran to open doors.
In this respect, China is nothing special.
In France, HSBC bank’s local chief executive, Jean Beunardeau, is a former French finance ministry official.
But the politics are still more sensitive in China.
Building a wealth management franchise pitched at billionaire entrepreneurs will require a network of national and regional licences — as well as investment sophistication or local expertise in areas such as inheritance planning.
A Beijing operative should help.
So, too, will the neutral Swiss flag.

Renewed global trade tensions have led the airline industry’s top trade body to sharply downgrade its profit forecast for the year, underscoring the mushrooming impact of President Donald Trump’s trade war with China.
The International Air Transport Association, which represents about 290 airlines that account for more than 80 per cent of all air traffic, on Sunday cut its forecast for the industry’s overall profits this year to $28bn. That is down from the previous forecast in December of $35.5bn, and would represent a 7 per cent decline from 2018.
“Weakening of global trade is likely to continue as the US-China trade war intensifies,” said Alexandre de Juniac, Iata’s director-general and chief executive officer.
“This primarily impacts the cargo business, but passenger traffic could also be impacted as tensions rise. Airlines will still turn a profit this year, but there is no easy money to be made.”
Financial markets and business executives were already reeling from the tensions with China that flared up again at the beginning of May, and Mr Trump’s threat last week to impose tariffs on Mexico has exacerbated concerns that global trade is once again coming under pressure.
Car manufacturers and other companies with complex international supply chains have come under particular strain, but the airline industry would also feel the heat, according to Mr de Juniac.
“Aviation needs borders that are open to people and to trade. Nobody wins from trade wars, protectionist policies or isolationist agendas. But everybody benefits from growing connectivity. A more inclusive globalisation must be the way forward,” he said in the statement.
The airline industry is also coming under pressure from “rising costs right across the board”, such as mounting fuel costs, wage pressures and more expensive infrastructure.
As a result, overall costs are expected to expand by 7.4 per cent this year, crimping net margins to 3.2 per cent and lowering the profit-per-passenger from $6.85 in 2018 to $6.12, Iata estimates.
After a turbulent 2018 the Bloomberg World Airlines Index bounced back with a 15 per cent gain between January and mid-April, but the escalating trade war and concerns over the health of the global economy has sent the gauge down by more than 12 per cent in May.
Chinese airlines are among the biggest decliners, but the shares of Air Canada, Interglobe Aviation and Spring Airlines were the only members of the index to climb last month.
“The good news is that airlines have broken the boom-and-bust cycle. A downturn in the trading environment no longer plunges the industry into a deep crisis. But under current circumstances, the great achievement of the industry — creating value for investors with normal levels of profitability is at risk,” Mr de Juniac said. “Airlines will still create value for investors in 2019 with above cost-of-capital returns, but only just.”
For Boeing, the world’s largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, trade tensions add to concerns over the worldwide grounding of its best-selling 737 Max jet, after two crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed 346 people.
“The long-term prospects of our business count on people’s confidence in the safety of flying,” Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday, acknowledging the reputational damage inflicted by the discovery of safety flaws in the plane’s flight control system. “The trust of the flying public has been hurt and it will take time for us to rebuild that trust.”

The growing dispute between the US and China on trade and technology is increasing the risk of military conflict or outright war in Asia, a region that hosts some of the world’s most dangerous geopolitical flashpoints, south-east Asian defence ministers cautioned at a security forum on Sunday.
The warnings at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, the annual Asian defence summit, came as China at the weekend stepped up its counter-offensive against the US in their trade war, announcing an investigation of delivery group FedEx and a potential blacklist of foreign companies or individuals considered “unreliable”.
“With the untethering of our networks of economic interdependence comes growing risk of confrontation that could lead to war,” Delfin Lorenzana, defence minister of the Philippines, said on Sunday at the Shangri-La Dialogue, the annual security conference in Singapore. “Our greatest fear, therefore, is the possibility of sleepwalking into another international conflict like world war one.”
Ng Eng Hen, Singapore’s defence minister, echoed concerns that the heightened divisions could erupt into war.
“I don’t think that scenario is so minuscule that it won't happen,” he said.
“When [the] US imposed restrictions on the sale of parts by US companies to Huawei, they subsequently found out that there were many, many companies in the US that were affected,” he told the FT. “To us, that interdependency is not only good economically but good for security. Because if we’re so economically interdependent, then the price of conflict is very high.”
China hawks in the administration of US president Donald Trump are increasingly pushing for a full “decoupling” of the country’s technology supply chain from China, last month placing telecoms equipment maker Huawei on a blacklist restricting it from doing business with US companies.
Asia is riddled with unresolved geopolitical disputes ranging from Beijing’s claims on Taiwan and the stand-off between North Korea and South Korea, which remain technically at war, to the South China Sea, where China has built up a number of reefs and shoals in international waters into artificial islands and has installed missiles.
Beijing has also used its coast guard and maritime militia, backed up by navy vessels, to deny Philippine fishing boats access to contested land features in the region traditionally controlled by Manila.
In Singapore, Patrick Shanahan, acting US secretary of defence, described China — without naming it — as “the greatest long-term threat to the vital interests of states across this region”, arguing that Beijing was destabilising Asia with a “toolkit of coercion”.
But he also sounded a conciliatory note, saying: “China could still have a co-operative relationship with the United States.”
The attendance of General Wei Fenghe, the first Chinese defence minister to attend the conference since 2011, had raised expectations that Beijing might try to counter anxiety among its neighbours over its rapidly growing naval and air might and its sometimes aggressive use of those capabilities.
But while Gen Wei appealed at the forum for peace, openness and “win-win co-operation” and claimed that China was not threatening anyone, his speech was generally hawkish.
“As for the recent trade friction started by the US, if the US wants to talk, we will keep the door open. If they want a fight, we will fight, we will fight till the end,” Gen Wei said.
Gen Wei reiterated China’s longstanding threat of invading Taiwan and refused to acknowledge neighbours’ concerns over the military build-up in the South China Sea.
Several Asian countries, including some US allies such as the Philippines or nations that have more limited security co-operation with the US such as Singapore, have long fretted that the increasingly open rivalry between Washington and Beijing might force them to choose sides.
Those fears took on much greater urgency this year.
Mohamad Sabu, Malaysia’s defence minister, said there would be “regional anxiety if smaller nations would be forced to take sides — one that has detrimental implications on economic development and nation-building”.

Huawei has ordered employees to cancel technical meetings with US contacts and repatriated Americans working at its Shenzhen headquarters, as tensions rise between the Chinese telecoms group and the US government.
Dang Wenshuan, Huawei’s chief strategy architect, said American citizens working in research and development at Huawei’s headquarters were sent back to the US two weeks ago, after the Trump administration blacklisted the Chinese group and 68 affiliates.
A workshop that was under way at the time of the announcement was hastily disbanded, and American delegates were asked to remove their laptops, isolate their networks and leave the Huawei premises.
“We don’t know what will happen . . . We don’t know the boundary of the law, we have to be whiter than white,” Mr Dang told the Financial Times in a recent interview.
Huawei also spent several days making significant changes to the way its offices in China and the US communicate with one another, in order to ensure all its interactions were compliant with the “entity list,” which requires US suppliers to seek government approval to sell parts and components to the group.
Huawei is also limiting interactions more broadly between employees and any American citizens, Mr Dang added.
Huawei said it has been checking overseas visitors to its campus do not hold American passports, and warned ones that do that their private conversations must not touch on any topics related to technology.
One US citizen based in China was surprised to receive a polite message from a longstanding business contact at Huawei that postponed all contact until further notice.
The message, seen by the Financial Times, said: “Because of our side’s regulation, we are not allowed to meet US citizens to discuss affairs related to technology.”
But lawyers question the extent to which the steps have been brought on by US action.
“It doesn’t appear these measures address the issues the US government has raised with them,” said Eric Crusius, a partner at the law firm Holland & Knight, in reference to US charges against the Chinese telecoms group of corporate theft and violating sanctions against Iran, as well as concerns that Huawei may be used by the Chinese government to conduct espionage through its 5G network overseas.
“In some respects, separating the US and Chinese operations could be seen as a good thing, since it isolates the US business. But in another way, it could look as if Huawei is shutting itself off from the rest of the world, which would not be a good thing.”
Huawei executives argue that Washington is creating a schism in the tech world, fuelled in part by concerns over espionage and IP theft, as well as a more fundamental fear of China’s rising tech prowess.
They say that as the biggest global supplier of telecoms kit, Huawei has become a lightening rod for those fears.

Executive education is now seen as the biggest opportunity for many business schools.
Yet technological change and the rising number of providers offering alternatives to traditional institutions have made it one of the most challenging and competitive sectors for providers in which to achieve growth.
The expansion in the market for short programmes teaching practical skills in bite-sized courses is driven by the need for employees to retrain to be productive in a digital age.
The international university consortium for executive education （Unicon）, which represents more than 100 business schools offering this kind of teaching, suggests the total market is worth about $2bn and has grown by 20 per cent over the past five years.
A survey by the Chartered Association of Business Schools of UK-based deans and senior managers in late 2018 found that executive education programmes were seen as second only to new online degree courses as a source of revenue growth over the next decade.
Demand for executive education is also being helped by the switch in postgraduate education away from two-year MBA courses, covering a broad range of business subjects, to one-year business masters degrees that specialise in management or finance.
“Speciality masters degree graduates need to top up their skills in management and leadership as they move up in their organisations,” says Tom Robinson, president of accreditation body the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Many are likely to turn to executive education rather than another full-time masters, he adds. This gives these students the ability to reskill in specific emerging concepts, such as fintech and data analytics.
The problem for the business school executive education teams is remaining fresh in an age when courses can be taught through apps on a smartphone or immersive role-playing exercises, rather than through classroom-based seminars.
“The potential market for business schools is vast, but the market for learning and development is evolving rapidly,” says Andrew Crisp, founder of education research company CarringtonCrisp. “No longer is it dominated by classroom learning or executive retreats, but instead digital is to the fore with everything from microcredentials to digital badges to stackable certificates.”
Burgundy School of Business in France currently runs only business degree programmes.
But its vision for the future is a network of executive education courses focused exclusively on the wine industry, delivered from hubs in the main wine distribution locations around the world, satisfying demand for the specialist skills needed to succeed in a market growing by about 6 per cent a year, according to Stéphan Bourcieu, BSB’s dean.
“We are a niche market, but it is global and expanding fast,” he says.
How business schools respond will have a big impact on their future growth. The Wharton School in Pennsylvania is one of a handful of top schools worldwide, alongside Harvard Business School, Insead in France and Switzerland’s IMD, that generate more than $100m of revenue a year from executive education.
Mike Malefakis is associate vice-dean at Wharton Executive Education, and has been involved in the executive education market since 1992.
He says the sector has changed “radically” in the past five years, in particular due to the introduction of online teaching models.
However, he believes that business schools with strong brands such as Wharton have an opportunity to rise above the new competition in the same way that trusted media organisations have succeeded in an age of fake news.
“The ‘netflixisation’ of executive education is going to happen,” he says, referring to the way the streaming-media company has challenged the dominance of traditional broadcasters.
“But there is a difference between the deep learning we can provide and superficial learning.”
Another way for business schools to fend off the competition from other executive education providers is to form partnerships with bodies that need to train senior officials.
One example is the partnership established by Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business in Washington DC and the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to run the Certified Regulatory and Compliance Professional programme.
This is the first year Georgetown’s McDonough School has been involved, but the programme has been around for nearly 20 years and has an active network of 1,200 alumni.
As it is the only such programme for compliance professionals, it attracts people from a range of roles, such as investment advisers, compliance professionals and industry regulators.
Although it is focused on US market regulations at the state and federal level, it is also relevant for overseas regulators dealing with that jurisdiction, which in turn adds to the quality of the discussion and depth of knowledge shared in each session, according to the course organisers.
The leading schools in the FT’s executive education rankings are hiring separate teams of teaching staff, called professors of practice. Rather than academic credentials, these individuals have practical experience of management. This makes them more valuable to executive education course participants, who want knowledge they can use the next day in the office, says David Asch, quality services director at the European Foundation for Management Development, the business school accreditation body. “The academic doesn’t cut it for these courses,” he says. “The key is to make sure you continue to be relevant to the organisations you serve.”
There is now a constant need for life-long learning at all levels in organisations, which increases the market for everyone, says Mireia Rius, associate dean for executive education at Spain’s Iese Business School. “Companies are changing thanks to technological disruption and longer working lives, which means that for the first time we can have four or five generations [Generation X, Generation Y etc] in the same organisation,” she says. “This all requires a new type of leadership and means today’s executives and firms need to develop different capabilities and skills.”
The challenge for executive education providers is to ensure they are still meeting the needs of clients whose skills needs as well as demand for retraining are changing.
“We are constantly researching, experimenting, testing, and working in partnership with our clients to see what works best,” says Rius, questioning the model of topping up knowledge from a business degree later with short courses.
“The old idea of episodic learning — ‘I’ll do an MBA, then at a later date I’ll do an executive programme’ — is not realistic, nor optimal for many,” she says. “Instead, there is more need for constant, life-long learning for individuals and at all levels in an organisation.”

With rugby teams practising on its playing fields against the backdrop of a red-brick bell tower, Dulwich College is the picture of a quintessentially English private school.
But this is Shanghai, and the near-clone of the college’s 400-year old parent in London is one of a growing number of prestigious British educational institutions lending their names to newly minted offshoots abroad.
Officials at the UK’s Department for International Trade say they are aware of more than 120 foreign projects being considered by British schools.
The new branches dovetail with the government’s global education strategy, which aims to support “ transnational education” of fee-paying pupils abroad as a source of exports.
Many such pupils go on to apply for UK university places.
David Cook, who ran Dulwich’s first international school in Thailand before becoming headmaster of Repton in Dubai, and then oversaw the creation of schools for both Harrow and Wellington in China, said: “It’s quite extraordinary. I could never have imagined 20 years ago that this growth would happen.”
But sector specialists caution that the surge in schools exploring foreign offshoots may not be sustainable, undermining the government’s aim to boost annual education exports from £20bn to £35bn by 2030.
They point out that the expansion comes against a backdrop of political and economic uncertainty in Asia and the Gulf, where demand for the schools is highest, and the schools themselves have limited capacity to expand abroad while maintaining their operations back in the UK.
In the premium private international school market, “the cake is becoming bigger but it is being sliced between many more who are taking a share,” cautioned Ashwin Assomull, a partner in the education practice at LEK, a consultancy. He added that there had been an explosion in both British schools abroad and a number of rival private international school chains.
British and other international schools in the past catered primarily to expatriates, but during the past decade demand in emerging markets — led by China — has grown sharply to cater for an expanding domestic middle class with disposable income and global aspirations for their children.
Colin Bell, the chief executive of the Council of British International Schools, said this growing demand reflected “the reputation of British education, and English as the business language of choice”.
He added that UK and US universities were also highly ranked, and British schools were seen as an important route into them.
According to ISC Research, which tracks education trends, there are now 73 British independent schools with sister schools or partnerships abroad.
They teach a total of 45,000 students and have annual fee income of $1bn.
Another 19 are due to open during the next two years.
Joe Spence, the master of Dulwich College in London, which now has 10 international partnerships, argued that the appetite for elite public schools reflected “the development of the British model over 150 years, balancing academic quality with pastoral care. and supra- and co-curricular activities such as music, drama, charitable work and leadership”.
He said the revenues generated by Dulwich’s overseas branches were used to fund scholarships that encourage social mobility back in London, while international exchanges enriched the experience for students and staff alike.
But he stressed that his overseas strategywas not a “not smash and grab”.
It brought revenues of only about £1m a year and required a significant investment in resources for the supervision, support and selection of senior staff.
Mark Abell, a lawyer at Bird & Bird, confirmed that the scope for elite schools such as Dulwich to expand profitably was limited. Mr Abell, who has acted for 80 schools and has 30 projects under discussion, said economies of scale were important. “I explain to clients that if they want to open one or two schools, they are wasting their time: they will never go to scale and will not have a long-term sustainable project,” he said.
He pointed out that schools could struggle to maintain standards at faraway branches, where it can be difficult balance the school’s interests with those of local business partners who typically manage and own the properties.
For example, Dulwich split from its first school in Thailand over differences in approach.
“You have kids with different levels of motivation and English language proficiency, and local partners who want to fill their facilities quickly so you can’t be so selective,” added Mr Assomull at LEK.
Profitability is also undermined by the limited capacity in some emerging markets outside China, such as India and Vietnam, to pay high school fees.
Even in the Gulf states, the fall in oil prices has had a knock-on effect on demand for private schools, with revenues declining and expatriates leaving.
There have also been moves in China to limit the opening of international schools in Shanghai and Beijing, with growth strongest in bilingual schools for Chinese nationals, where there are firm controls including restrictions over the curriculum.
As a result, new, cheaper Chinese-operated private schools are emerging.
Back in the UK, demand for university places from students graduating from overseas offshoots is being limited by the institutions’ capacity to take foreign students, and tight restrictions on immigration.
The expansion of schools abroad offers “a great opportunity for British soft power, but it’s a pity they have stopped granting visas so easily,” said Mr Abell.
Sam Macdonald, a partner at Farrer & Co, who advises schools, said: “I’ve always assumed there was a limited window for growth. There is only so much capacity in the UK. But the trend doesn’t seem to be slowing down yet.”

China has accused the US of “resorting to intimidation and coercion” as Beijing stepped up its trade war counter-offensive with tariff increases on $60bn of American goods and a probe into US delivery group FedEx.
Wang Shouwen, the deputy head of Beijing’s negotiating team, on Sunday hit out at Washington for effectively barring US companies from using equipment made by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, saying it had complicated efforts to find a resolution to the trade impasse.
“The China-US economic and trade consultations have been severely frustrated by the US tariff increases and [Washington’s] abuse of export controls by including Chinese companies on the entities list,” Mr Wang said at the release of a Chinese government report on the state of US trade talks.
“The more the US government is offered, the more it wants,” China’s State Council added in the trade talks white paper.
“Resorting to intimidation and coercion, it persisted with exorbitant demands . . . and insisted on including mandatory requirements [that infringe on] China’s sovereign affairs in the deal.”
Wei Fenghe, Chinese defence minister, also upped the rhetoric on Sunday, telling the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore: “If the US wants [more trade talks], we will keep the door open — if they want a fight, we will fight to the end.”
US president Donald Trump last month announced increased tariffs on about half of all Chinese exports to the US, worth about $250bn, and ordered the Department of Commerce to put Shenzhen-based Huawei on an “ entities list” restricting its access to essential US components and technologies.
China responded by increasing tariffs on about $60bn dollars worth of US imports, which came into effect over the weekend, and announced it would establish its own blacklist of foreign companies that harm the interests of Chinese groups.
A day later, state media reported that Beijing was investigating FedEx for allegedly “undermining the legitimate rights and interests” of its Chinese clients.
Last week Huawei accused the Memphis-based delivery company of diverting packages destined for its offices in China to the US.
FedEx said it would co-operate fully with the investigation, and has reportedly apologised for what it said was an error.
“Our relationship with Huawei Technologies and our relationships with all of our customers in China are important to us,” the company said in a statement.
Mr Wang sought to reassure foreign investors’ concerns about China’s list of “unreliable foreign companies and individuals”, saying the development had been “over-interpreted”.
“The legitimate rights and interests of foreign companies will be respected,” he said.
“They should be at ease about this.”
But citing the investigation into  FedEx, Mr Wang noted that foreign companies “should be investigated” if they violated Chinese law or abetted “non-commercial” actions against Chinese companies including “blockades”.
Mr Wang added that more details about the commerce ministry’s list of unreliable companies and individuals would be released “soon”.
The vice-minister declined to comment on whether Mr Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping would meet on the sidelines of this month’s G20 leaders’ summit in Japan — an event that most analysts believe will offer the two sides an opportunity to halt further escalations and resume talks that have been frozen since early May.
The US president, however, has threatened to begin implementing another round of tariffs — affecting all imports from China — later this month.

The US Federal Aviation Administration on Sunday highlighted new problems with some of Boeing’s 737 Max jets and an older model, saying that certain parts on more than 300 aircraft may not have been properly manufactured.
The US aviation regulator issued a statement warning that wing components that provide greater lift during take-off and landing, known as leading edge slat tracks, on the affected aircraft “may not meet all applicable regulatory requirements for strength and durability”.
“The affected parts may be susceptible to premature failure or cracks resulting from the improper manufacturing process,” said the FAA.
. It added, however, that even a “complete failure” of the parts would not lead to the loss of an aircraft.
The disclosure related to 179 Max aircraft worldwide, as well as 133 older models called the 737 NG.
The Max jet has been grounded since March following two deadly crashes that have been linked to a separate concern about a piece of software in the plane.
Sunday’s statement comes as US prosecutors and lawmakers are scrutinising both the FAA and Boeing over the safety certification process that led to the 737 Max being approved for commercial use.
The FAA has faced criticism that it was not proactive enough in its oversight of Boeing, with critics pointing to its failure to ground the 737 Max in March until after aviation authorities outside the US had grounded the jet.
On Sunday, the aerospace manufacturer said it had contacted airlines to advise them to inspect the slats on certain jets.
“One batch of slat tracks with specific lot numbers produced by a supplier was found to have a potential nonconformance. If operators find the parts in question, they are to replace them with new ones before returning the airplane to service,” Boeing said in a statement.
The company said it had not been informed of any in-flight issues arising from the slat tracks concerned.
Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: “We are committed to supporting our customers in every way possible as they identify and replace these potentially nonconforming tracks.”
The FAA said it had been informed of the issue by Boeing.
It ordered operators with affected aircraft to replace the parts at issue within 10 days and said it had notified international aviation authorities.

The intensifying trade war between the US and China has struck fear into emerging market investors and triggered a wave of outflows from EM equities and bonds.
But analysts warn that it could be just a taster of what is to come.
Foreign money has left EM assets at a rate of more than $5bn a week since US president Donald Trump toughened his line against Chinese imports on May 6, according to the Institute of International Finance, which tracks cross-border capital flows.
However, even after these recent outflows, foreign investors have accumulated net positions in EM assets of more than $30bn for the year to date, according to the IIF.
Many investors appear to be staying put in the belief that the dispute will be over before long.
“The whole market can turn on a tweet,” said Bhanu Baweja, a strategist at UBS. “People are naively hoping that Trump will fold in front of China very soon. But it seems more serious.”
While hopes for a resolution persist, prices have also been driven by the unexpected strength of the US dollar, which many investors wrongly predicted would weaken this year, boosting EM currencies.
While EM corporate and sovereign bonds issued in foreign currencies are at year-to-date highs, local currency assets — equities and government bonds — have suffered, down 10 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, from their 2019 peaks.
Yet they remain net positive for the year — but only just.
Local bond prices have fallen slowly and erratically from their peak in late January.
“The market has given up 70 to 80 per cent of its gains but it has happened extremely quietly in a slow bleed,” Mr Baweja said. “As we approach zero, people will say, ‘I want to crystallise the little profit that remains, I’m selling’.”
Robin Brooks, chief economist at the IIF, agrees that markets are seeing an unwinding of positions taken since January, but not yet a rebalancing of substantial positions built up over the past several years. “The short-term question is whether to protect profits by reducing positions taken in the first quarter,” he said. “The longer-term question is what to do with those big, strategic bets.”
He adds that the trade war is a short-term manifestation of a longer-term global realignment, as developed economies start to bring back manufacturing and growth in developing economies begins to taper, as a result.
If so, and investors rethink their big strategic bets on EM, they may find themselves stuck, he says.
In Argentina, for example, the drastic reversal in the value of foreign portfolio investment after last year’s currency shock was caused overwhelmingly by a fall in prices, rather than outflows.
“If markets get a whiff of large-scale selling, investors will face big losses,” he said.

China and the US are “embracing while fighting”, to use a Chinese phrase. The concealed aggression may serve some purpose for the combatants, but for investors it makes it hard to know where the next punches may land.
So far, the main target has been Huawei, the unlisted Chinese telecoms equipment giant which has been  blacklisted by the Trump administration.
But there are five other Chinese tech companies — Hangzhou Hikvision, Zhejiang Dahua, iFlytek, Xiamen Meiya and Beijing Megvii — that are also spoken of in Washington as possible subjects of US export bans.
All aside from Megvii are listed on China’s A-share market.
Beyond them, the broader implications for investors both in China and in the US depend on whether the current trans-Pacific conflagration remains merely a trade war or turns into a fundamental reordering of the US-China relationship.
“Will this week be remembered as the one when the US-China relationship irrevocably changed?” asks Miranda Carr, a strategist at Haitong, a Chinese brokerage.
“At the moment, it certainly seems that way and so requires a fundamental rethink of assumptions on both future economic growth — and which industries and companies will benefit,” she adds.
Such a rethink implies two basic approaches for the China investor.
The first is a forensic dissection of which companies are most at risk from potential US broadsides.
The second is an appreciation of China’s key vulnerabilities if the current bout of fisticuffs spirals into an economic cold war.
In the case of the first, overseas investors in A-shares find themselves in unfamiliar territory.
With the first tranches of A-shares being added to the main MSCI Emerging Markets index only last year, the antennas of some investors have been insufficiently attuned to danger.
Hikvision — a key supplier of the face-recognition technology that has enabled China to throw a security chokehold over its Muslim minority region of Xinjiang — is a case in point. As late as last November — by which time reports of the company’s role in internment camps were already common — Hikvision remained a favourite for international fund investors in A-shares.
Indeed, some 19 per cent of around 180 of the world’s largest emerging market funds held Hikvision last November, according to Copley Fund Research, a consultancy, placing the company in the top three most favoured A-shares.
Since then, however, international institutions have pared back their holdings.
Nine funds — including Fidelity Emerging Markets, UBS Global Emerging Markets and American Funds’ New World Fund — have got out of the company completely, while several others have slashed their stakes.
Nevertheless, 16.9 per cent of the funds still held Hikvision at the end of April this year, even after the US administration’s displeasure with the company had been publicly communicated. These funds included Aberdeen Emerging Markets, Magellan and Comgest Growth EM among many others.
Thus if Hikvision is added to the US “ entity list”, which prohibits US companies from exporting key components and services to the Chinese firm, it will have been a well-telegraphed move.
More broadly, though, investors need to take a close look at which A-share companies are vulnerable to US export bans.
Sectors such as artificial intelligence, communications equipment and semiconductors are regarded as a few most at risk, partly because of the competitive threat they pose to US counterparts, analysts said.
Aside from tech issues, a broad range of Chinese macroeconomic vulnerabilities are also seen as susceptible to an intensification of US economic pressure on China.
The most basic is that it could threaten China’s charmed decade of “double surpluses”, meaning surpluses to the capital and current accounts.
This pushed money into the economy and kept most of it hemmed in behind China’s largely closed capital account.
If now — partly as a byproduct of US trade pressure — China were to experience a reduction in inflows from trade and from capital investments, support for the renminbi against the US dollar could wilt and place upward pressure on domestic interest rates, analysts said.
Indeed it may be, as JP Smith of Ecstrat, an advisory firm, says that key underpinnings of China’s economic model are starting to fray.
“The paradox of the Chinese variant of state capitalism is that it relies on the US-led international trade and investment community being prepared to tolerate a very unbalanced pattern of market access,” Mr Smith says.
Of course, a White House run by Mr Trump can turn on a dime.
Some analysts see the possibility of a trade agreement as early as next month when the G20 group of nations meets in Japan.
But even if that occurs, the broad support in Washington for getting tough on China, could inform a more uncompromising set of policies for years to come.

As Apple rolled out an advertising campaign last month touting the impenetrability of the iPhone — “Privacy. That’s iPhone”, the commercials promised — a secretive Israeli company called in its sales people to talk about an important update designed to thwart that very privacy.
According to one person at the meeting, the executives from NSO Group made a bold claim: using just one simple missed call on  WhatsApp, it had figured out a way to “drop its payload”, a piece of software called Pegasus that can penetrate the darkest secrets of any iPhone.
Within minutes of the missed call, the phone starts revealing its encrypted content, mirrored on a computer screen halfway across the world.
It then transmits back the most intimate details such as private messages and location, and even turns on the camera and microphone to live-stream meetings.
The software itself is not new — it was the latest upgrade to a decade-old technology so powerful that the Israeli defence ministry regulates its sale.
But the WhatsApp hack was an enticing new “attack vector”, the person says.
“Great from a sales point.”
It was an illustration of the sales pitch that NSO has made to governments around the world — and which has helped give a tiny and discreet company a market valuation of around $1bn.
NSO’s few hundred engineers claim they have managed to manoeuvre around whatever obstacle Apple, the world’s most valuable company, has thrown in its way.
Apple declined to comment for this article.
At an investor presentation in London in April, NSO bragged that the  typical security patches from Apple did not address the “weaknesses exploited by Pegasus”, according to an unimpressed potential investor.
Despite the annual software updates unveiled by companies such as Apple, NSO had a “proven record” of identifying new weaknesses, the company representative told attendees.
NSO’s pitch has been a runaway success — allowing governments to buy off the shelf the sort of software that was once thought to be restricted to only the most sophisticated spy agencies, such as GCHQ in the UK and the National Security Agency in America.
The sale of such powerful and controversial technologies also gives Israel an important diplomatic calling card.
Through Pegasus, Israel has acquired a major presence — official or not — in the deeply classified war rooms of unlikely partners, including, researchers say, Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Although both countries officially reject the existence of the Jewish state, they now find themselves the subject of  a charm offensive by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that mixes a shared hostility to Iran with intelligence knowhow.
The Israeli government has never talked publicly about its relationship with NSO. Shortly after he stepped down as defence minister in November, Avigdor Lieberman, who had responsibility for regulating NSO’s sales, said: “I am not sure now is the right time to discuss this . . . I think that I have a responsibility for the security of our state, for future relations.” But he added: “It is not a secret today that we have contact with all the moderate Arab world. I think it is good news.”
The NSO Group says Pegasus has been used by dozens of countries to prevent terrorist attacks, infiltrate drug cartels and help rescue kidnapped children.
But two lawsuits against the company, which have been filed in Israel and Cyprus, and build on investigations by human rights groups, claim it tracked the software to the phones of journalists, dissidents and critics of governments from Mexico to Saudi Arabia, including a researcher at Amnesty International, the wife of a murdered Mexican journalist and anti-corruption activists.
As the company has grown in influence, it has been tracked by researchers at the University of Toronto who have shadowed Pegasus.
They believe it has been used in 45 countries including Bahrain, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Half the group’s revenues come from the Middle East, according to an investor at the April presentation, although the company also told the gathering that it had contracts with 21 EU countries.
NSO’s technology has become a trophy weapon in the rivalries that consume the Middle East.
The Israeli lawsuit says the UAE, an NSO client, asked a company representative to hack the mobile phones of Qatar’s emir, a rival Saudi prince and the editor of a dissident newspaper in London.
The murder of  Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist, in Istanbul by Saudi government hitmen brought deeper scrutiny of the company.
Omar Abdulaziz, a Canada-based vocal critic of the Saudi government, and a friend of Khashoggi, alleges in one of the lawsuits in Israel that his phone was infiltrated by Pegasus, and was used to track Khashoggi’s conversations with him before his death in October.
NSO has offered a hedged response — saying publicly only that its software was not used by any of its clients to infect Khashoggi’s phone itself and that it only sells to responsible countries after diligent vetting, and with the approval of the Israeli government.
The company declined to comment on the record.
But on the question of its software being used by clients to monitor dissidents or journalists instead of legitimate terror targets, a person familiar with NSO says it does not see any of the data collected by its customers.
Instead, it has designed a firewall between its software, which it regularly updates and maintains, and the data it collects, which sits in separate servers located in the customer country, the person says.
NSO has also turned down potential business worth $150m in the past three years, and declined to pursue a further $250m in deals after work done by an ethics committee, which vets the customer government, its agencies, the human rights risks and the spy agency itself, the person says.
Few of the company’s critics are assuaged by these assurances.
“Its talk about careful customer selection seems like a joke, because it already has many contracts with states with very problematic human rights records, like Saudi Arabia,” says Alaa Mahajna, a Jerusalem-based human rights lawyer who is representing Mr Abdulaziz and a group of Mexican journalists and activists in two lawsuits against NSO.
In a previously unreported detail, NSO has been selling the ability to hack mobile phones in any part of the world — most recently using WhatsApp — with geographical software limitations decided by the Israeli government, according to a person familiar with the company.
That means that a spy agency in one country can theoretically hack phones well outside their jurisdiction.
In early May, engineers at WhatsApp discovered the vulnerability in its code that NSO was exploiting, and by last week had started to repair it, the company said.
It released an update to its 1.5bn users on Monday to completely close the loophole.
“This attack has all the hallmarks of a private company known to work with governments to deliver spyware that reportedly takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems,” says a person familiar with the internal WhatsApp investigation. “We are deeply concerned about the abuse of such capabilities.”
For a company with such unparalleled reach, NSO maintains a veil of secrecy — until recently, it did not have a website.
Its founders, Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie, rarely speak to the press — in a  2013 interview  with the FT, Mr Lavie said keeping the company private allowed “things that are secret to remain secret”.
But interviews with more than half a dozen Israeli officials, several people involved in NSO’s business, court documents in Israel and Cyprus, police complaints and wary investors show a company struggling to complete the transition from the shadows of Israel’s offensive tech industry to an astoundingly profitable enterprise that is now unveiling its secrets in investor presentations and buyout negotiations.
NSO was valued at about $1bn in a recent leveraged buyout backed by Novalpina Capital, a UK-based private equity fund.
It has launched a campaign to rehabilitate its reputation, which had taken such a hit that a $510m loan backing Novalpina’s leveraged buyout of the company  struggled to attract buyers even after trying to sell it for 90 cents on the dollar, with a 9.5 per cent interest rate.
The contracts with governments around the world are certainly lucrative.
The company reported $251m in revenues in 2018 — with an ebitda of $128m — up from revenue of $109m in 2014, according to its investor presentation.
Free cash flow was $80m in 2018.
About 10 per cent of revenues come from sales of a van that carries equipment to soak up the data from a target’s location.
Another tenth or so comes from a product called Landmark, which tracks the physical location of phones.
But the bestseller is still Pegasus, making up three-quarters of revenue.
The latest iteration of Pegasus is hugely attractive to governments.
In mid-2017, according to a police complaint in Israel and a European businessman who was involved in the sales pitch, NSO representatives flew to Cyprus to meet two senior Saudis, including a top intelligence official.
The businessman did not agree to make his name public.
In a conference room at the Four Seasons in Limassol, the company representatives had a brand new iPhone brought in and showed the Saudis how quickly they could hijack its camera and microphone.
The version they were marketing was nicknamed Pegasus 3, and it invades a phone without needing to trick the user into clicking on a hoaxed link hiding the software, marketed by the company as “zero click technology.”
“They were still discussing pricing, when the Saudis said they wanted it immediately,” says the businessman, who estimates the Saudi government paid $55m for the ability to track 150 targets simultaneously.
He never received a commission, and is pursuing a criminal complaint against two other middlemen involved in the deal.
The company says it does not discuss its clients or sales.
According to the businessman, the Saudi government also received some “horses”, as the company refers to the Trojan horse malware it loads on to target phones of Pegasus 2 — the same version that researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab tracked to the iPhone of Mr Abdulaziz, Khashoggi’s friend.
Speaking about the new WhatsApp hack, which its parent Facebook tried to patch with its latest update, John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, says: “If true, this is extremely concerning because it suggests that the same reckless behaviour from customers that Citizen Lab and others have documented could easily spill across borders. This suggests a novel new mechanism.”
The Mexican government had paid $32m in 2014 for Pegasus 2, according to a contract with the Mexican attorney-general’s office included in the lawsuit in Israel.
That came with an NSO service called Enhanced Social Engineering Message, in which NSO representatives helped create an enticing SMS that the target was most likely to click on, according to the lawsuit.
These messages are a central part of the two lawsuits facing NSO. Days after unknown assailants murdered  Mexican journalist Javier Valdez in 2017, who had been highly critical of the government, his widow received text messages that offered details on his murder. Citizen Lab concluded it was highly likely that the texts carried the malicious software. Mr Abdulaziz, in Canada, received a link that offered to track a shipment, which Citizen Lab said it had “high confidence” carried the malware. Others tracked by Citizen Lab received similarly personal, tailored messages. The company has declined to address the claims specifically, but has said that its internal investigations indicate that the software tracked by Citizen Lab is not Pegasus.
The creation of these messages required customers to work directly with NSO, says the businessman, who described a help desk based in Cyprus that worked with agencies.
That runs counter to NSO’s position that it sells the software in a manner that does not allow it to monitor how it is being used and on whom.
Novalpina has said that an exhaustive review turned up only a handful of abuses, and has suggested other companies or governments may be responsible for the traces of Pegasus that researchers claim to have tracked to the phones of journalists, dissidents and critics.
The lawsuits in Israel are still in pre-trial hearings, so the company has yet to present its formal defence.
In Israel, where the military has created its own secure phone for its officers to use, the susceptibility of smartphones has become a national security issue.
Many senior officials no longer carry smartphones — Mr Lieberman, the former defence minister, proudly showed off to reporters a scarred and cracked Nokia, at least a decade old, that his family can reach him on.
“These companies are telling the world that they made this product to make the world safer — but the people who know how these companies work stop using cell phones, and that doesn’t sound safer to me,” says Mr Scott-Railton at Citizen Labs.
Mr Lavie and Mr Hulio, the founders of NSO, have another company in the same game.
Its niche product?
Phones that cannot be hacked.

Investors are placing bets on a surge in market volatility around the G20 summit next month, as US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have downplayed the chances of a breakthrough in talks to resolve their trade dispute.
Bond yields have already plummeted, stock prices have fallen and the Vix index of market volatility has risen as hopes of a quick end to the dispute have been dashed.
Investors are now using derivatives markets to position themselves for further turbulence at the two-day summit.
Trading data show that investors have piled into options contracts expiring on Friday, June 28, the first day of the summit in Osaka, Japan, which would offer protection if stock prices plunge.
There are now more than 450,000 outstanding “put” contracts expiring on that date, compared with the more normal levels of 6,000 two days earlier and 8,000 on the following Monday, according to data from Macro Risk Advisors.
The increased investor caution comes as 10-year US Treasury yields plunged to their lowest level in 20 months on Wednesday as fears over slowing global growth have intensified after trade talks between the US and China broke up  in acrimony  this month, leading to an escalation of tariffs.
Mr Trump said conversations between Washington and Beijing would continue and he would meet with Mr Xi at the G20.
That encounter is at most expected to result in a new truce, setting the stage for a further round of negotiations.
Mr Trump this week said the US was “not ready” for a deal at this stage.
Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, and Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative, had been indicating they would visit Beijing for talks before the G20, but no such plans have been made.
If no truce is agreed at the G20, the US is expected to slap 25 per cent tariffs on a further $300bn of Chinese products, meaning all imports from the country would be subject to levies.
“The market is clearly pricing in risk around this event,” said Vinay Viswanathan, a derivatives strategist at Macro Risk Advisors. “If the US and China dialogue intensifies over the next few weeks it will only increase.”
Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said that investors were focusing on the G20 meeting as “the next milestone” in the trade dispute.
“There is a feeling in many of my client conversations that we will know more after that,” he said.
Analysts noted that the increased trading activity around the meeting could come both from investors seeking protection from a sharp downturn in stock prices and from others betting that markets will remain calm and taking the other side of the trade.
“Some of it is hedging the event, and some of it is investors knowing other people will care about the event,” said Pravit Chintawongvanich, an equity derivatives strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. “The market is definitely starting to focus more on it and its potential impact on markets.”
Another metric also indicates the G20 has become a focal point for speculation on the next steps in the trade war.
The Vix index — sometimes called Wall Street’s fear gauge because it typically rises as stock prices fall — has been elevated in recent weeks as trade tensions have intensified, reaching 17.9 on Wednesday, but it has been below 15 for most of the year and is indicated to fall back from current levels.
That is not true for the period around the G20, however.
The Vix level implied by prices of options expiring between June 28 and the following Friday currently stands at 17.6, compared with just 14.4 for the week after and 14.7 earlier in the month, according to data from Wells Fargo Securities.

Emilio Isais of Gonher, a Mexican auto parts company, has Donald Trump to thank for the meetings with US companies that he is looking forward to this week: America’s trade tensions with China could put some valuable business his way.
“Some US companies, big producers, are considering moving production from China to Mexico,” said Mr Isais, executive director of Gonher’s filter plant. “We could have some opportunities there. We don’t manufacture in China — we’re trying to get the extra business.”
His company is just one of the Mexico-based manufacturers that are seizing the chance to increase their exports to the US as the tariff war between Washington and Beijing heats up.
The value of Mexican imports to the US overtook that of those from China in March for the first time and Mexico is gaining a share of the US market as China’s flags.
In recent months, Mexico has studiously focused on promoting its trade with North America and on not antagonising its northern neighbour and top trading partner.
It has not succeeded in all areas — the US recently imposed a 17.5 per cent duty on Mexican tomatoes — but its manufacturing industry is benefiting.
“The US hitting China represents an opportunity [for Mexico] without a doubt,” said Ken Smith Ramos, Mexico’s chief negotiator for the USMCA trade pact, which was agreed last year to update the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement and now awaits ratification.
Exporters of engine filters, such as Gonher, are among the biggest winners from the US-China dispute, in which both sides have imposed tariffs of as much as 25 per cent on key exports from the other country. Mexican engine filter companies’ US market share rose 15.8 per centage points in March compared with the month earlier, while their Chinese competitors lost 9.3 points, according to data analysis by Mexican trade consultancy De la Calle Madrazo Mancera （CMM）.
Other beneficiaries include exporters of cash registers, car radios and vehicle air conditioning units. CMM managing director Luis de la Calle, a veteran Mexican trade negotiator, said these were the “unintended consequences” of Mr Trump’s spat with China. “We have noticed some improvement, a small increase in exports,” said Mr Isais. “Our clients have increased some orders.”
Mexico, whose economy has become highly integrated with the US under Nafta, stands to benefit from the US-Sino friction in three ways.
“You can replace China in the US and the US in China — if you look at the numbers for the last three months, that already shows,” said Mr de la Calle.
In addition, he said, Chinese and other Asian companies could also use Mexico as an export platform to reach the US.
Even if they do not comply with the rules of origin required to be able to export duty-free under Nafta, Chinese companies exporting out of Mexico would pay significantly lower tariffs than the punitive 25 per cent they would face when exporting from China.
Luis Enrique Zavala, director-general of the National Association of Importers and Exporters, said some companies had approached him to discuss using Mexico in this way.
They include makers of plastic toys, perfume makers, and textiles and electronics companies, which are considering distributing to their US and Latin American markets from Mexico.
In some cases this involves “redirecting [business] within the same company”, he said.
Mexico’s national confederation of chambers of commerce, Concanaco-Servytur, has also received inquiries regarding auto parts, electric vehicles, electronics and mobile phone components, its president José Manuel López Campos said.
“They are worried tariffs will continue to rise and are telling suppliers in China to increase exports to Mexico,” said Mr Zavala.
Even though Mr Trump recently settled a separate trade dispute with Mexico and Canada over steel and aluminium and has postponed the threat to levy tariffs on the auto sector, “that threat [on autos] is still there,” he added.
Furthermore, Rogelio Ramírez de la O, an independent economist, said the US Congress “has become more or less unified around the China issue . . . That means that companies that flew to China to invest and, in some instances, to manufacture in China and resell in the US, now have to have a very hard look at the fact this is a state policy now in the US and is going to remain”.
Replacing US exports to China is a trickier prospect but meat exports to Asia are on the rise.
Beef sales to Hong Kong rose 40 per cent last year, according to the Mexican Meat Council.
Companies and economists concede it is early days.
“I’m not hearing there is a massive move into Mexico yet, but Mexico is the natural recipient,” Mr Ramírez de la O said.
But Mr Isais at Gonher is already taking the longer-term view. “We don’t know if it will end soon,” he said. “But if [Mr] Trump gets re-elected, this could continue.”

The governor of China’s central bank sought to ease concerns on Thursday over the growing level of risk at troubled small banks in the country, following the first state takeover of a lender in 18 years.
Yi Gang of the People’s Bank of China, speaking at an event in Beijing, said the central bank was “fully capable” of managing risks at small banks, and that it planned to increase the supply of credit to small companies, according to local media and Bloomberg.
The remarks come just days after the central bank announced that regional lender Baoshang Bank would be taken over by the government for the next year in order to solve serious credit problems.
The news has revived concerns over the stability of China’s financial system, particularly over the thousands of municipal and rural lenders that constitute about a quarter of the country’s commercial banking assets.
It has also raised questions over the economic impact should some regional banks curtail lending to small and medium-sized companies.
The central bank has taken proactive measures over the past week to battle against potential cash crunches.
On Wednesday it said it would inject Rmb270bn （$39bn） into the market, the biggest open markets operation since January and a sign that the Baoshang incident had affected sentiment.
Fixed-income strategists have noted that the government’s decision to guarantee only up to Rmb50m of Baoshang’s interbank borrowings and corporate deposits earlier this week sent a strong signal to the market that regulators would not back all of the risks connected to the bank.
“Chinese interbank funding costs heated up after the takeover of Baoshang Bank,” said Cindy Huang, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings.
“Smaller banks’ wholesale funding costs through the bond market have also increased. If these costs remain elevated over a sustained period, smaller banks may have to pass the increase on to their borrowers.”
Mr Yi on Thursday noted that the government would make sure that small and medium-sized businesses had access to credit, saying that big banks would increase lending to SMEs by 30 per cent this year and the average cost of financing would come down by 1 percentage point.
Experts worry that more problems with smaller lenders could inhibit government efforts to maintain a flow of credit to small companies. That, in turn, could affect China’s overall economic growth rate this year, which is expected to slow to a 30-year low.
Katherine Lei, JPMorgan’s co-head of banks for Asia excluding Japan, noted that the troubles with Baoshang and other small banks “may lead to a rise in interbank funding cost and slowdown in liabilities growth of rural and city commercial banks, who are key lenders to SMEs. Thus, we expect their loan growth to slow down in the near term.”
The fall of Baoshang — once controlled by Xiao Jianhua, the Chinese billionaire abducted from Hong Kong by Chinese security services in 2017 — has raised questions over whether more small banks will face a similar fate.
Officials sounded the alarm earlier this year with a report from the National Audit Office that said some small banks faced non-performing loan rates of more than 40 per cent.
On Wednesday, Chinese language news reports, quoting unnamed officials, said that some rural commercial banks and city commercial banks were facing serious credit risks and were on the verge of technical bankruptcy.
The reports, however, were quickly removed from online.

Portugal on Thursday concluded the first sovereign debt sale on China’s bond market by a eurozone country, selling Rmb2bn in three-year paper at a yield of 4.09 per cent in an offer that attracted strong demand.
“With this successful transaction, Portugal has accessed the third largest bond market in the world to further diversify its investor base,” the IGCP, Portugal’s public debt agency, said in a statement.
The offer was targeted mainly at Chinese institutional investors.
It was the first issue of so-called Panda bonds by a eurozone sovereign and only the third by an EU country after Poland and Hungary issued renminbi-denominated debt in 2016 and 2018 respectively.
Orders for the bonds came in at over three times the amount on offer.
The IGCP said strong demand from investors allowed it to price the offer close to the lower range of the initial price guidance of 3.9-4.5 per cent, which had been announced on Tuesday.
During two years of preparation for the offer, Portugal, a former bailout country, presented its case to investors in Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore.
The Bank of China and HSBC were joint lead underwriters for the transaction.
Portugal’s CaixaBI acted as financial adviser.
Yield on Portugal’s 10-year bond stood at 0.85 per cent on Thursday.
That on the three-year note was at minus 0.23 per cent.

When financiers gathered at the Milken conference last month, a chart was passed around that should make policymakers, voters and investors rethink the nature of modern capitalism.
The chart showed that between 2000 and 2018 the number of private equity-backed companies in America rose from less than 2,000 to nearly 8,000.
Publicly listed companies in this period, by contrast, fell from 7,000 to about 4,000.
To be fair, the aggregate value of those private equity-backed companies is still “only” $5tn — far less than the combined $30tn value of US public companies.
But that $5tn number is striking, not least because it excludes a vast swath of other privately held groups.
What is doubly notable is that the explosion of private activity is not restricted to equities.
In the past decade, private debt markets have expanded at a striking clip, totalling more than $600bn today.
Private infrastructure and real estate investment is also expanding.
Indeed, Willis Towers Watson calculated a couple of years ago that global asset owners have now placed about 14 per cent of their assets in private markets （mostly private equity and real estate）, up from virtually nothing a couple of decades ago.
They predict this will rise to 20 per cent in 10 years.
Some observers, such as Henry Fernandez, chief executive of MSCI, think it could be considerably higher.
MSCI is so convinced that this drift toward private finance is here to stay that it is quietly developing indices and portfolio tools to help investors track these private securities and assets.
The group thinks that this could be one of the hottest new frontiers of finance in the coming years.
That is notable given that MSCI has forged a name for itself as a champion for public markets, expanding its equity and bond indices around the world.
“Historically investments were about private markets. In the last century that changed and institutional money went into public markets,” Mr Fernandez says. “Maybe we should ask if . . . we are reverting more to the historical norm?”
If so, that would overturn many of the current presumptions about modern finance.
In the 20th century, it was often assumed that public markets were the epitome of financial capitalism; indeed, the idea was so deeply ingrained that policymakers and financiers tended to assume that financial evolution went in one direction: from private to public.
But today the trend towards private finance is being driven by “pull” and “push” factors.
On the one hand, private equity, real estate and debt investments have often offered better returns than public equity in the past decade.
And while these sectors used to be run like cottage industries, they are maturing — or at least aping some elements of public markets with slightly better reporting.
Hence the desire of MSCI and others to jump in.
At the same time, the raison d'être for public markets is faltering.
They used to be seen as a more democratic and inclusive form of capitalism （because securities owners had a voice）, offering more transparency （since there was more reporting） and liquidity （with more trading）.
It was also thought that if corporate managers faced the wisdom of （shareholder） crowds, companies would be better run.
But the spread of dual class listings, which give a few owners disproportionate power, is undermining the idea of shareholder democracy.
Meanwhile, critics argue that the rise of activist investors and quarterly corporate reporting has fostered a more short-term corporate culture.
Liquidity in public equity and bond markets has sharply declined since 2008, while financing for private deals has grown.
Maybe this is just a fad, driven by cheap money. It is unclear how the recent boom in private finance will perform if （or when） the credit cycle turns. “The returns on private equity do not look sustainable — they are already falling,” points out William Lee, chief economist at Milken. This is not reassuring, particularly since no amount of hype about new “investor friendly” tools and indices can change the fact that private finance is private — and thus prone to be opaque and illiquid.
There are two key points that investors need to ponder.
Firstly, the tale should act as an urgent wake-up call for policymakers to begin addressing the all-too-visible shortcomings of public markets — particularly if they believe, as I do, that public markets remain the best way to create participatory and democratic capitalism.
Second, we cannot assume that history follows a straight line.
In finance — as in politics — the pendulum can sometimes swing in some surprising ways; and not always in a manner that represents “progress”.

Brazil’s vice-president went to Beijing on a delicate and sensitive mission: to rescue the relationship with his country’s biggest trading partner, strained by repeated anti-China comments from his rightwing nationalist boss, President Jair Bolsonaro.
By the time  Hamilton Mourão  returned home from last week’s state visit, which included a meeting with Xi Jinping, his trip was already being hailed as a diplomatic success.
From the globally sensitive subject of  Huawei’s market access to reinvigorating Chinese investment in Brazil’s stuttering economy, Mr Mourão’s diplomatic offensive set the scene for a deeper partnership between the eastern and western hemisphere’s largest developing nations, say analysts, officials and members of his delegation.
“The visit symbolises the end of a period of unprecedented uncertainty in the bilateral relationship,” said Oliver Stuenkel, an expert on the Bric nations at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas in São Paulo. “It is quite remarkable how Mourão has convinced his Chinese interlocutors that he can control Bolsonaro when it comes to China.”
With a combined population of more than 1.6bn people, the trade relationship between Brazil and China is among the world’s  most important , particularly at a time of rising US-China tension.
China needs Brazil’s soyabeans, iron ore and crude oil to fuel its economy, the world’s second largest.
As Beijing cut back purchases of US soyabeans last year, Brazil’s exports surged 30 per cent.
The Latin American giant is keen to remain attractive for Chinese investment, with deals involving Chinese companies exceeding $10bn in both 2016 and 2017.
“The Brazil-China relationship has been evolving from pure trade to a more complex and sophisticated investment/partnership relationship,” said Su Jung Ko, founder of Golden Hawk Consulting, which advises Asian buyers on mergers and acquisitions in Brazil. “Brazil [is] an attractive market for Chinese investors due to its size, domestic market and huge natural resources.”
This relationship, however, turned decidedly frosty last year upon the election of Mr Bolsonaro, who is frequently critical of China and what he sees as Beijing’s debt-trap diplomacy.
Ahead of the vote in October, he said: “What we need is to become aware that China is buying Brazil, not buying in Brazil, it is buying Brazil.”
The then-candidate also took a trip to Taiwan, raising fears in China that he might, upon election, consider formally recognising what Beijing regards as a renegade province.
Amid the furore, Chinese mergers and acquisitions in Brazil dropped sharply to about $200m* last year, down from $11bn the year before, according to data from Dealogic.
Many of Mr Bolsonaro’s closest advisers, including his sons, favour a tough stance on China and have been pushing the Brazilian leader to focus on developing relations with Donald Trump instead.
Since his inauguration in January, Mr Mourão, a 65-year-old retired general, has resisted these forces, preferring quiet diplomacy to regain the support of Beijing and show he can temper Mr Bolsonaro’s anti-China impulses.
“He is pro-China and very clear in his thinking,” said a member of Mr Mourão’s delegation to Beijing. “Nobody [in Brazil] wants to fight China, especially the agribusiness sector. There will be pragmatism.”
In Beijing, the vice-president managed to strike the appropriate notes to satisfy his local audience as well as the Brazilian businessmen in his delegation.
While restarting a suspended vice presidential-level “co-ordination commission”, Mr Mourão lobbied for China to open its markets to “value-added” Brazilian imports, including jets from Embraer.
“Brazil cannot be just a store that China goes and buys items. It has to be more than that. Things that come from Brazil have to have the same value as those coming from China,” he said.
However, on sensitive issues, such as Huawei’s market access, Mr Mourão played to his audience: “We see Huawei with good eyes . . . Huawei is established in Brazil and will make more investments.”
The US is currently pressing Brazil to join it in banning Huawei from participating in the rollout of 5G mobile network infrastructure.
Brasília is expected to make a decision later this year or early next year after Mr Bolsonaro meets Mr Xi in August.
Few, however, anticipate an outright ban.
In a sign of China’s interest in nurturing relations with Brazil, Mr Mourão was given an audience with Mr Xi, an unusual shift of diplomatic protocol.
While avoiding a concrete commitment, Mr Mourão also voiced support for China’s trademark One Belt One Road development strategy, which has seen Beijing already pump billions of dollars into infrastructure projects around the world.
“We are following this with high expectations and we are open to proposals for investments in infrastructure, which is what interests us,” the Brazilian vice-president said.
But on his return home Mr Mourão still has to contend with domestic politics.
Many in Brasília, including Mr Bolsonaro, believe the nation should throw its ideological support behind the US, particularly given its ongoing trade tensions with China.
“We want to sell [China] soyabeans and iron ore, but we will not sell our soul. That is a very clear principle,” said Ernesto Araújo, Brazil’s foreign minister, earlier this year.

The United States will impose tariffs on all Mexican goods from next month, the Trump administration said late on Thursday, in an attempt to pressure its neighbour to halt an influx of migrants illegally crossing the border between the two countries.
President Donald Trump said in a statement that US customs officials will begin imposing duties of 5 per cent on Mexican imports from June 10.
These tariffs will rise in stages to as much as 25 per cent by October 1, where they will stay permanently, if the Mexican government does not present a solution to what the Trump administration describes as an “extraordinary  threat to the national security and economy of the United States”.
“The United States of America has been invaded by hundreds of thousands of people coming through Mexico and entering our country illegally,” the White House statement read. “This sustained influx of illegal aliens has profound consequences on every aspect of our national life—overwhelming our schools, overcrowding our hospitals, draining our welfare system, and causing untold amounts of crime.”
The news prompted the Mexican peso to fall as much as 2.4 per cent versus the dollar, before paring losses to about 1.7 per cent.
S&P 500 stock futures fell 0.9 per cent.
Mr Trump earlier this year declared a  state of emergency over the migrant situation at the US-Mexico border, in a bid to bypass Congress and secure funds for a border wall between the two nations.
Mr Trump has also previously threatened to close the land border, the world’s busiest, altogether.
Almost  half a million migrants were apprehended crossing the border in 2018, a six-year high.

African swine fever took a while to arrive in the green hills of Guangdong, in southern China.
But when it did it came with a vengeance.
The first government-confirmed cases appeared late last year.
Authorities responded by culling more than 6,000 pigs and offering farmers compensation — the playbook developed elsewhere in China, where the disease has ravaged the country’s once 400m-strong pig population.
There have been no official cases confirmed in Guangdong since Christmas Day.
Yet a trip to the outskirts of Guangzhou, the province’s flourishing capital city, shows the difficulty of containing the disease.
As ASF has spread further south in China and on into south-east Asia, questions have arisen whether Beijing’s response inadvertently helped to compound the problem and flooded domestic markets with potentially contaminated meat.
“No pigs here, they’re all dead,” said the groundskeeper at the otherwise empty grounds of Guangzhou City Fine Breed Pig Farm.
An outbreak of the virus hit the compound in March, he said.
Fine Breed is not the only farm with an unacknowledged outbreak; analysts say farmers in China have taken to sending entire herds to the slaughterhouse at the first sign of ASF, rather than report to the government and receive too little compensation.
The resulting oversupply helps explain why spot wholesale prices for Chinese pork have risen only about 8 per cent since August, while Chicago hog futures are up more than 35 per cent.
“At the local level there are strong incentives not to report cases,” said Ernan Cui, China consumer analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing. Ms Cui said the impact on pork prices from so-called “panic slaughtering” usually finished working through markets around six months later. She tipped pork reductions from the latest round of killing, which began sometime in December, to become evident in the second half of 2019.
ASF, which is fatal to pigs but harmless to humans, showed up in north-east China last August, following outbreaks in Siberia the summer before. Once it had a foothold in China the disease swept swiftly south, reaching Hong Kong in May. This month, epidemiologists told Science magazine that it would soon surface in Myanmar and Laos, with the potential to become an epidemic in south-east Asia.
In February, pig breeder Sun Dawu in Hebei province took to Chinese social media to insist that he had lost 15,000 hogs to the disease.
“We believe it’s African swine fever . . . please will the government give us a way out!” his staff wrote on a banner in a photo posted online by Mr Sun, along with a gruesome photo of piles of dead pigs.
Mr Sun’s case is one of the few known to have received confirmation from China’s Ministry of Agriculture after initially being rejected at the local level.
This year, a third of China’s national pig stock, the biggest in the world, could be wiped out by the disease, according to Rabobank estimates, sending shockwaves through protein markets across the globe.
John Lin, portfolio manager of China equities at fund manager AllianceBernstein, said expectations of better margins had boosted the share prices of Chinese pork producers listed onshore, such as Jiangxi Zhengbang Technology, which has more than tripled so far this year.
While shortfalls would probably drive Chinese consumers to eat more alternatives such as soyabean-based tofu, he said, “ironically demand for [products like soya] will actually go down because you have a lot fewer hog mouths to feed”.
Part of the reason for the fever’s rapid spread in China may have been a poorly designed compensation scheme.
When the disease first appeared, authorities ordered herds to be culled and, in an effort to ensure farmers reported outbreaks, ordered payments of Rmb1,200 （$174） a head for those who lost animals.
However, cash-strapped local governments balked at paying out so much, forming a perverse incentive for farmers to sell their herds as soon as one pig fell ill rather than report outbreaks and risk a heavier loss.
Dirk Pfeiffer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who studies the disease and trains veterinarians in China, said a lack of transparency on domestic outbreaks had turned the situation into “a complete fog”.
At the Guangzhou Fine Breed farm, educational posters exhort the culling and disposing of afflicted pigs. But the groundsman was adamant: “We sold them!” Butchers at wet markets in Guangzhou, equally, insisted that their meat passed muster. “It’s been inspected — inspected!” said one butcher near the city centre, thwacking his hand against government-issued papers for emphasis.
Yet expectations of higher pork prices have begun boosting interest among farmers, Ms Cui said, as evidenced by the price of piglets climbing rapidly since March.
When the shortage hits, said Mr Lin, China will pull in pork from the rest of the world, and poorer countries from Brazil to Bulgaria will feel the squeeze from higher prices.
“There simply isn’t enough animal protein in the world to fill this void.”

Malaysia’s prime minister has said the country will make use of Huawei’s technology, even as the US has blacklisted the Chinese telecoms maker and encouraged its allies to avoid using its equipment on national security grounds.
Mahathir Mohamad said at a Nikkei conference in Tokyo that the Southeast Asian country would “try to make use of their technology as much as possible” as Huawei’s research capability was “far bigger” than Malaysia’s overall research ability.
Mr Mahathir dismissed national security concerns over Huawei.
“Yes there may be some spying, but what is there to spy in Malaysia? We are an open book,” he said.
Donald Trump’s administration placed Huawei on its prohibitive “ entity list” that effectively bars US companies from selling technology to the Chinese telecoms maker earlier this month.
Huawei has warned the blacklist will hit about  1,200 US suppliers.
In February, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, warned that if a country adopts Huawei technology in some of its critical information systems “we won’t be able to share information with them, we won’t be able to work alongside them”.
However, the UK is set to allow Huawei to build some  non-core parts of Britain’s 5G data network.
Mr Mahathir said China had excelled in scientific research and that the US must now compete with China and accept that the capability to carry out research and development now exists in Asia.
“But if you want to have a situation where you are always ahead,” he added. “[That] if you are ahead I will ban you, I will send warships to your country. That is not competition, that is threatening people.”

That’s it?
A much-anticipated debate about the trade war between a Chinese television host and an American peer left an avid audience in the Asian country underwhelmed and complaining that it was all over far too soon.
The livestream of the debate on the Fox Business Network between Trish Regan and Liu Xin, a journalist for state-run China Global Television Network, repeatedly slowed and pixelated as millions of Chinese logged in to watch.
The debate rose rapidly among hot topics on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, garnering 130m followers on Thursday morning.
Viewers complained that it was over too fast, finishing after 16 minutes of a soft-spoken, polite exchange of views in English. “This is too short. What the hell can you debate about?,” griped one Weibo user. “I have been looking forward to seeing this for so many days.”
Ms Regan challenged Ms Liu to appear on her show after the she posted a detailed rebuttal to a diatribe against China by the US television host earlier this month. CGTN said on Wednesday it was not able to livestream the segment, citing copyright issues with Fox in a move that disappointed the many Chinese who were rooting for Ms Liu.
The debate fed into a hunger in China for more information on a clash that threatens to dismantle years of integration between the world’s two biggest economies.
“Chinese college students care a lot about current affairs and they spend a lot of time discussing these issues,” said a recent graduate, who identified himself only as Jack.
Trade talks between the US and China broke down this month, triggering a broadside of articles in China's state-run media against US “bullying. In addition to raising tariffs, the US has put Huawei, the Chinese telecoms group, on a blacklist that prevents US companies from providing it with components or services, threatening to cripple a company seen as a national champion by Beijing.
The trade war has also unleashed a tug of war on the Chinese internet, between nationalists defending their country’s pride and those who feel Beijing’s propaganda is too heavy-handed.
For the most part, the two anchors rehashed their countries’ positions: Ms Regan pushed on allegations of Chinese intellectual property theft and Ms Liu argued for open trade and investment into China.
Ms Liu acknowledged some IP violations but pointed out that US companies sue each other over such claims too.
Both women agreed that lower tariffs would be preferable to the current situation.
The US has slapped tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports and Beijing has retaliated with its own levies.
“It was very peaceful. There’s no smell of gunpowder as expected,” well-known blogger Guda Baihua told his 12m followers on Weibo, with a hint of disappointment.

Two weeks after Huawei was put on a blacklist that prevents US suppliers from selling components to the telecoms company, companies across the world are still working out the ramifications.
Last week, Huawei told the Financial Times that the Trump administration’s decision to put the company on its “entity list” would affect about 1,200 US suppliers.
Huawei bought roughly $11bn in components and services from US companies last year.
The ban has had significant consequences for Huawei’s suppliers.
As well as preventing US companies from selling directly to Huawei, it also stops third-party companies from selling products with more than one-quarter US-originated technology to Huawei.
Analysts say companies are likely to dispute what products fall under the re-sale ban.
The uncertainty over the affects of the ban has led some phone operators to delay the launch of new Huawei smartphones while they make further assessments.
In the UK, EE and Vodafone have “paused” the launch of Huawei’s 5G smartphones, while two of Japan’s largest mobile phone carriers, SoftBank and KDDI, have also suspended presales of the new Huawei P30 phones.
Huawei is highly dependent on the US for the design of the chips it uses in its smartphones and telecoms equipment.
Even though Huawei uses its own in-house chip design unit — HiSilicon — to design “system on a chip” chips for its  high end smartphones, HiSilicon requires US-made software to make the designs.
Moreover, HiSilicon and other chip designers use core chip architecture patented by ARM, a UK-based company owned by SoftBank that has said it can no longer license its designs to Huawei.
Google has already said it will stop supplying Huawei with software for the Android operating system that runs three-quarters of the world’s mobile phones.
Fortunately for Huawei, its main producer of smartphone chips, Taiwan’s TSMC, has said it will continue to supply the company because it does not think it is in violation of the US ban by using US-made chip fabrication equipment to make Huawei’s chips.
But in addition to relying on TSMC for HiSilicon’s chips, Huawei also uses memory chips made by Micron and Seagate, both US companies.
When it comes to telecoms equipment such as mobile masts, Huawei relies on logic chips called field-programmable gate arrays （FGPAs） made by US company Xilinx.
The other major FGPA suppliers, Intel’s Alterra and Lattice Semiconductor, are also US companies.
Huawei has built up semiconductor stockpiles in anticipation of the ban.
Market research firm CLSA estimates the company has six months of smartphone inventory and nine to 12 months of 5G base station inventory.
Although China’s government has been pushing hard for self-sufficiency in semiconductor design and manufacturing in light of a previous US ban that crippled Huawei’s competitor ZTE, there are barely any domestic options for Huawei to turn to after its inventories run out.
Analysts reckon China is more than 10 years behind in designing high-end logic chips of the kind used in Huawei’s switches and routers.

Kenji Sukeno, president of Fujifilm Holdings, has three of the company’s top selling cameras spread out in front of him.
One, which delivers a print within seconds, bears the signature of Taylor Swift — a reminder that this venerable company can still produce a product with demonstrable appeal to the “selfie generation”.
But since the turn of the century, Mr Sukeno, who joined the group more than 40 years ago, has helped to set a dramatic new trajectory, as the spread of digital technology threatened to render its core business close to obsolete.
Its expertise, acquired through decades as one of the leading global photographic companies, has been harnessed to build a substantial presence in two distinct, but connected, businesses: life sciences and cosmetics.
The challenge he and the leadership team faced was to persuade a workforce accustomed to guarding the company’s proprietary technology from competitors to embrace a far more transparent approach.
It also needed to find new markets through a spate of targeted acquisitions.
As early as the mid-1980s the company became “acutely aware” of how disruptive the rise of digital technology would be, says Mr Sukeno, and started “taking measures”.
In any conversation about companies’ ability to ride out digital disruption, the name of Fujifilm’s US rival Eastman Kodak inevitably looms large: its failure to press home an initial advantage on digital photography, eventually leading to a bankruptcy protection filing in 2012, has earned it an unwelcome place in the management textbooks.
It was not a mistake that Mr Sukeno and his company would make.
As the millennium dawned, he says, it was clear that demand for conventional film was going to disappear in the next 10 years.
“So that’s when we faced the crisis,” he adds.
In 2004 the company began an “inventory check of Fujifilm’s technological expertise . . . We started researching which areas we should go into in order to survive, leveraging technology,” Mr Sukeno says.
Underpinning this approach was a conviction that it could not accomplish its turnround sufficiently rapidly if it sought simultaneously to repurpose its technologies and to create new markets: it must acquire a new customer base through M&A.
Mr Sukeno encapsulates how the company was thinking at the time: “We are trying to climb the mountain, but if you go from the bottom all the way to the peak, it’s going to take a long time. So we will charter a helicopter, which will take us to somewhere close to the peak.” The sum it has invested in M&A “for the helicopter”, he adds with a smile, stands at about ¥1tn （$9bn）.
All of the businesses into which it has expanded post-2000 are linked to its materials science capabilities, acquired from years of making photo film.
If the business strategy was achieved through hard-headed acquisition and partnership, convincing the staff that a change of tack was vital demanded diplomacy and a human touch.
“In the old days we were concentrating on making something better than other companies,” he says. With only a few players in the field “there was an oligopoly. So if we came up with a new product then, the world had to buy that product,” he says.
As digital technology disrupted the company’s model, he realised that “a mindset change” was required: the company must become attuned to the needs of its potential customers and actively seek to come up with solutions to their problems.
Under the guidance of Shigetaka Komori, Fujifilm’s chairman, a strategy to win over employees was devised.
“We were acutely aware that this was very difficult [for staff], but we persuaded people that if we didn’t do what we were planning to do, then we would not be able to survive.”
Mr Sukeno’s pitch was clear.
“What I suggested was that we open Fujifilm’s technical capability to the world, so that the world can look at it and then come to us saying, ‘If we combine Fujifilm’s technology and our technology, we can come up with this particular solution’. This is what I suggested to them.”
Scientists in the R&D division were the toughest to persuade “because I think they understood, but their heart wasn’t quite with it”, given their history of “black box” development of products, he says.
The result is a company reborn.
In the financial year that ended in 2001, 19 per cent of revenue came from photographic film.
By 2018 that had dwindled to just 1 per cent.
Meanwhile, “photo-related” services, including digital cameras, made up 16 per cent of revenue in the year to March 2018 — compared with 54 per cent 17 years earlier.
Along the way there has been pain for employees who have lost their jobs — including 10,000 who went in the restructuring of Fuji Xerox, a joint venture between Fujifilm and Xerox, in 2018 — and uncertainty for remaining staff who have had to integrate new colleagues with different skills into the workforce.
Mr Sukeno says that the key to managing the post-merger integration was “to communicate with the new companies with respect and share [a] clear goal and vision”.
Another leadership challenge he faced was the discovery in 2017 of accounting irregularities at its sales subsidiaries in New Zealand and Australia.
Soon after the problem was revealed, he says, Fujifilm set up both internal and independent external investigations.
A series of governance changes followed, including integration of the accounting divisions of Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox into Fujifilm Holdings.
He says he sought personally to reinforce the company’s “open, fair and clear” corporate culture at compliance sessions held for the management of each Fujifilm Group company.
However, the episode seems to have exposed a need to spell out the ethos more directly: “Out of this, we learnt that making communication more active among managers and non-managers, departments and organisations, and all employees, would be important for the further growth of the Fujifilm Group,” he adds.
One current piece of attempted M&A is proving less than plain sailing.
A year ago a deal which would have seen Fujifilm merge with Xerox, the printer and photocopying company, was announced, only to hit the rocks after two of its biggest investors fiercely opposed the tie-up.
Mr Sukeno makes clear that he is still hoping the deal will proceed — the company would be “be better off with this transaction” — even as he insists that it is “not something absolutely necessary for Fujifilm’s growth”.
He seems prepared to play a waiting game, adding: “We don’t expect to spend time on this forever, but we are in no rush.”
Hovering over the conversation is the ghost of Kodak.
Asked about the differences between the companies, he suggests they go beyond the simple fact of Fujifilm’s more focused strategy: there is an element that reflects the very different approaches to the role of business in society.
In the US, he suggests, when technologies that support a company’s core business become obsolete “the general thinking goes [that] this company should also disappear . . . The investment made into this company should be repatriated to the investors, and then the investors should invest in other emerging companies with the new technology.”
The thinking in Japan is different, he says: “The company’s very much seen as the vehicle which supports other people’s lives.”

Fund services group InterTrust says the number of China-linked private equity and venture capital fund launches it has handled over the past six months has fallen sharply with the worsening of the trade war between Washington and Beijing.
The warning from the Netherlands-based company, which was controlled by Blackstone until its sale earlier this year, comes as Asian investors increasingly fear the next frontier in the trade war will be the financial sector.
InterTrust Funds started to see the impact of the trade war on China-focused funds and China-based funds investing abroad in December.
The number of private equity and venture capital fund launches handled by the group has halved every month since then, from an average of about 10 per month last year to about two or three now, said James Donnan, managing director of InterTrust’s Hong Kong office.
“For those that do launch and close successfully, we are seeing delays in investments as they sit and watch what is happening,” Mr Donnan said at the annual China Private Equity Summit in Hong Kong.
Earlier this month, US president Donald Trump sharply increased tariffs on Chinese goods, a move that drew retaliation from Beijing.
Mr Trump followed up by blacklisting Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker, sparking concerns he could take similar action against a wider range of companies.
The gap between the world’s two largest economies on the trade war was now so wide that a deal was looking less likely, said Mr Donnan.
“I don’t think a deal will be done in June or November. This is the new normal,” Mr Donnan said. “We are not facing barriers or bumps navigating the China trade tensions. That was eight to nine months ago. We are [now] on a totally different road.”
His comment came as JD Digits, the financial spin-off of JD.com, China’s largest publicly listed retailer by revenue, warned that the trade war risked extending into the financial industry.
News this week that Alibaba, which is already listed in New York, was considering a $20bn dual-listing in Hong Kong to diversify its market exposure away from the US, has added to expectations that the US might target mainland companies on Wall Street.
Such fears gained traction after Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, said last week that Washington should rethink China’s role in US stock markets due to issues with transparency.
“We are at a critical time to prevent the trade war turning into a finance war,” said Shen Jianguang, vice-president and chief economist at JD Digits. “It’s quite important to prevent this from happening.”
Dr Shen said he expected Alibaba to start a trend for Chinese companies to return to Hong Kong to list.
One prominent Chinese venture capital group, which invests in healthcare companies around the world, said on condition of anonymity that it was now looking at alternative regions such as south-east Asia thanks to an increasingly hostile environment in the US.
This was partly due to increasing scrutiny of China-US deals by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius.
“A lot of American entities are pushing back or refusing to have relationships with us. New regulations by Cfius have made investing in US companies very hard as well,” the investor said.
Investors in funds are also being hit by falling valuations, particularly in China’s tech sector.
Brian Snyder, mergers and acquisitions of counsel for Morrison & Foerster in Asia, said he had not seen deal flow change as a result of the US-Sino tensions but he was seeing lower prices.
“We are seeing some down-round valuations which [provides] a bit of a chill but companies are still starting up and trying to raise capital,” Mr Snyder said.

Before taking off for Tokyo last week, Donald Trump threw a bone to investors fretting about the fate of negotiations to end the US trade dispute with China, which have taken a negative turn.
The US president said there remained a “good possibility” that an agreement would be reached. But, more importantly, he added that a deal could include a resolution to the stand-off over Huawei, the Chinese telecoms network company accused by the US of violating sanctions, stealing intellectual property and practising espionage.
The timing of Mr Trump’s intervention was as remarkable as it was incongruous.
Just a week earlier, the US had placed Huawei on a commerce department special blacklist of foreign entities that are considered risky from a national security perspective — sharply tightening export controls on sales to the Chinese company from the US.
So why did Mr Trump do it?
One explanation may be that he wanted to juice the markets again on a day when they had fallen sharply amid worries about the risk of a full-blown US-China trade war.
Another is simply that Mr Trump sees Huawei as a bargaining chip, rather than as an existential menace.
From a practical perspective, there is no obstacle to Mr Trump playing the Huawei card in the trade talks if national security is invoked.
He could instruct William Barr, the attorney-general, to drop the charges against the company and Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer under house arrest in Canada, and in her case withdraw the extradition request.
Although the US justice system prides itself on being clear of government interference, those lines have been blurred in the past in extreme cases — and that could happen again.
From a political and economic perspective, however, Mr Trump may have reached the point of no return on Huawei, and backtracking would be problematic.
For one thing, China hawks on Capitol Hill and within Mr Trump’s political base have been delighted with the blacklisting of Huawei, and would be severely disappointed if Mr Trump let the company off the hook.
Mr Trump would also face criticism that he had damaged the credibility and independence of US authorities which have taken on Huawei over the years.
On the corporate side, American businesses have scaled back their Chinese sourcing and investment in favour of third countries — especially in the advanced technology sector — a process that was neatly captured by Paul Triolo of Eurasia Group in a note last week.
“For Chinese companies, the lesson is, reduce your dependence on the global ICT supply chain, or risk exposing your future viability to long-arm actions by the US,” Mr Triolo said. “For US suppliers, it is reduce your exposure to Chinese customers and suppliers to avoid running afoul of US authorities.”
Mr Trump often gets away with performing big policy U-terms, but a settlement on Huawei would take the biscuit.

Foreign investors beware: a byzantine regulatory framework and patchy trading volumes could cause a shock in the country’s debt market, say analysts — just as Beijing is opening it up to outsiders.
Three years ago a domestic brokerage called Sealand Securities suffered huge losses on a highly leveraged financing deal which was funded by banks.
When the investment went sour and Sealand defaulted on its loans, banks pulled credit from brokers and other nonbank financial institutions.
The mini-meltdown led to interbank lending rates shooting up and liquidity in the bond market evaporating.
“It took a few days to figure out what had actually happened,” said one foreign investor who weathered the December 2016 storm, noting that regulatory transparency was low at the time.
Since then foreign investment in the country’s bond market has nearly tripled to about $300bn, but for some investors the incident cuts to the heart of the risks lurking in the system.
Despite China’s status as the world’s third-largest bond market, foreign investors complain that bond holdings are highly concentrated among a circle of large government institutions that rarely trade them.
As a result, some worry the market is still prone to shocks like the Sealand incident.
“There’s a handful of institutions providing liquidity to the market and if one of them stops, there could be a crisis,” said Ron Thompson, a managing director at Alvarez & Marsal Asia and former chief credit officer for Standard Chartered in China.
The concerns are particularly pressing for global investors this year, following the inclusion of Chinese government bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate index, the first such move by a major global index provider.
That alone could usher in foreign capital flows of $150bn by 2021, and other indices such as the FTSE Russell's World Government Bond Index are expected to follow suit, according to S&P Global.
The Chinese government has welcomed the development, which fits with its goal of gradually expanding foreign participation in the country’s capital markets while promoting the use of its currency internationally.
Since 2003, regulators have cautiously opened up various channels for foreign capital to reach the domestic market.
Central banks and sovereign wealth funds, for example, were granted unlimited access to the interbank bond market in 2010 and a “bond connect” scheme allowing Hong Kong-based investors to buy onshore bonds, was launched in 2017.
“From our perspective the positives now far outweigh the negatives,” said Kenneth Akintewe, head of Asian sovereign debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments, noting improved access to the market.
Regulators have also sought to allay many of the fears keeping out foreign capital, starting with improvements to the interbank market, where most bonds are traded and 90 per cent of bond financing occurs.
The liquidity profile of the interbank market has been improved over the past five years but some sources of volatility remain, said Richard Xu, chief China financial sector analyst at Morgan Stanley.
The People’s Bank of China has put in place several lending mechanisms that act as a last resort for banks, in the hope of reducing the chances of a system-wide credit crunch.
But some warn that glitches in the market are a sign of the central bank’s ambition to control both the quality and the quantity of credit in the system.
“Certainly [volatility is] still hard to avoid because they are still trying to target both credit volume and [interest] rates,” Mr Xu said. “They are still in a transition period. If the rates become the key policy tool while de-emphasising the pace of credit growth, they can fully fix the problem. But they are not there yet.”
Another strain on liquidity is created by China’s commercial banks, which tend to buy and hold bonds to maturity, rarely trading or becoming market-makers.
Foreign investors looking to actively trade debt in China can often struggle to find willing counterparties.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission is trying to solve part of the problem by encouraging more active trading among domestic banks.
The regulator is in the process of drafting rules that will allow domestic commercial banks to trade in bond futures— changes that are expected this year, according to people familiar with the plans.
“[Beijing] will need to further diversify the holding of Chinese government bonds, and let greater access to futures by banks and insurers to enable more trading strategies,” said Becky Liu, China fixed-income strategist at Standard Chartered.
Another challenge to overseas investors comes from China’s peculiar regulatory framework, where six different bodies control different patches of the market.
For example, the ministry of finance oversees government bonds, while the banking regulator, the securities regulator and the central bank have responsibility for financial bonds.
The IMF called for a “harmonisation” of regulation in a paper earlier this year but market participants think competition among the agencies will prevent that in the short term.
“I don’t see this happening anytime soon,” said the head of Asia capital markets at a global bank. “This is all about power.”
Given all these risks, investors are keeping a close eye on the yields they can achieve within China compared with investing in the same Chinese issuers in the offshore market.
Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions and client advisory for BNP Paribas Asset Management in Asia-Pacific, said he was steering clear.
“Is it worth it to go onshore to get that minor premium but pick up all the risks as well?” Mr Sandhu said. “For right now I think the answer is no.”

Washington’s move to blacklist Huawei is set to hit about 1,200 US suppliers to the Chinese telecoms group, including companies that provide most of the backbone of the company’s cyber security system.
Senior executives told the Financial Times that the Trump administration’s decision to add the Chinese group and 68 affiliates to its prohibitive “entity list”, which in effect bars US companies from selling to them, would have ramifications beyond Huawei.
The ban is due to come into force in mid-August, following a three-month reprieve granted by Donald Trump, the US president, to allow American companies to manage the disruption.
Huawei, which is already facing the prospect of being shut out of Google’s Android smartphone operating system, warned that the impact of the ban could extend beyond handsets to software used in its equipment and other businesses.
“It is a huge impact but not a crisis because we have been preparing for this since a long time ago,” said Dang Wenshuan, Huawei’s chief strategy architect, in an interview.
Huawei’s vulnerabilities to a sudden loss of access to US suppliers include two critical areas: cyber security and semiconductors, according to people with knowledge of the company’s operations.
Two-thirds of the 19 commercial cyber security software tools that Huawei uses come from US suppliers and one-quarter of the roughly 200m smartphones it shipped last year contained chips from Qualcomm, the US company, according to the people with knowledge of the company’s operations.
Huawei spent about $11bn last year in buying components and services from US companies.
The company’s heavy usage of US cyber security tools, including scanning tools Nmap and Nessus, reflects American dominance in the field.
One of the people with knowledge of the company’s operations said the contracts were usually signed annually, meaning many would run beyond Mr Trump’s three-month reprieve.
A factory tour in Dongguan revealed that some US companies also provide the equipment that Huawei uses to make its latest P30 smartphone.
Machines bearing the logos of Dell and Camalot Prodigy, equipment produced by an Illinois-based company, were seen on the 130-metre production line.
Executives said the company has built up stockpiles of key US components while preparing to find alternatives before the ban comes into effect.
This includes almost six months of smartphone inventory and nine to 12 months of 5G base station inventory, according to estimates from CLSA.
Song Liuping, Huawei’s chief legal officer, warned that the ban would hit what he claimed was the Chinese group’s 3bn customers and said other companies could be similarly targeted.
“When such things happen, the consequences would disrupt supplies and related services to customers,” he said.
“Today, it’s telecoms and Huawei. Tomorrow it could be your industry, your company, your consumers.”
Washington’s actions are already affecting non-US companies.
Several, including Japan’s Panasonic, have said they will stop shipping some components amid fears they could be caught up in the ban given their own use of US technology.
Huawei also faces losing its place in industry standards bodies. JEDEC, which sets guidelines for semiconductors, said Huawei suspended its membership and the SD Association and Wi-Fi Alliance restricted Huawei from their industry bodies late last week. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has also stopped using Huawei employees for the peer-review process of its journals.
Separately, on Wednesday, Japanese mobile carrier SoftBank named Nokia and Ericsson as flagship equipment providers for its 5G deployment, in a fresh blow to Huawei.
Nevertheless, the Chinese company is confident it can cope with the disruption.
“We are looking into all possible measures to solve this issue,” said Catherine Chen, a board director.
“But I don’t know if a single company is capable of doing that. And it seems the US government has little intention to solve this issue. They want only to take us down.”
Mr Dang said Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder and chief executive, had long expected a conflict with the US as the Chinese company became more competitive.
“He always argued that our business should be ready to prepare a plan B,” said Mr Dang.
The executives said some parts of the business, such as the rollout of 5G telecoms services, have yet to see an impact.
Bob Cai, chief marketing officer for the carrier business group, said 42 commercial contracts for 5G have been signed and 100,000 base stations shipped, up from 30,000 at the start of the year.
“Every week we are updating shipment volumes for 5G,” he said.

The US Treasury decided on Tuesday against labelling China a currency manipulator but kept it on its economic watchlist, as it broadened the range of nations it is reviewing for signs of unfair economic practices.
In its twice-yearly report on foreign exchange practices, the Treasury declared it has “significant” concerns about China’s currency practices, but once again stopped short of designating it a manipulator in a move that avoided further escalation of the two countries’ trade conflict.
The department announced an overhaul of the criteria it uses to decide which countries’ economic and currency practices should be subject to special scrutiny for possible currency manipulation.
Some 21 countries were examined in the report, up from 12 previously.
A total of nine nations are now on Treasury’s so-called monitoring list.
Italy, Ireland, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam were added to the list, joining existing members China, Germany, Japan, and South Korea.
The changes come on top of a  proposal last week from the commerce department of a new rule that would allow the government to slap penalties on countries that “act to undervalue their currency relative to the dollar, resulting in a subsidy to their exports”.
The broadened scope of the Treasury’s regular foreign exchange report to Congress reflects the Trump administration’s more aggressive trade and currency policies, as it seeks to crack down on what it sees as unfair currency policies and reduce the US trade deficit. The US had a record goods deficit of $891.3bn in 2018 despite President Donald Trump’s vows to tackle the trade gap.
Under the changes to the Treasury report, the US will now examine all trading partners whose bilateral goods trade with America exceeds $40bn annually, instead of looking only at its 12 largest trading partners.
The 21 countries under the microscope in the latest report amount to $3.5tn of goods trade, or over 80 per cent of all US goods trade in 2018.
The Treasury also adjusted the thresholds it uses to decide whether countries’ economic and foreign exchange practices should be subject to the extra scrutiny of its monitoring list.
The Treasury’s decision not to label China as a currency manipulator will avoid a further worsening of tensions between the two countries following the US decision to boost tariffs on $200bn of imports to 25 per cent.
Mr Trump vowed repeatedly during the election to brand China a currency manipulator, but to date his Treasury department has declined to do so.
The department said it would “continue its enhanced bilateral engagement with China regarding exchange rate issues”.
This is partly because the Chinese currency has fallen against the dollar by 8 per cent over the past year, alongside what Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary, described as an “extremely large and widening bilateral trade surplus”.

Malaysia will return 3,000 tonnes of plastic waste to countries including the US, Canada and Saudi Arabia, amid a broadening clampdown on imports of improperly labelled rubbish across south-east Asia.
Yeo Bee Yin, environment minister, said the country would return the shipments of contaminated plastic rubbish — non-recyclable or low quality plastic — to avoid the “dumping” of waste in Malaysia from the rest of the world.
“Garbage is traded under the pretext of recycling,” she said. “Malaysians are forced to suffer poor air quality due to open burning of plastics which leads to health hazard, polluted rivers, illegal landfills and a host of other related problems.”
South-east Asian countries vastly increased their share of plastic waste management after China, which had been the centre of the global recycling trade, abruptly halted imports of recycled materials at the end of 2017.
But Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia have reportedly been deluged with so much waste that their recycling systems have been overwhelmed.
Rubbish has often been dumped or discarded, only to end up as marine litter.
Ms Yeo told the Financial Times in February that China’s ban “opened our eyes to the problem” that existed but nobody was aware of in Malaysia.
“The entire world just could not cope with the plastic waste that is generated and of course Malaysia is one of the victims in terms of influx.”
Ms Yeo argued that establishing a standardised labelling system that differentiates between high and low quality plastic scraps is essential.
“This is not only our problem, it is all around the world,” she said.
“If they don’t come to south-east Asia they will go to Africa, everywhere”.
Ms Yeo added that an international treaty on plastics was required.
Malaysia’s environment ministry on Tuesday referred to one unnamed UK recycling company that “exported more than 50,000 metric tonnes of plastic waste in about 1,000 containers for the past two years”.
It urged developed countries to investigate their “management of plastic waste” and “stop shipping the garbage out to the developing countries”.
Kuala Lumpur banned imports of contaminated plastic waste in October 2018, and returned five containers of waste to Spain last month.
The environment ministry said an inspection process of containers was taking place to weed out material that was wrongly classified as recyclable.
Malaysia’s move comes as the Philippines is embroiled in a fierce diplomatic dispute with Canada over waste shipments between 2013 and 2014 that were falsely labelled as recyclable material.
Canada missed a May 15 deadline to retrieve the rubbish and Manila recalled its ambassador to Ottawa.
President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to ship the waste back into Canadian territorial waters, while Ottawa has insisted it will complete the transfer by the end of June.
Abishek Balasubramanian at GA Circular, a Singapore-based sustainability consultancy, called it a “blessing in disguise” for the waste-producing countries.
“In the long run such local ecosystems — with collection and recycling within the same country — are typically more resilient than those that depend on international trade,” he said.
The recent upswing in restrictions on waste comes amid rising concern over the environmental impact of plastic, which now pervades oceans and waterways. A recent study published in Nature, the science journal, found millions of pieces of debris on the remote Cocos （Keeling） Islands, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean. Some reports estimate that the world’s oceans are littered with 5.25tn of plastic items.
Governments in south-east Asia have also been emboldened by a deal earlier this month that incorporated mixed and contaminated plastic waste in the Basel convention, a UN-backed treaty that regulates the movement of hazardous waste. The change was supported by 187 countries, with the notable exception of the US, and means that such exports will require prior consent from the governments of the destination countries.

A Chinese pharmaceutical company that overstated its cash balance by Rmb30bn （$4.4bn） said on Wednesday that it did so by using false documents — an admission that sent it shares down 5 per cent.
Guangzhou-based Kangmei Pharmaceutical became embroiled in one of China’s biggest accounting scandals in recent memory when it in April disclosed several huge errors in its 2017 annual report, which resulted in it revising down its operating revenue for that year by Rmb8.9bn.
The incident attracted global attention because the company is included in MSCI’s Emerging Markets index, which is tracked by about $1.9tn in funds.
The scandal has underscored concerns that global investors could face greater-than-anticipated risk when allocating investment to China via the MSCI index.
Kangmei said in a filing on Wednesday that the $4.4bn overstatement was connected to false documentation and transaction records, and noted that “major shortcomings existed in [its] internal controls”.
The company has been under investigation in China for several months and the securities regulator has already accused it of wrongdoing.
In April Kangmei blamed an accounting error for the cash balances overstatement.
Wednesday’s filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange was the first official disclosure from the company that false transaction records were connected to its misreporting.
Kangmei shares fell by their daily allowed maximum of 5 per cent on Wednesday.
The stock has lost more than 60 per cent of its market value since late April when the accounting irregularities were revealed.
Despite the steep decline, trading in the company’s shares has not been frozen by Chinese regulators.
Prior to MSCI’S maiden inclusion last year of several hundred Chinese shares in its index, long freezes on trading in troubled companies — trapping shareholders — was a top complaint of global investors in China’s stock market.
By the end of this year MSCI’s China weighting will rise to 3.3 per cent of the EMs index, up from less than 1 per cent at the start of the year.
The reshuffle of the benchmark is expected to result in an inflow of more than $100bn as investors are obliged to allocate more to China.
Kangmei is not the only Chinese company tracked by the indices to run into trouble.
In March, Hong Kong’s securities regulator froze the shares of China Ding Yi Feng after they rocketed more than 5,000 per cent— a rally that earned them inclusion in MSCI’s EMs index in 2018. The Shenzhen-based company, in which BlackRock holds 2.29 per cent, according to the latest listing of shareholders from Bloomberg, was later accused by the regulator of market manipulation.

China’s crude imports from Iran jumped by a fifth last month before the US removed sanction waivers on oil purchases from the Middle Eastern country.
Data from China’s General Administration show the country imported 3.24m tonnes of crude from Iran in April, a year-on-year rise of 21 per cent. The figure soared 46 per cent in April from March, FT calculations show.
The surge in imports came before the US ended sanctions waivers on Iranian oil for nations including China in April.
China is among the biggest buyers of Iranian oil.
It remains to be seen whether the country will comply with US demands to no longer import crude from the country amid increasing trade tensions between the world’s two leading economies.
The Chinese oil market is dominated by state-owned enterprises and the government voiced  strong opposition  when the US announced plans to stop renewing all waivers in May
Li Li, director of research at ICIS, a petrochemical consulting firm, expects China to continue importing Iranian crude even after the US decision.
“As long as you have shown a big drop in volume purchasing, it would be fine.” Ms Li said.

The phrase “more red flags than a May Day parade” now refers to political perils as well as accounting risks.
The US is attacking businesses linked to the Chinese state, such as Huawei.
Online giants like ecommerce group Alibaba could be next.
Flying the colours of both nations, via a Chinese base and a US listing, would become fraught.
Alibaba’s logical response is to consider a secondary listing in Hong Kong.
Here, founder Jack Ma’s membership of the communist party is seen mainly as a better way to network than joining a smart golf club.
These can be repressive too, remember.
Ask anyone who has tried to tee off in jeans and a T-shirt.
Much has changed since the ebullient Mr Ma led the largest fundraising ever on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. China keeps business on a tight rein. The US has opted for reductive antagonism in trade relations. Just as important, the Hong Kong Exchange permits share classes with extra voting rights. Alibaba floated on the NYSE when these were barred in Hong Kong.
A Fragrant Harbour listing could support the shares — demand for tech stocks is brisk there. Over the past year, Alibaba’s forward earnings multiple has dropped from 30 times. At 23 times, Alibaba shares approach New York’s lowly average valuation of 17 times. In the US, China stocks are often shorted in a bet on worsening trade relations.
Alibaba’s revenues from ecommerce jumped two-fifths to $48bn last year.
Big increases will become harder to achieve if the trade war worsens.
To lift the valuation, a bigger chunk of stock would need to head east than the $20bn rumoured for sale.
That represents only 5 per cent of the worth of Alibaba, which is 38 per cent owned by US and Canadian funds.
But $20bn would be a hefty sum to raise on a bourse one-sixth the size of the NYSE.
Alibaba hardly needs the money.
The business has net cash of some $10bn at the end of March.
During the last financial year, free cash flow was around $17bn.
A Hong Kong listing would reduce the pain of delisting in New York, if that is ever necessary.
The prospect is a melancholy one.
Not only would there be two internets, where you could expect to be surveilled either by Mark Zuckerberg or Xi Jinping.
Ownership would become Balkanised too.
Trade in flags would remain brisk.
More so than for other commodities.

Japan and Europe are not used to thinking of themselves as collateral damage in other countries’ trade wars.
The EU in particular, the largest trading bloc by the amount of exports and imports for goods and services, is more used to dictating terms than to obeying them.
So it is something of a comedown for Tokyo and Brussels to find their main role in the continuing US-China trade conflict is to try to duck out of the way and attempt to channel the torrents of American anger at Beijing down the canals of multilateralism.
Last week in Paris, the EU and Japan met with the US as part of a trilateral initiative first launched in 2017 when Donald Trump was ramping up trade tensions with China.
Their aim is to persuade the US to create alliances rather than fight all-comers.
They are offering Mr Trump a coalition to push for reform of China’s trade-distorting economic model rather than hammering away alone with punishing tariffs on Chinese exports or disruptive bans on doing business with Huawei.
The EU and Japan have plenty at stake.
Both have been hit directly by tariffs on their own steel and aluminium exports to the US, a measure Mr Trump threatens to extend to cars.
European automakers with US plants exporting to China, and Japanese electronics companies which rely on Chinese companies to assemble their products for sales to the US, have also suffered in the Washington-Beijing crossfire.
The three have important interests in common.
Tokyo and Brussels agree with Mr Trump that China has far too much leeway to funnel state subsidies or otherwise distort markets to help its companies.
Their proposal is for the three authorities to come up with a new and broader definition of illegitimate payments.
Once achieved, they would then work to persuade other big countries including China to join a collective binding pledge at the World Trade Organization not to use such handouts in future.
But the Trump administration has an instinctive aversion to anything leading toward multilateralism.
People familiar with last week’s discussions in Paris said that, while the US has engaged with the process, a strong common position remains elusive.
The meeting finally produced only a thin statement of intent.
“The statement had multiple mentions of common concerns, but not much agreement over what to do about them,” Lourdes Catrain, a partner in the trade practice at the law firm Hogan Lovells in Brussels, says.
US officials put forward only a very broad definition of subsidies, for instance, one that observers criticise as being unrealistic.
On the EU side, there are fears this definition could end up outlawing some government payments permitted by EU state aid rules - and ironically even state and federal support in the US.
Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, and Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU trade commissioner, clashed over the US’s use of emergency tariffs based on concerns about national security.
And the EU and US continued to disagree about how to resolve a subsidy dispute of their own, the legal battle over handouts to Airbus and Boeing, which has now been running for nearly 15 years.
The US has recently shown signs of concentrating its fire and picking its enemies.
Mr Trump elected to lift steel and aluminium tariffs on Mexico and Canada to get “Nafta 2.0” — the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement （USMCA） — through Congress.
An optimistic reading is that he is grasping the importance of the US distinguishing between an economic rival like China and like-minded countries such as its North American neighbours.
But Simon Lester of the Cato Institute think-tank in Washington DC says: “I think dropping the tariffs on Canada and Mexico was a transactional move to get the new NAFTA through Congress rather than a broader recognition that China should now be the focus.”
At the same time, the White House gave the EU and Japan a six-month reprieve on imposing auto tariffs.
Tokyo and Brussels will seize on any sign of co-operation to argue that the US is better off regarding them as allies in a campaign for a bigger prize — reform of world trade rules to constrain China — than as rivals.
So far, however, that crusade shows limited signs of progress.

Huawei on Wednesday signalled that it was pressing ahead with its lawsuit against the US government over a federal ban on equipment purchases, saying it had asked a US court for a summary judgement in an attempt to speed up the case’s resolution.
The embattled Chinese company confirmed in March that it was  suing the US government over its “unconstitutional” ban on  federal agencies buying Huawei technology, accusing the US Congress of acting as “judge, jury and executioner”.
Its latest request for a summary judgement means that Huawei is requesting the Eastern District of Texas court to rule on the matter without a full trial.
“Politicians in the US are using the strength of an entire nation to come after a private company,” said Song Liuping, chief legal officer at Huawei. He added that the company “has confidence in the independence and integrity of the US judicial system”, and expressed hopes that the “mistakes in the National Defence Authorisation Act can be corrected by the court”.
The case relates to the restrictions placed on Huawei last year as part of the annual US NDAA.
That act was separate from a more recent move in May by US President Donald Trump to place the Chinese telco on a “banned entity list”, which forbids US companies from supplying it with technology unless they obtain a special licence from the commerce department.
US action against Huawei has come against the backdrop of escalating Sino-US tensions on trade and technology. The move by Mr Trump to commercially isolate Huawei has garnered fierce opposition from the Chinese government, which  lashed out against the blacklisting at a WTO meeting in Geneva on Tuesday.

Serbia put its army on alert on Tuesday after armed police in neighbouring Kosovo raided properties in the Serb-dominated north of the country in an anti-smuggling operation.
More than two dozen people, including ethnic Serb and Albanian members of the Kosovo police were arrested as well as two UN officials — including a Russian national — who were accused of using a diplomatic vehicle as a barricade.
Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic said he had ordered soldiers near the Kosovo border to be on “combat alert”, in case tensions escalated.
Speaking in a parliamentary debate on Monday about Kosovo, which is 90 per cent ethnic Albanian, Mr Vucic said it was “only a matter of time until the Albanians attack the Serbs in Kosovo”.
As tensions between the Balkan neighbours flared, Pristina called on Belgrade not to politicise a police operation aimed at customs evasion.
“Organised crime and smuggling are a direct threat to our mutual progress, and should NOT be supported on ethnic nor any other basis. The government of Serbia should not undermine our efforts to tackle it,” Kosovo’s prime minister Ramush Haradinaj wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.
The country’s foreign minister Behgjet Pacolli told the Financial Times that after an investigation lasting several months, the operation had targeted a network “deeply involved in smuggling, bribery, abuse of public office and other organised crime activities”.
Kosovo’s president Hashim Thaci accused the Russian UN employee of being “camouflaged under a diplomatic veil to hamper the police operation”.
Belgrade’s reaction to the raid in the city of Mitrovica, which is divided between Serbs and Albanians, highlights the still fraught relationship between Serbia and its former province. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost 10 years after the end of a bloody armed conflict.
More than 100 countries recognise Kosovo, but crucially Russia, China and Serbia do not.
Kosovo did not exercise police control over its restive north until after 2013, when Pristina and Belgrade signed an EU-brokered agreement.
According to the terms, hundreds of ethnic Serbs who served in Serbia’s police force would be retrained and hired by the Kosovo police.
Belgrade-backed institutions, unrecognised by Pristina, still function in Kosovo’s north.
Brussels has been mediating negotiations between Mr Vucic and Kosovan president, Hashim Thaci in an attempt to reach a “legally binding agreement” to normalise relations, but they have stalled in recent months.
Russia called Tuesday’s police raids and the arrest of its UN diplomat a “provocation”.
The diplomat was later released.
Several thousand Nato peacekeepers are stationed in Kosovo.
Since 2008 the country has hosted EULEX, the largest civilian defence mission ever deployed under the EU’s common defence and security policy, which for years oversaw Kosovo’s police and judicial operations.
“The police operation in Mitrovica targeting individual suspects from across the whole region and the rest of Kosovo, following court orders, should be conducted in accordance with law and properly communicated,” EU spokesperson Maja Kocijancic told the FT.
“Such operations need to reinforce and not weaken the normalisation efforts,” she said, calling for restraint.

Escalating global trade wars chilled international commerce in the first quarter of the year, according to new figures from the OECD, with US imports from China experiencing their largest fall on record.
Among G20 economies imports were down 1.2 per cent between January and March compared with the previous quarter while exports were marginally higher by 0.4 per cent, the Paris-based international organisation reported on Tuesday.
As tensions increase ahead of China’s latest tit-for-tat tariff increase— $60bn of US goods will face levies from June 1 — indicators of global trade show companies are hunkering down.
Since the first round of the US-China trade war started in the third quarter of 2018, G20 imports, measured in US dollars, have dropped 2.7 per cent and exports 0.8 per cent, the OECD said.
US imports from China plunged 12 per cent over the same period, the steepest fall on record, while overall US imports were down only 1.9 per cent.
Chinese exports rose 3.9 per cent, demonstrating that the main effect of US tariffs was to distort trading patterns at the same time as cooling global business activity and lowering growth rates.
Laurence Boone, chief economist at the OECD, said last week that “trade tensions are not only hurting the short-term outlook but also medium-term prospects”.
She predicted that the threatened further escalation of 25 per cent tariffs on all US-China trade would cut 0.6 per cent from US output by 2021, with China losing 0.8 per cent.
Donald Trump has vowed to increase tariffs to 25 per cent on a further $300bn of Chinese goods, perhaps as soon as late June, having already imposed such levies on $200bn of Chinese imports earlier this month.
The OECD figures chimed with the latest report from the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis that estimated the global volume of trade declined 0.3 per cent in the first quarter.
Trade shrank on an annual basis in December for the first time since late 2016 and was down 2.7 per cent in March compared with the same month a year earlier.
The latest data contained many signs that US-China trade tensions were hitting other Asian countries, which rely heavily on their role in Chinese companies’ supply chains.
Indonesia’s exports were down 4.3 per cent in the first quarter, with Japan’s exports dropping 2.3 per cent and South Korea’s 7.1 per cent lower.
The main exception to the first-quarter slowdown was the UK, which recorded 6.2 per cent export growth and 5 per cent import growth according to the OECD — but these sharp increases were due to companies preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit.
The UK’s performance reflected “firms stockpiling and increasing international trade activity due to Brexit uncertainty”, the OECD said.

China’s financial regulators are stepping up penalties on banks and asset managers caught hiding bad debts as Beijing grows increasingly wary of the country’s opaque cache of unpaid loans.
The strengthened enforcement underlines authorities’ rising concerns over a potential runaway bad debt problem at smaller banks in the country, a trend that China’s top leaders fear could spawn financial and social instability.
Fines for banks and asset managers that help mask the bad debt are on the rise, with at least five large institutions, including a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, receiving penalties over the past month. While the amounts are relatively small, the penalties are intended to deter other institutions from doing the same, analysts said.
Last year, disposals of bad debt were already running at a two-decade high as regulators forced banks to fully recognise their positions.
Non-performing loan rates have hit more than 40 per cent at some small banks, signalling further undiscovered bad debt.
Such statistics are a hurdle to maintaining financial markets stability — a top priority for the country’s leaders.
For years, smaller Chinese banks routinely masked their NPLs by classifying them as “special mention loans” — loans that were late but not yet considered non-performing.
As a result of that practice, banks typically reported upwards of 20 per cent special mention loans but low rates of NPLs.
In 2018, regulators forced banks to recognise the bad debt disguised as special mention loans, resulting in Rmb1.75tn （$258bn） hitting the market for bad debt sales last year, the highest level in 20 years.
“The aim of such tight policy is to expose the problems at the banks to the regulators, because banks have been able to use various means to hide non-performing assets,” said Wang Ke, a vice-president at Shanghai-based conglomerate Win Group, and an expert on China’s provincial asset management groups.
Regulators are now shifting their focus to how local asset managers help disguise bad debt.
Asset managers controlled by local governments have been tasked with resolving some of the country’s massive bad debt load, but they also sometimes work against regulators’ efforts to expose the true size of the problem.
In some situations, banks have been caught injecting liquidity into asset managers, with the funds used to buy up the banks’ bad debt and temporarily remove it from the balance sheet, according to people familiar with the practice.
The arrangement often includes an agreement for the asset manager to later sell the toxic asset back to the bank at a profit.
The banking regulator in April issued fines for such activities to ICBC, China Minsheng Bank, Tianjin Rural Commercial Bank and Shengjing Bank, a move that coincided with a warning from the National Audit Office over the risks of covering up bad debt.
However, the crackdown is forcing more bad debt on to the market than investors have capacity to buy, noted Wang Yingyi, a partner at Bald Eagle Asset Management.
“In the long term, it is certainly a good thing to run with the rules, but in the short term it will have great impact on the [non-performing loan sales] industry,” he said.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to a 20-month low on Tuesday as escalating trade tensions between the US and China and elevated concerns over a slowing global economy continued to drive interest in safe government bonds.
The yield on the 10-year note, which moves inversely to price, fell as much as 6 basis points to 2.26 per cent, the lowest level since September 26 2017.
The yield on the 30-year dropped 5bp to 2.70 per cent, a 17-month low.
The two-year yield moved 4bp lower to 2.12 per cent.
“The trade issue with China is having a pronounced effect on global growth and the market thinks the Fed needs to cut rates from here,” said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global.
“The economy is slowing and I don’t think this trade issue is going away anytime soon.”
Treasury prices have been rallying all through the month of May amid growing fears the deadlock in trade talks and the escalating tit-for-tat tariff battle will throw a spanner into US and Chinese economic growth.
The latest leg lower in bond yields come after President Donald Trump warned on Monday that US tariffs on goods from China could still easily go up substantially from current elevated levels.
Wrapping up a state visit to Japan, Mr Trump said: “As far as China is concerned, they want to make a deal. I think they probably wish they made the deal that they had on the table before they tried to renegotiate it . . . We’re not ready to make a deal. We’re taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs, and that number could go up very, very substantially, very easily.”
The heated rhetoric has kept equities under pressure, although by lunchtime trading in New York the benchmark S&P 500 was marginally higher.
Growth concerns were most readily reflected in the Treasury market.
The 10-year bond yield has fallen by nearly 23bp since the start of the month, putting it on track for its biggest monthly drop since March.
Recent US economic data has been mixed.
On Tuesday, The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index, a gauge of Americans’ willingness to spend, rose 4.9 points to 134.1 in May, beating market forecasts to reach its highest level since November.
Last week, measures of durable goods orders and manufacturing activity were disappointing.
Morgan Stanley’s US equity strategists, led by Michael Wilson, said on Tuesday that weak economic data alone is causing concern and suggests growth will trend lower even if there is a resolution to the trade war.
“Recent data points suggest US earnings and economic risk is greater than most investors think,” they wrote in a note to clients.
“Get ready for more potential growth disappointments even with a trade deal.”

Investors have increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut US interest rates not once but twice this year, to counter concerns about slowing global economic growth that have been inflamed by the worsening US-China trade war.
The probability that the central bank will cut rates two or more times by the end of 2019 rose above 40 per cent on Tuesday, according to futures prices, exceeding for the first time expectations of a single cut.
The markets have been signalling a single rate cut this year for several months, even while the Fed has been keeping official policy on pause and maintained that its next move could be in either direction.
Concerns over the growth outlook have been roiling the bond market, helping push the US government’s borrowing costs lower as investors sought out the relative safety of Treasuries.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, fell as much as 6 basis points on Tuesday to 2.26 per cent, marking its lowest level since September 2017.
“The economic data continues to weaken, exacerbated by a prolonged trade war with China,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “That second rate cut is gaining traction because the market believes the economy will weaken.”
The US slapped additional tariffs on imports from China this month, and Chinese officials retaliated with measures of their own.
President Donald Trump warned on Monday that US tariffs on goods from China could still “go up very, very substantially, very easily”.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has proposed a €32.6bn all-share merger with Renault, a deal that would reshape the global automotive industry and inject fresh life into the French carmaker’s alliance with Japan’s Nissan.
The proposal for a “transformative merger” would see FCA and Renault each own 50 per cent of the business, which would have combined sales of 8.7m vehicles a year — larger than General Motors and third globally behind Volkswagen and Toyota.
The combined group would have nearly €170bn in annual revenue on operating profit of more than €10bn, and net profit exceeding €8bn, FCA said.
It would have a large presence in North America as well as Europe and Latin America, and expertise stretching from small electric vehicles to pick-up trucks.
The proposed tie-up comes despite the departure over the past year of the dominant executives at the two companies who long advocated consolidation: FCA’s Sergio Marchionne and  Renault’s Carlos Ghosn. Marchionne died in July, while Mr Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in November on charges of financial misconduct. Mr Ghosn has maintained his innocence.
A combination would also bring together Italy’s Agnelli family, which owns 29 per cent of FCA, and the French government, which owns 15 per cent of Renault, as the dominant shareholders in the merged company.
Both have commanded voting rights beyond their respective shareholdings, but that would fall away through the deal.
Their respective shareholdings would also be halved in the new entity.
The top leadership positions were not disclosed in Monday’s proposal.
However, John Elkann, who steers Exor, the Agnelli family investment vehicle, is expected to become chairman of the merged group, while Renault chair Jean-Dominique Senard would be named chief executive, multiple people close to the talks said.
Englishman Mike Manley, chief executive of FCA, is expected to be named chief operating officer.
A board of 11 representatives would include four representatives each from FCA and Renault and one nominee from Nissan.
Shares in Renault, which began Monday with a market value of almost €15bn, surged 13.8 per cent in early Paris trading.
FCA, which started the day worth less than €18bn, climbed 10.6 per cent.
Because of the differences in market value at the start of the day, FCA shareholders would receive a dividend of €2.5bn before the deal closes.
The value of the transaction will fluctuate with the share prices.
Although not included in the proposal, the deal would also involve Renault shelving plans to merge with alliance partner Nissan in the short term, according to people briefed on the discussions.
Nissan holds a 15 per cent stake in the French group with no voting rights.
Delaying  Nissan merger plans will cool tensions between the French and Japanese partners that were exacerbated after the arrest of Mr Ghosn.
The proposal will also see the French state, which has often been a source of distrust in the alliance, lose its position as the largest shareholder in the group to Exor.
It could also, say people familiar with the matter, see the state have no board seat at the newly created company, but that has yet to be decided, stress others close to the government.
The potential for Nissan to gain voting rights in a newly created Dutch entity — its shares in Renault were not votable under French governance rules — is another inducement, according to people familiar with the deal. However, it remains uncertain whether that will help win Nissan over to the tie-up.
Renault’s board, which met on Monday morning, said it would “study with interest the opportunity of such a business combination”, calling it a “friendly proposal”.
It aims to make an initial decision as soon as possible, potentially by next week, according to people briefed on the matter.
The combined entity could see savings “in excess of €5bn . . . incremental to existing Alliance synergies”, according to a statement from FCA.
FCA estimates €1bn in annual synergies for Renault’s alliance partners Nissan and Mitsubishi from the combination.
Those would not come through plant closures but “through more capital efficient investment in common global vehicle platforms, architectures, powertrains and technologies”.
Mr Elkann, chairman of FCA, said on Monday that Italy would “reap the benefits if this deal goes ahead”.
He added that Fiat Chrysler had “acted with courage” in the past decade, and was ready to do so again.
The French government, which was informed of the specific proposal on Friday, said it was “in favour” of a deal so long as it was “at the same time favourable to the economic development of Renault and obviously to the employees of Renault”.
The deal would be implemented through a Dutch-based holding company plan Renault had earlier proposed for its full merger with Nissan, which the Japanese group has repeatedly resisted.
Goldman Sachs, d’Angelin & Co and Nomura were financial advisers to FCA, while Sullivan & Cromwell and Darrois Villey Maillot Brochier provided legal advice.
Financial advisers to Renault were Ardea Partners and Société Générale, and legal advice was provided by Skadden Arps.

Aiways, a privately owned Shanghai-based carmaker, plans to begin offering its all-electric sports utility vehicle in Europe early next year — in what would be the first Chinese-brand electric car offering on the continent.
Aiways aims to begin leasing its electric sport utility vehicle in April 2020 in the EU, Switzerland and Norway as it seeks to disrupt a market dominated by combustion engine cars produced by German, French, US, Japanese and Korean manufacturers.
The privately owned start-up, valued at $1.6bn, hopes to make its U5 SUV price competitive by doing away with dealerships and offering the vehicle only via online leasing.
Alexander Klose, executive vice-president for overseas operations and former chief executive of Volvo Cars China, said: “If you’d go ahead in a traditional way, you’d have to build up dealerships and be saddled with costs.
“You’d probably end up with the same costs as the Europeans. We aren’t doing that. It would be too difficult to compete with the internal combustion engine.”
Mr Klose said Aiways has not yet determined what it will charge monthly for its SUV under the leasing plan, although if it were selling the vehicle it would “definitely” cost less than €40,000.
Beijing has long sought to foster car brands that compete globally, but so far the products have not been good enough.
Great Wall, for instance, tried to market its SUVs in Italy but sold only a few hundred a year.
But the quality of Chinese carmakers has improved “massively” over the past decade, said Robin Zhu, a Bernstein analyst.
Some analysts also see electric vehicles as a game-changer for Chinese companies, as they are simpler to build and the supply chain is centred in Asia.
Aiways is in talks with Vehiculum, a German start-up offering online leasing, to market the car without dealerships.
Vehiculum said carmakers can save 15-20 per cent of profit margins by shifting the purchase online, although Aiways will spend on pop-up shops to show off the car and offer test drives.
Lukas Steinhilber, Vehiculum chief executive, said European buyers might be wary of China-based brands they are unfamiliar with but he said subscriptions could change the dynamic because customers will not have to make a big purchase or worry over resale values several years later.
“Many millennials wouldn’t consider paying €30,000 to €40,000 for a car,” he said.
“They are growing up with Uber and car sharing. But then they have kids and they find they do need a car. They say, ‘I have €400 for the month and want to know what’s available’.”
However, Mr Zhu sees little evidence that Chinese carmakers have a cost advantage, adding that doing away with dealerships was unlikely to prove advantageous.
“EVs are expected to be more expensive than gasoline cars for several years more at least, but mainly due to variable cost reasons rather than the distribution model,” he said.
Lynk & Co, an arm of Chinese carmaker Geely, also plans to hit the European market in the middle of next year with subscription-only services for its combustion engine and hybrid cars.
It has been likened to the “ Netflix of cars”, with subscriptions as short as one month.
Mr Klose said leasing options under 12 months will not be feasible for Aiways, but its packages will be all-inclusive with insurance.
The experience of some bigger Chinese companies suggests Aiways’ plan to enter western markets is fraught with difficulties.
Shanghai-based, US-listed Nio, for instance, originally said it would launch vehicles in the US by 2020 but has suspended the plan to focus on the Chinese market, according to William Li, its chief executive.
“Entering a market is one thing but serving it is another,” said Mr Li.
“You need a service network. We want to make sure we have [annual] volume in the thousands before we enter a market.”

China has lashed out at the US over its blacklisting of Huawei, accusing it of abusing national security exceptions to global trade rules during a tense meeting at the World Trade Organization.
The confrontation in Geneva on Tuesday highlighted the extent to which President Donald Trump’s move to commercially isolate Huawei by placing it on an export blacklist has further inflamed trade tensions between the countries and complicated hopes of a deal to end their trade war.
According to a trade official based in Geneva, China introduced a discussion of the Huawei ban at a meeting of the WTO’s market access committee under “other business” — then proceeded to attack the Trump administration’s move.
The representative from Beijing then accused the US of violating WTO rules by proceeding with the action against Huawei, and said Washington should “immediately lift all unilateral sanction measures against Chinese companies”.
China widened its argument to say that the US was unfairly claiming national security exceptions across the board, saying it had caused “great concern in the membership” of the WTO.
Since Mr Trump took office, the US has invoked national security concerns to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to do the same with automotive levies.
During the confrontation, the Chinese official went as far as citing a quote from the US delegation negotiating postwar trading rules in 1947 — warning that there was “great danger of having too wide an exception that would permit anything under the sun”.
The US trade representative’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A trade official in Geneva said at the meeting that the US declined to mount a strong defence since the item was not on the ordinary agenda and instead simply directed officials to look at official US government notices about the Huawei ban.
The US moved ahead with the blacklisting of Huawei this month after the company was charged with stealing trade secrets and violating US sanctions.
National security officials from at least three different administrations in Washington have believed for years that the company was a vehicle for Chinese espionage.
The placement of Huawei on the so-called entity list is a major challenge for the company because it means US businesses — including chipmakers and software providers— cannot sell to it without obtaining a licence from the US commerce department.
Last week, before leaving for a trip to Tokyo, Mr Trump appeared to soften his line on Huawei, saying that while it was a “very dangerous” company from a “security standpoint”, it could be “ included” in a trade deal with China.
However, it is far from clear that key members of his administration, including Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, share that view.
China’s complaints about the US violating WTO rules by pressing ahead with export controls on Huawei are likely to fall on deaf ears within the Trump administration, which views the Geneva-based trade body with suspicion.
Officials in Washington have accused the WTO of failing to police China’s violations of WTO rules since its accession in 2001, particularly when it comes to Beijing’s rampant use of industrial subsidies.
The US has also clamoured for reform of the WTO, but so far little progress has been made in negotiating an overhaul with other countries.
While the chances of an agreement to end the trade dispute between the US and China have dwindled, the two countries have not ruled out a meeting between Mr Trump and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, next month.
Mr Trump insisted that the US was “not ready” for a deal yet with China, but one could still come in the future.

A leading professional association critical for international research collaborations and setting global industry standards in technologies such as artificial intelligence has banned Huawei reviewers from its journals, sparking outrage from Chinese researchers.
The New Jersey-headquarter IEEE, or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, can no longer use Huawei employees for the peer-review process of the association’s journals, according to a screenshot of an email sent to IEEE journal editors-in-chief and confirmed with Chinese IEEE researchers.
The decision was made to conform with President Donald Trump’s move to place Huawei on an export blacklist, the email said, adding that the body had “no choice but to comply” because of unspecified “severe legal implications”.
Being shut out of the IEEE would be a blow for Huawei’s plans to become a global leader in providing 5G and developing “smart cities” technologies, which use big data and artificial intelligence in urban services ranging from traffic to waste management.
In January, the company hosted an IEEE meeting in southern China’s Shenzhen with the goal of using Huawei projects as the global industry gold standard for smart city technologies.
Chinese researchers have also expressed fears that the ban of Huawei reviewers could later be expanded to a ban on submissions to IEEE publications by Huawei-funded or led research.
News of the IEEE’s decision became a top 10 trending topic on China’s largest social media platform, Weibo, with a number of Chinese researchers voicing outrage.
In response to the decision, Zhang Haixia, a nanotechnology researcher at China’s prestigious Peking University, resigned from her positions on the editorial boards of two IEEE publications.
Replacing Huawei reviewers was a “professional integrity” violation, Zhang wrote in an open letter to the IEEE president published on her personal blog, adding that the association was meant to be a “international society”, rather than a US organisation.
The IEEE said the move was to comply “with US government regulations which restrict the ability of the listed Huawei companies and their employees to participate in certain activities that are not generally open to the public. This includes certain aspects of the publication peer review and editorial process”.
However, it added that Huawei employees who are members of the body could still exercise some functions, such as their corporate and individual voting rights, submitting technical papers for publication, presenting at IEEE-sponsored meetings and conferences, and sponsoring and accepting IEEE awards.
They could also continue to play a role in standard setting, attending IEEE standards development meetings, submitting new standards proposals and participating in public discussions of standards technology proposals.
It is unclear from the email why Huawei employees working with the IEEE would be considered a US export to the company.
While US-based, the organisation bills itself as neutral and global.
The current president-elect is Japanese robotics researcher Toshio Fukuda, who is a professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology.
The company has already lost its position in a number of US-based industry standard-setting bodies, including its membership of the JEDEC, which sets guidelines for semiconductors, the SD Association and Wi-Fi Alliance.
As the world’s largest professional technical association, the IEEE brings together researchers from various countries in fields from nano-technology to artificial intelligence to publish papers, attend conferences and set industry standards.
Most major tech companies work with the IEEE on standard-setting and numerous top Chinese researchers sit on its journals review boards.
In recent years, China has played a growing role in the body, churning out research papers and hosting global conferences, as the country forges ahead with a government-backed plan to lead international research and innovation on emerging technologies.
US lawmakers have raised concerns about collaborations between western institutions and Chinese researchers working on artificial intelligence technologies with applications in China’s security state.

Alibaba is planning a secondary listing in Hong Kong, according to people familiar with the matter, one of whom said the Chinese ecommerce company was looking to raise some $20bn.
The company, which in 2014 raised $25bn in the US with the world’s biggest initial public offering, is expected to complete the Hong Kong listing later this year, the people said.
One person familiar with the plans said the move was designed to diversify funding sources.
But it also comes as China and the US face off in an increasingly broad trade war that has pushed Chinese technology companies towards greater self-reliance on domestic supply chains, technology and funding.
Alibaba declined to comment.
The listing would represent a win for the Hong Kong exchange, which lost out to New York in 2014 because its listing rules at the time did not allow for Alibaba’s corporate structure, which gives founding partners, rather than shareholders, control over board appointments.
In 2018, HKEX changed its rules to allow “ innovative companies” from China already listed elsewhere to do a secondary listing in Hong Kong even if their voting rights structures did not comply with local standards.
Charles Li, HKEX chief executive, told the Financial Times last year that the Alibaba listing in New York “gave us a huge opportunity to review our structure and allowed us to make a series of decisions that led us here today” as the exchange prepared the new rules.
Against the backdrop of the US-China trade war, Alibaba’s New York Stock Exchange depositary receipts have fallen more than 20 per cent in the past 12 months but are still up nearly 130 per cent from their listing price five years ago.
“This is a very good opportunity not only for Alibaba, but also to persuade other [Chinese] companies listed in the US — if they don’t want to come back to China at least come back to Hong Kong,” said Daniel Wan, a partner at law firm Addleshaw Goddard in Hong Kong.
A listing in Hong Kong, he added, was preferable for foreign investors while also satisfying Beijing’s desire for its biggest tech companies, which handle vast troves of Chinese user data, to list closer to home.
Alibaba’s plan to seek a secondary listing was first reported by Bloomberg.
The role and potential vulnerability of Chinese tech companies listed abroad has been viewed with increasing unease by Beijing since the start of the trade war.
“With all this trade war talk it seems like it’s spreading to the capital market side,” said on China tech banker. He said it sent “a signal of support to the country” that Alibaba was doing its bit to support the greater Chinese capital markets.
China is in the process of launching a new tech board in Shanghai that it hopes will become the top destination for local tech companies looking to go public.
SMIC, China’s biggest semiconductor maker, said last week that it was withdrawing its New York listing.
Like its peers, Alibaba has looked at various options for listing in China, including an abortive plan for China depositary receipts championed by Beijing.
That idea was scotched by the conflicting desires of the government, which had long sought to woo its national technology champions to domestic exchanges, and companies, which chafe at the less market-oriented practices on the domestic A-share market.

China’s powerful planning body has threatened to use rare earths exports as leverage in the trade war with the US, in a sign of increasing tensions between the two powers.
Rare earths, a group of 17 metals with a variety of high-tech applications, used in magnets, instrument displays and other strategic applications, are the one raw material where China dominates global supply.
A tightening in Chinese export quotas a decade ago brought the little-known minerals to the attention of the international security community as a potential strategic threat.
Relations between China and the US have deteriorated sharply since they failed to sign an anticipated trade deal in early May.
Last week, shortly after Donald Trump, US president, blacklisted the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei, President  Xi Jinping visited a  rare earths magnets firm in Ganzhou, in southeastern Jiangxi province.
The move has been interpreted as the prelude to retaliation.
The National Development and Reform Commission, which oversees economic policy shifts, highlighted in a questions-and-answers bulletin yesterday the threat of an export cut-off.
“Will rare earths become China’s counter-weapon against the US’s unwarranted suppression? What I can tell you is that if anyone wants to use products made from rare earth to curb the development of China, then the people of the revolutionary soviet base and the whole Chinese people will not be happy,” the notice read.
However, the NDRC stopped short of declaring any specific policies.
China currently exports very few rare earths directly to the US.
Intermediate products containing rare earths metals go through a long production chain, mostly in China and Japan.
Washington has identified the exports as a vulnerability and exempted the material from its tarriffs.
Rare earths capture the attention of security strategists but in practice would be difficult to wield as a weapon.
China first imposed export quotas on rare earths more than a decade ago, but dropped the quotas in 2015 after losing a case at the World Trade Organization.
It is not clear how it would regulate trade in intermediate or downstream products.
The problem for China is that any new restrictions would cause damage to its recently developed industrial supply chains, which are dependent on foreign customers in the US, Europe and Japan.
Any restriction would reinforce the notion that China was a risky source of supply.
Three state-owned mining firms have wrestled for control over the rich deposits around Ganzhou, in south-central China.
Companies mining or processing rare earths in Ganzhou recorded RMB26bn in revenue in 2018, according to the NDRC.
Ganzhou stands at the edge of the Jinggangshan range, where the Chinese Communists formed a revolutionary base before retreating on the Long March in 1934-1935.
Mr Xi’s visit to the area last week symbolised self-reliance and determination in the face of the trade war, in the spirit of the Long March.

Cryptocurrencies, the asset class written off by most investors after enormous price falls last year, are back.
Bitcoin, the world’s largest digital asset by market capitalisation, jumped as much as 10 per cent to $8,942.58 on Monday, its highest level in a year, according to Bloomberg data.
That takes its gains this year to about 140 per cent, including a near-70 per cent rise this month.
Among other digital assets, Litecoin’s rise of about 13 per cent on Monday has taken gains this year to more than 290 per cent.
Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up almost 8 per cent on Monday and is up nearly 110 per cent this year.
The gains are reminiscent of some of the huge price rises seen during the cryptocurrency boom of late 2017.
They make bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies some of the biggest beneficiaries of this year’s rally in riskier assets, which has been fuelled by signs of yet more loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank.
The surprise revival comes after a painful 2018 in which bitcoin slumped by almost three-quarters, while many hedge funds investing in cryptocurrencies posted huge losses and some shut up shop.
“A lot of people thought that crypto has gone, that’s it,” said Manuel Ernesto De Luque Muntaner, founder and chief executive of Luxembourg-based Block Asset Management, which invests in blockchain and cryptocurrency funds.
“The crypto winter is gone,” he added, saying that demand from institutional buyers and venture capital funds had helped fuel the rebound in prices this year.
Website 99bitcoins, which collects quotes from commentators predicting the demise of the digital currency, recorded 93 bitcoin “obituaries” last year, and a total of 359 since December 2010.
But this year there are signs of growing interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies among institutional investors and big corporations.
Facebook, for instance, is looking to create a new digital currency, while JPMorgan Chase has unveiled plans to allow corporate clients to transfer “JPM Coins” between accounts over a blockchain.
This year’s rally has taken the total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies to nearly $270bn, according to website Coinmarketcap.com, of which bitcoin accounts for 57 per cent.
“When demand starts to pick up, there is no offsetting rise in supply that can dampen the price rise,” said Caitlin Long, a former Morgan Stanley banker who is now part of the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force. “There isn’t a central bank to expand or contract its balance sheet as the price moves.”
The total number of crypto accounts registered by Blockchain, a wallet provider, has been rising at a fairly steady pace in recent years, including even during last year’s sell-off.
However, growing interest has seen that rise at a slightly faster pace over the past month to more than 38m, according to the company.
Even so, there is still some way to go before cryptocurrencies are back near peak prices.
Bitcoin, for instance, remains 53 per cent down from its record high of almost $20,000 in December 2017.

Those of us who waste time watching YouTube videos are familiar with a classic from the American racetrack, in which two horses called respectively “My wife knows everything” and “The wife doesn’t know” battle it out.
The early interpretations of the European elections reminded me of that video — except in this case the two horses are called “This changes everything” and “This changes nothing”.
Those who argue that “this changes nothing” have some powerful points.
Collectively, pro-EU parties will continue to dominate the European Parliament.
Anti-EU parties now account for about a quarter of the seats in the parliament, up from about 20 per cent.
But some of the stars of the nationalist right had disappointing nights — including the Alternative for Germany, the Danish People’s party and the Forum for Democracy in the Netherlands.
However, those who think that “this changes everything” also have evidence to point to.
Eurosceptic （or Eurohostile） parties emerged as the largest in four of the six most populous EU countries: France, Italy, Britain and Poland.
One reason for this clash of interpretations is an over-focus on just one question: what does this mean for the battle between the pro-EU forces and anti-EU insurgents?
But if you ask a different question — what is happening to the parties that have dominated European politics?
— then a clearer trend emerges.
The traditional centre-left and centre-right are in decline.
They are losing ground not just to populist nationalists, but also to parties that appeal to an urbanised middle-class, such as the greens and liberals.
In France, the centre-right and centre-left （the Republicans and the Socialists） scored less than 15 per cent of the vote, while the far-right, the liberals and the greens scooped up almost 60 per cent.
In Italy, the centre-left and centre-right won about 31 per cent of the vote; populist parties scored 58 per cent.
In Britain, the Conservatives and Labour won just 23.2 per cent of the vote between them.
This trend against the traditional mainstream parties extended even into stable, sensible Germany, where the centre-right Christian Democrats and centre-left Social Democrats fell well below 50 per cent of the vote combined.
The greens came in second with just over 20 per cent, with the far-right claiming another 11 per cent.
It seems that political parties built around the class and economic structures of the 19th and 20th centuries are losing their relevance.
European voters are increasingly motivated by new issues — such as climate change, identity and migration.
The consequence is likely to be a period of political uncertainty and flux that will make it harder for the EU to act.
The fact that the centre-right, socialists, liberals and greens are all broadly pro-EU cannot disguise their very different views on key areas such as climate change and eurozone reform.
One big issue to look out for is the political future of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor.
Another dismal result for the SPD may persuade them to pull out of the governing coalition, so collapsing the government.
Ms Merkel will also be under pressure from within her own CDU.
The party’s weak electoral performance may empower Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the chancellor’s heir apparent, to push for Ms Merkel to go sooner rather than later.
Meanwhile, some in the CDU will argue for a move sharply to the right on issues such as the euro and energy policy.
If Ms Merkel is forced out early, the EU will have lost its dominant political figure.
But even if she stays in office for another two years, the fragmentation of European politics, reflected in the European Council and the parliament, may hinder the EU reaching decisions on crucial matters, including the euro, migration, Brexit and policy on China.
An early test will come with the discussion over the new leaders for the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Council.
In theory, this should be wrapped up quite quickly, with the first serious discussion taking place this week.
But the confused picture emerging from the elections may lead to a protracted process that glues up the institutions.
Some issues cannot be deferred forever.
By October, Britain and the EU will once again have to consider whether to extend the Brexit process, or to accept a “no deal” Brexit.
The odds of “no deal” have surely risen after the polls.
French president Emmanuel Macron’s ambitious plans for eurozone reform look even less likely to make progress, given his own relatively weak performance and the current political confusion in Germany.
However, events in the markets — in particular, renewed pressure on the euro — could force the EU’s hand.
The big question underlying all this is whether the EU is gradually disintegrating, or gradually progressing towards a closer union that can defend Europe’s interests.
That matters increasingly in a world that would otherwise be dominated by two potentially hostile superpowers — the US and China, with Russia also playing a malevolent role.
The beginnings of a global trade war ensure that this is not an abstract question for the EU.
On the contrary, European unity will be tested repeatedly by world events in the coming months and years.
Political paralysis and fragmentation is a luxury the EU may not be able to afford.

The world’s greatest exercise in democracy has ended by returning an aspiring autocrat to power.
Narendra Modi last week won his second term as India’s prime minister in a landslide victory that underscores the wave of populism currently sweeping much of the world.
This election was described by Mr Modi’s vanquished opponents as a battle for the “soul” and “idea” of India.
The result must serve as a call to arms for liberal Indian voices so poorly served by the political opposition.
It is hard not to admire Mr Modi’s charisma and the near-total political dominance he enjoys in India today.
He is a mesmerising orator and relentless campaigner who managed to transform this parliamentary election into a semi-presidential referendum on his personal style.
One secret to his popularity is his generic appeal to so many segments of the population.
As one observer told me on a recent visit: Mr Modi is to politics what tomato is to curry — you can chop him any way you like and mix him in with anything to suit your taste.
His unapologetic efforts to present himself as a strongman standing up to old enemies — especially Pakistan— are also a potent part of his appeal.
India’s first postcolonial prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was charismatic.
His daughter Indira Gandhi was strong.
But probably not since Mahatma Gandhi has the country followed a public figure who was both.
Still, Mr Modi is not universally popular.
One reason most of his predecessors preferred not to play the strongman was because they refused to unleash the nightmare of communal violence that has haunted India since its inception.
Around 14 per cent of the population, nearly 200m people, are Muslim, which makes India the world’s third-largest Muslim country.
Under Mr Modi’s tenure they have found themselves disenfranchised, discriminated against and sometimes worse.
In the past few years dozens of people have been killed and hundreds injured in attacks by Hindu nationalist vigilantes acting in the name of protecting cows.
Muslims have been the main targets.
Mr Modi cannot avoid some blame for these atrocities.
He has done very little to condemn or discourage the violence and many of his political allies and proxies have defended the perpetrators.
Mr Modi has also systematically crushed critical and dissenting voices in the media while persecuting political enemies using tools of the state.
The result has been an erosion of trust in the institutions that underpin Indian democracy.
For all the unsavoury authoritarian tactics and divisive communal messaging, Mr Modi and the BJP have been extraordinarily energetic while in power.
The government has launched numerous programmes to help the poor, cleaned up some corruption at the top of the system and encouraged digital transformation.
It has also made some serious mis-steps, including a disastrous attempt to cleanse the economy of “black money” by abolishing 85 per cent of the cash supply overnight.
The electorate appears willing to forgive such errors in part because the main opposition Congress party is so utterly uninspiring. Led by Rahul Gandhi, the bumbling fourth-generation scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, Congress is disorganised, riven by internal battles and divorced from the concerns of the electorate.
While Mr Modi has cleverly utilised fear to mobilise his base, he has also managed to capture the average Indian’s urge for self-betterment.
Meanwhile, Congress has persisted with its ethos of “povertarianism” and traditional appeal to self-pity.
As one prominent Indian journalist says, the contest between the BJP and Congress in this election was akin to watching the mafia take on Mickey Mouse.
In the wake of this crushing defeat, Congress should finally dispense with hereditary rule by a single family.
Only then could it present the strong opposition that is vital for the functioning of any democracy, especially one led by a leader with authoritarian tendencies.

China increased its subsidies to domestically listed companies to a record level last year to help them weather a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, in a move likely to further strain trade talks with Washington.
Payments by Beijing and local governments to listed companies rose 14 per cent year on year to Rmb153.8bn （$22.3bn） in 2018, according to corporate earnings data collected by financial database Wind.
“This data just reinforce the impression that Chinese companies start the race for business far ahead of their competitors,” said Scott Kennedy, director of the project on Chinese business and political economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
He said the disclosed payments exclude “a range of implicit subsidies and other non-tariff barriers”.
China’s economy expanded at 6.6 per cent last year, its slowest rate in almost three decades, because of weak credit growth and the worsening trade war with the US.
US president Donald Trump this month increased tariffs on $200bn Chinese goods and placed telecoms equipment maker Huawei, the country’s corporate champion, on a crippling export blacklist.
As part of their trade talks, Washington is trying to force Beijing to dismantle state support for the corporate sector that the US argues leads to overcapacity and gives Chinese companies an unfair advantage in global markets.
“There were many measures applied last year to support the economy and subsidies were one part,” said Xu Bin, a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, adding that the payments aimed “to offset losses companies suffer in an adverse global economic environment”.
The top recipient last year was oil company Sinopec, which gained Rmb7.5bn in subsidies.
Automakers also received some of the largest payments as car sales in China shrank for the first time in almost three decades, with state-owned Shanghai Auto receiving Rmb3.6bn.
Last year’s subsidies were equivalent to 4 per cent of listed companies’ Rmb3.7tn total net profits, according to Wind.
Revenue growth of listed companies slowed to 12.7 per cent, down nearly 7 per cent year on year in 2018.
The head of a Shanghai investment bank said: “Local governments increased the amount of subsidies for listed companies to maintain the employment rate and tax revenue.”
China typically hands subsidies to companies that participate in national infrastructure projects or help meet targets in technology research and development.
“When there’s a downturn more companies are willing to do government projects as a way to get subsides,” said Ivan Chung, associate managing director of Moody’s in Hong Kong.
Some companies depend on subsidies to survive.
Chang’an Automobile received state subsidies of Rmb2.87bn, more than its net profit of Rmb680m.
The group, a partner of US carmaker Ford, has laid off hundreds of workers in recent months.
The data cover only 3,545 listed companies and do not include private companies, which account for the bulk of China’s economy.
An estimate by Jiang Chao, analyst at brokerage Haitong Securities, put the total value of subsidies to the corporate sector in 2017 at Rmb430bn.
The US also subsidises domestic companies, with Fortune 100 companies receiving $3.2bn in federal grants between 2014 and 2017, according to American Transparency, a US think-tank.
Local governments in the US have also competed to offer multibillion tax breaks to attract investment by groups such as Amazon.
Beijing has promised to aid the corporate sector through tax cuts this year, which it says will be worth $298bn.
Profits at large industrial companies began to decline in November, and fell by their fastest rate in almost three-and-a-half years in April, according to official statistics.
“This falling profit trend will continue for most of 2019,” said Iris Pang, greater China economist for Dutch bank ING, citing continued declines in auto sales and the impact of the trade and tech war between China and the US.

President Donald Trump’s latest confrontation with China’s most important tech company may just have plunged the world into a technology cold war.
Efforts to limit the ability of Huawei to buy from suppliers reliant on American technology threaten to tie the hands of a company that aimed to become a key global supplier in the era of 5G mobile communications.
China’s control of information within its borders, through restrictions on access to the global internet, had already put it in a separate digital universe to much of the rest of the world.
Now, by cutting off Huawei, the US has taken a retaliatory step that points towards a near-total tech split.
But if this turns out to be a defining moment in Washington’s efforts to isolate an economic and political adversary, it has touched off an uncomfortable reaction in the global tech industry, which now finds itself on the frontline of a conflict that looks profoundly bad for business.
In a barely veiled attack on the White House, the US Semiconductor Industry Association this week called on its government to act on national security “in a manner that does not undermine the ability of the US semiconductor industry to compete globally”, adding that it needed to protect the country’s “leadership in key areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation telecommunications”.
There are also worries that limiting China’s access to global tech markets will usher in more perilous economic times. “If the US resorts to how it dealt with Russia in the cold war, this is the wrong playbook,” says one China tech executive. Trying to shut out a country with a $13tn economy and 1.3bn people “creates more risks for the global economy and security system”.
At the same time, the White House is facing a profound lack of confidence in its own ability to prosecute a successful economic war.
Many executives support the idea of challenging China over its tech strategy, says one veteran US policymaker.
But he adds: “A lot of us don’t have the confidence that this administration has the vision, the sophistication or the judgment to do so effectively.”
The Trump administration has been bent on taking its fight against Huawei to a new level.
And the fallout over the telecommunications equipment company has been quick to ripple through the supply chain far beyond US and Chinese borders, accentuating a schism already opened up by the trade war between the two countries.
Non-US companies that sell products with at least 25 per cent American content are also caught by the new restrictions.
Panasonic, the Japanese electronics group, has already stopped shipping some components to Huawei, and UK-based chip company Arm has halted licensing its designs.
The realignment in the global tech industry is already apparent in key hubs such as Taiwan.
The island’s companies manufacture and assemble the lion’s share of the components that go into everything from notebook computers to data centres to smartphones.
Over decades, they have built networks linking US patents and designs with Chinese labour to serve global markets.
That is now changing. Large Taiwanese server producers like Quanta and Wistron have moved production lines out of mainland China in recent months in response to concerns from customers, such as Google and Facebook, that servers produced in China could be compromised. The US-China clash is “a big opportunity, and we are well placed to benefit from it in the long term,” says a senior official in Taipei. “But there will be a lot of short-term pain.”
When it comes to confronting Beijing, Mr Trump has shown himself to be more concerned with issues of trade and economic rivalry, than national security.
But for the China hawks in his administration, hobbling Huawei has been a key step in what Washington sees as a long-term race for technological supremacy.
It also represents an alliance of convenience with White House aides such as Peter Navarro, the adviser on manufacturing, who want to force a more profound decoupling of US technology from China for trade reasons.
Two sources familiar with the situation say the president decided to sign the order against Huawei after his negotiators accused China of reneging on a trade deal.
At a hastily-called meeting in the White House, he said he wanted to hit Huawei hard to create leverage for the trade talks.
And he ordered the commerce department to add it to the so-called entity list, which makes it harder for US companies to provide hardware and software to the Chinese group.
The decision has brought the president into line with both the trade and security hawks in his administration. But it remains unclear whether he will continue to maintain a tough stance on Huawei, and other Chinese companies that could be hit by the executive order, once he strikes a trade deal.
“Longstanding concerns about Huawei, though well deserved, have definitely hitched a ride on the larger platform of the US-China trade talks,” says Michael Allen, managing partner at Beacon Global Strategies, a national security consultancy. “A debate previously confined to crowded national security circles — about whether China could tap into US communications — is now a part of the Trump ‘economic security is national security’ narrative.”
If the White House’s march towards a tech cold war has moved by fits and starts, and Mr Trump’s own objectives are not entirely clear, the US is at least starting from a position of considerable strength.
Chinese rivals are still a long way from reaching a position of self-reliance, despite the country’s recent successes in advanced technology research.
Sebastian Hou, an investment analyst at CLSA, estimates that Huawei, which accounts for 8-9 per cent of global semiconductor consumption, produces only around 30-35 per cent of its chips, excluding memory, in-house.
The company believes it can accelerate this to reach 90 per cent self-reliance.
Mr Hou estimates this will apply to 100 per cent of smartphones and around 80 per cent of telecoms infrastructure equipment.
But without access to the widely used US software, Huawei would find it hard to find buyers for its equipment.
Google’s decision this week to stop selling its Android operating system to Huawei for new handsets makes little difference in China, where Huawei should be able to convince buyers to switch to its operating system, now under development.
But customers are more wedded to Android in international markets.
Independent analyst Richard Windsor estimates it will lose all those sales, roughly half of the 200m smartphones it shipped last year.
Chinese companies are well aware of their vulnerabilities.
Speaking at Tencent’s Global Digital Ecosystem Summit on Tuesday, founder and chief executive Pony Ma, said: “If we do not continue to strengthen our efforts in fundamental research and core technologies, our digital economy would become a tall building built on sand and could not stand intact, let alone facilitate digital transformation into the new economy.”
Although the US looks to be in a strong position, a tech cold war could still rebound on it.
Beijing’s push for technological self-reliance has been given new urgency by the heightened tensions.
For many US policymakers, that is a price worth paying.
“If the technology industry in the US and China decouples to a certain extent, we are going to be OK,” says one US official.
Beijing has scope for retaliation. Levers at its disposal include blocking access to its market — a move that Goldman Sachs analysts estimate could reduce Apple’s earnings per share by nearly 30 per cent — delaying M&A deals or  dumping US Treasury bonds.
The importance of Chinese manufacturers in the electronics supply chain also puts the country in a powerful position to disrupt economic activity beyond its borders.
Gao Feng, a Chinese commerce ministry official, warned on Thursday that the US actions might pose “a great threat to the security of the global industrial and supply chain”.
This adds to the US tech sector’s feeling of exasperation with its own government.
“[Trump] has underestimated how deeply intertwined we are now,” says one US industry figure.
Already unhappy about the higher tariffs on imports from China, US tech companies that sell to Huawei are also being forced to abandon a significant global customer.
The reverberations are being felt most strongly in the semiconductor sector.
Hopes for a second-half bounce in demand had driven the main index of chip stock prices up by 50 per cent in the first four months of 2019.
Over the past four weeks, it has fallen back by nearly 20 per cent.
Mr Trump made efforts on Thursday to sound more conciliatory, by suggesting that there might still be a way to bring Huawei back into the fold as part of a wider trade deal.
Though at the same time, and with no apparent awareness of any contradiction, he insisted the company was “very dangerous, from a security standpoint”.
Even if Mr Trump can secure the elusive end to the trade war he started, it may do little to resolve deeper issues.
Most US tech executives sound resigned to a continuation of the status quo, rather than any serious concessions by Beijing to open its markets or end its internet blockade.
For China, the episode has reinforced an important lesson: tech security can only come from self-reliance.
The White House may just have taken a fateful step towards a tech cold war that lasts for years.

China’s ByteDance, owner of the popular TikTok streaming app, is taking a step into hardware to develop its own smartphone, according to two people familiar with the project.
ByteDance, whose $75bn valuation ranks it as one of the world’s biggest start-ups, plans to launch a phone preloaded with its own apps — which include newsfeeds, short video platforms and games — in a bid to further spread its reach.
The move comes as Chinese tech companies, spooked by the fallout from US bans on exports to Huawei, are ramping up their self-reliance.
ByteDance is one of the few tech companies from China to boast a large user base outside its home market, including in India and the US.
While several big US internet companies have sought to launch devices, success has mostly been elusive.
Though Google launched the Android operating system that powers the majority of the world’s smartphones, Facebook and Amazon’s own-brand phones were both abandoned.
HTC and Samsung launched devices based on the Facebook Home platform, which like Bytedance’s planned phone came pre-installed with its apps, but they flopped when it launched in 2013.
Buyers similarly shunned Amazon’s Fire phone, which was pulled a year after launch.
Analysts predict ByteDance’s phone could have a similar outcome.
“There’s basically no space for them in the mass market,” said Jia Mo, Shanghai-based analyst at Canalys.
“They lack experience and advantage in supply chain, in channels . . . so their likelihood of being successful is very low,” he added. “If they target only the niche market, maybe they have a chance by attracting niche customer groups through certain pre-installed software.”
ByteDance’s latest project, the brainchild of founder Zhang Yiming, follows its acquisition of a number of patents from Smartisan, a Chinese phonemaker, and subsequent recruitment of some of its staff.
Mr Zhang has long dreamt of a phone with ByteDance apps pre-installed, according to one person with knowledge of the secretive project.
But Chinese tech companies’ fears of hawkishness in Washington intensified last week when Google, in response to the US ban, cut Huawei’s access to anything more than its basic open source Android operating system.
The move dealt a blow that some analysts believe could cost the telecoms company its entire overseas sales.
Bytedance’s own international expansion has been helped by its acquisition of US lip-syncing Musical.ly app in 2017. But despite racking up huge numbers of downloads — passing 1bn in March — it has run up against regulators in India and the US, where it was fined a record $5.7m by the Federal Trade Commission for allegedly illegally collecting personal information from children.
Wang Xi, research manager at data consultancy IDC China, said the competitive domestic hardware market meant any newcomer would have to woo users with low prices and must-have content.
“So if they really will go down this path, I think they will probably let hardware lose money in the beginning and try to make up through service later,” he said. ByteDance declined to comment.

Fiat Chrysler and Renault are considering an exchange of shareholdings or investment in each other as part of wide-ranging tie-up talks that could extend to a full merger, according to people close to both carmakers.
Renault has agreed to delay any plans to merge with Japan’s Nissan in the short term if an agreement is reached with FCA, a condition stipulated by the Italian-American carmaker for its co-operation, according to two of the people.
Discussions between the two sides about joining forces were first reported by the Financial Times over the weekend.
A deal would help the companies pool resources as they battle to survive in an industry beset by falling sales and technological disruption.
The two are expected to announce on Monday that they are in talks to collaborate in several areas, including connectivity, electric vehicle technology and manufacturing platforms, the people said.
The companies are also likely to say that discussions include the possibility of an exchange of shareholdings, either through a share swap or an investment in each other’s business.
A full merger is also being considered, according to two people close to the plans.
The condition of Renault shelving plans to merge with Nissan, which is unlikely to be included in Monday’s expected announcement, would cool immediate tensions between the French and Japanese partners, which have fired up in the wake of former alliance leader Carlos Ghosn’s arrest eight months ago.
The delay to the merger would also allow the two companies to focus on their own businesses, rather than the internal politics of or possible changes to their alliance.
Discussions between Renault and FCA are ongoing and may not lead to a deal, people close to the talks cautioned.
However, Renault is expected to hold a board meeting immediately after the announcement on Monday morning to discuss the proposals.
Renault and FCA declined to comment.
A tie-up with FCA would allow Renault to broaden its options as its global alliance with Nissan is grappling with deteriorating profits in the US and an industry-wide shift to self-driving electric vehicles.
The reason behind the talks was purely strategic and there was no intent of strong-arming Nissan over other potential scenarios, according to one person close to the French company’s senior management.
“It’s really a win-win for everyone. It’s not to hurt or to disavow anyone,” said another person briefed on Renault’s thinking.
Still, the talks are expected to put pressure on Renault’s longtime partner, Nissan, which was not directly involved in the discussions even though they may result in FCA joining the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance in the future, according to people close to the Japanese group.
Some Nissan insiders responded with scepticism to reports of the talks. They said they viewed the move as a tactic by Renault to put pressure on the Japanese group, as the French carmaker pushed for a full merger in the wake of the arrest and ousting of their former boss Mr Ghosn.
The same people said they believed there had been a specific attempt by Renault to advance its talks with FCA far enough before mid-June so the issue would be raised by Nissan shareholders before its annual meeting in the later part of next month.
Nissan declined to comment.

Chip sanctions are kryptonite to Chinese tech ambitions.
US blacklisting of Huawei has prompted a supplier exodus.
Panasonic and Arm are the latest to flee.
Arm’s decision to stop licensing microprocessor designs to the Chinese telecoms equipment group hurts most.
Its designs dominate mobile chip technology.
Arm may now play little part in China’s push to develop indigenous capabilities.
Samsung, Qualcomm and Apple are among the titans that use Arm architecture.
The Android operating system, which Google has threatened to pull from Huawei phones, runs on Arm chips.
They also power Huawei’s cloud servers and 5G base stations.
Huawei, which critics claim is linked to the Chinese military, did not see this coming.
Its plan B included stockpiling imported microprocessors and sourcing others from wholly owned HiSilicon.
But HiSilicon also uses Arm designs.
Good homegrown alternatives would take years to create.
China’s dependence on foreign chips has been cruelly exposed.
Supply chain disruptions can only be avoided if reliance on a single supplier or, in this case, a certain country is less than one-tenth of total sources.
Huawei gets more than half of all its chips from the US.
Nor is the ban set to trigger a Great Leap Forward towards Chinese self-sufficiency in chips, as it may in operating systems.
Billions of tiny switches on a silicon wafer are difficult to reverse engineer.
Hefty subsidies and tax breaks have only lifted Chinese self-reliance in low-value chips.
Only technology of “US origin” is blacklisted.
Arm is based in the UK and owned by SoftBank, a Japanese investor with Chinese connections.
There is a slim chance that only a chunk of Arm technology is exempt from the ban.
China would hardly let the crisis threaten the future of privately owned Huawei.
But US president Donald Trump has cornered this national champion.
Economic nationalism is the new arms race.
In tech, China is a superpower whose own superpowers may now be sharply diminished.

Once, when I ran a department, I had an office door that slammed shut.
To keep it open, I wedged a piece of wood under it.
Every couple of weeks one of my team would walk in and kick the wood away to close the door.
They wanted a confidential chat.
In my head, I called these “Jonny Wilkinson discussions” because the door-closing reminded me of the former England rugby star’s elegant leg swing as he kicked for the posts.
Sometimes the Jonny Wilkinson talk was about an internal squabble.
More often it was about a personal or family problem, of which there was a huge variety.
When I give talks to managers about how to deal with their roles, I always get a smile of recognition when I ask: “Before you became a manager, did you realise that so many things happened to people?”
Employees not only have their own problems; they have their extended families’ problems, too.
People get ill.
So do their parents.
Marriages break up, children fall off bikes or get caught with drugs.
These catastrophes, minor and major, affect people’s concentration and mood and often necessitate time off work.
There are hospital appointments, care home visits, child psychologist reviews, court appearances.
The problems are often serious and usually confidential.
As a manager you carry not only your own problems, but your team’s, too.
It is one of the less-discussed burdens of the job.
The intensity can overwhelm you.
So how can you cope?
First, by realising there is no escaping this part of the job.
If you do not deal with people’s worries, their work will suffer, affecting the rest of the team.
Left to fester, problems turn into crises.
So that open door matters. People need to feel they can speak to you. If they are reticent, at least give them the opportunity. If someone makes an uncharacteristic series of mistakes, call them in for a talk. After reviewing the work, ask: “Is anything else bothering you?” They may not feel like telling you. They have their own confidences to keep. But at least you have shown you are open to talking.
Second, remember that at work outcomes are more important than inputs.
What matters is what people produce, not the hours they spend at their desks.
Often, people are happy to work at home, or in their own time, in return for the space they need to deal with whatever is bothering them.
They may need more extended time off, although some resist that, usually because office routine is comforting.
“Work is what is keeping me going,” they sometimes say.
If they do need time off, you can reshuffle others’ tasks, get someone in temporarily, or do the work yourself.
Those you accommodate usually come back ready to give you far more.
If you explain what is happening, maintaining whatever confidentiality is required, the rest of the team generally will not mind mucking in.
They realise that if anything happened to them, you would give them the same consideration.
Third, keep your own head clear.
However serious your team members’ troubles are, and some of them are distressingly so, you must carry on for everyone else, and for your own wellbeing.
There is usually someone your team member knows you have to tell （make this clear） — your own boss and, almost always, the human resources department.
You are not a counsellor or psychologist （unless that is what you actually are） and, while you can offer general encouragement and advice, you are not usually qualified to solve the problem.
Do not try to compare the team member’s problem to one of your own, unless you have had exactly the same difficulty and your experience of a facility or helper might be useful.
Even then, suggest with discretion.
Your HR department may be helpful in finding the right help, or not.
Your company may offer helplines.
If there is a corporate health insurance scheme, it will be able to suggest doctors or therapists.
Check regularly how your team members are getting on, regulate how much work they can cope with and how quickly they can return.
Remember, too, that they have their own networks and resources.
They are responsible, finally, for themselves and their families.
They are adults and the best thing you can do to help them is to remember that.

As the global tech industry surveys the fallout from the US assault on China’s Huawei, cautious optimism is growing in Seoul that a hit to the world’s biggest telecoms equipment company could be a boon for Samsung Electronics.
The South Korean technology group, one of the world’s biggest producers of smartphones and computer chips, has until now struggled in a global network equipment market that is increasingly dominated by Huawei.
But analysts said that might soon change after the latest moves by the Trump administration to curb the sale of US-made components to the Chinese company.
“If the biggest player is having serious issues in all the major foreign markets . . . then naturally Samsung’s prospects will go up,” said Sanjeev Rana, a Seoul-based analyst with CLSA.
The US is wary of what it claims are links between Shenzhen-based Huawei and the Chinese government, as well as the potential of Huawei’s equipment to be used for spying.
Huawei denies such claims.
Washington has for months been pressuring other countries to follow its lead in blocking the Chinese company from supplying equipment from the next phase of their telecoms infrastructure.
This month, the Trump administration ratcheted up pressure, adding Huawei to an export blacklist requiring it to obtain licences to buy US technology.
The timing is positive for Samsung’s aspirations in 5G, just as two of its key businesses — smartphones and computer chips — have been hit by slowing global demand, analysts said.
The Seoul-based company has previously announced plans to boost its market share in 5G to 20 per cent by 2020.
According to Dell’Oro Group, the research company, Samsung had 2.5 per cent of the telecoms equipment market in 2018, compared with Huawei’s 28.6 per cent.
Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson were the next biggest players with 17 per cent and 13.4 per cent, respectively.
Samsung did not comment on the US export controls against Huawei.
A spokesperson said it is engaged on 4G and 5G networks with US companies including AT&T, Sprint and Verizon.
In Japan it is working with NTT DoCoMo and KDDI “to ensure the technology works and to develop 5G business models”.
Analysts said Samsung has also gained an edge from the local market after South Korea last month rolled out the world’s first 5G mobile service.
According to a Fitch Solutions report, the company has sold more than 50,000 base stations in South Korea, compared with Nokia, which had shipped fewer than 5,000.
“Samsung has emerged as a key supplier in South Korea’s 5G rollout . . . the company will be keen to focus on the new technology to drive growth as it suffers from a slowing semiconductor and smartphone refresh cycle,” the Fitch analysts said.
Samsung’s efforts come as Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia are already locked in intense competition to dominate the age of 5G telecoms.
A study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think-tank, showed that of 288 instances where 5G was tested, piloted or made available on a commercial basis around the world until April 2019, Huawei’s equipment was deployed in 29.5 per cent of the cases, Ericsson in 29.5 per cent, and Nokia in 22.6 per cent.
The regional breakdown was also fairly even, with the exception of North America, where the European providers had a clear lead.
However, officials and telecoms companies from London to Wellington are reconsidering the use of Huawei’s 5G technology following US security warnings.
And the latest US export restrictions on the sale of components to Huawei have “led to chaos in 5G rollout plans globally”, Edison Lee and Timothy Chau, analysts at Jefferies, wrote in a research note on Friday.
Market watchers diverge as to the length of the disruption that could result if Huawei cannot source the equipment it needs from the US for its 5G business.
The Jefferies analysts expected Huawei customers outside China to take a “wait-and-see” approach given the potential cost increase of “30 per cent-plus” of switching to another supplier.
Mr Rana from CLSA, however, did not expect a lengthy delay.
“I don’t think countries are keen to delay their 5G plans too much, so in that case they will try to work with whatever is available,” he said.
Samsung is hoping that will be its moment.
While Samsung’s network equipment business failed to keep pace with global peers, analysts said the company has built about a 10 per cent share in the equipment market for 4G networks.
The company has for at least five years been investing heavily in research and development and registering patents with the target of making 5G a future growth driver, according to a person familiar with the matter.
These efforts have ramped up with the smartphone market, one of the company’s biggest revenue streams, reaching saturation.
The company has also made a series of strategic acquisitions recently to further boost its 5G presence.
“As of now Samsung is one of the key players. Their equipment is actually being used in 5G networks in [South] Korea, so there is a proven track record,” said Mr Rana.

Australian prime minister Scott Morrison will visit the Solomon Islands on Sunday in his first overseas trip since being re-elected, as his government joins other western nations in moving to challenge growing Chinese influence in the South Pacific.
“My first overseas visit following the election will be to a key member of our Pacific family, Solomon Islands, which is one of Australia’s nearest and most important neighbours,” said Mr Morrison in a statement.
“The Pacific is front and centre of Australia’s strategic outlook. I look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Sogavare as we set out a partnership of deeper engagement and build on the family and community bonds Australia shares with the Pacific.”
The visit is part of a wider push by Canberra to bolster diplomatic and military presence in the region, which it has traditionally considered to be its sphere of influence. The US and its allies are becoming increasingly concerned about China’s growing diplomatic clout in the region, which contains several small island nations that are among a dwindling number of countries that recognise Taiwan against the wishes of Beijing.

Fifty years ago, no one naming the greatest challenge facing Asian nations would have put retirement planning as the region’s most intractable problem.
Life expectancy in India in 1970 was 47 years.
In China, it was 59.
Getting to old age was a rarity and if you made it to your 90s, poverty was not an appreciably greater threat than in your youth.
Most extended families in rural Asia were poor but supported the oldest members.
Since then, the economic revolution of the Asian century has brought prosperity to billions.
Greater income has meant widespread urbanisation, smaller families and fewer multigenerational households.
Better healthcare has extended lives by up to 20 years.
Improvements in living standards have reduced poverty but not yet made populations rich in absolute terms.
Many Asian countries risk turning grey before their people become wealthy.
The Asian Development Bank estimates that by 2050 Asia will account for about half of the global population aged more than 60.
Today, millions of Asians face the prospect of ending up poor and isolated.
The World Economic Forum suggests that the retirement savings gap in China is projected to grow to $119tn in the next 30 years.
Doing nothing is not an option.
Better and more retirement planning has to be a priority for policymakers.
This is not to say Asian governments are strangers to the demographic time-bomb.
Many have already taken substantial action to try to shore up financial sustainability.
The mathematical reality is that government safety nets will be insufficient.
Taxes on the young will not fund the old indefinitely.
Culturally, Asians are great savers but they often make poor investment choices, such as saving in cash rather than increasing their wealth sufficiently or compounding their returns to sustain retirement spending needs.
Moreover, their savings are increasingly stretched between short and long-term goals.
Part of the answer must be greater individual responsibility.
This will mean rethinking the way Asians interact with pensions and empowering people to make better decisions about their own financial wellbeing.
The question for governments then is how do you build private （ie voluntary） pension structures and put in place incentives to encourage or require more saving without overstepping freedoms?
There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but there are common levers.
First, policymakers need to be clear about what they are aiming for and secure public backing.
Is it a minimum standard of living for everyone in retirement or is it providing people with a target retirement income?
Define the problem that private pensions will fix.
Second, harness human nature by using the power of inertia.
Put workers into contributory retirement plans at a particular rate by default, unless they opt out （few will）.
Quiet nudges encourage greater personal responsibility.
Understand how the mind hinders investment decisions and counter that with smart system design, such as steering people to diversified, long-term investment options.
Most do not have the time or expertise to invest on their own and people often underestimate how much risk they can take in investing over a long period; conversely, they take on too much risk when time is short.
Third, use data and behavioural tools to influence conduct.
In addition to automatically enrolling people in savings plans, incentivise them to save.
Require employers sponsoring retirement plans to match workers’ contributions by a certain percentage.
The promise of “free money” will encourage people to put sums aside.
Fourth, plan to keep people engaged.
Private pensions should provide personalised account statements that show progress towards a goal.
Present accumulated wealth as the level of income it will provide in retirement.
If retirement savings look like a bank account balance, they may seem easier to spend.
Ensure individuals have the information they need, when they need it.
Help people consider how retirement savings can be converted into income streams once they are in retirement.
Provide guidance on how asset management and insurance products can help meet an individual’s income goals.
Fifth and finally, policymakers need to establish a review process to measure how well the system is doing.
Keep the debate based in fact.
This will be your friend when political pressures come to bear.
Asian governments urgently need long-term, coherent pension policies that make it easier for individuals to plan their savings and take active ownership.
The trade-offs in designing these policies are complex.
What succeeds in one country’s retirement system may fall short in another.
Constructing better retirement systems to help Asia’s ageing populations has to be an immediate priority.

North Korea executed its special envoy to the US, Kim Hyok Chol, and four other foreign ministry officials who carried out working-level talks for the failed summit with the US in February, a South Korean newspaper said on Friday.
Kim Yong Chol, a former counterpart of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the run-up to the Hanoi summit, had also been subjected to forced labour and ideological education, the Chosun Ilbo said.
Chosun, South Korea’s most widely circulated daily, said the massive purge appears to be aimed at quelling growing discontent in North Korea in the wake of the failed Hanoi summit, where US President Donald Trump rejected North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s offer to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear complex in return for sanctions relief.
Chosun cited an unnamed North Korean source as saying that Kim Hyok Chol was investigated and executed at Mirim Airport in March with the four foreign ministry officials.
Kim Yong Chol has been sent to Jagang Province for forced labour after his dismissal, the newspaper said.
Shin Hye Yong, the interpreter for Kim Jong Un at the Hanoi meeting, has also been detained at a political prison camp for undermining the North Korean leader’s authority by making a critical mistake in interpretation, Chosun added.
Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, has also been lying low since the summit breakdown, the paper said.
Ms Kim, who often accompanied her brother for major events, has not been seen in public since the summit.
“We are not aware of Ms Kim’s track record since the Hanoi meeting... We understand that Kim Jong Un has made her lie low,” an unnamed South Korean government official told Chosun.
North Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun hinted at the purge, saying in a Thursday commentary that “Acting like one is revering the leader in front [of others] but dreaming of something else when one turns around, is an anti-party, anti-revolutionary act that has thrown away the moral fidelity toward the leader and such people will not avoid the stern judgement of the revolution.”
“There are traitors and turncoats who only memorise words of loyalty toward the leader and even change according to the trend of the time,” the commentary said.
It is the first time since the December 2013 execution of Jang Song Thaek, then North Korea’s second most powerful man and Kim Jong Un’s uncle, that Rodong used expressions like “anti-party, anti-revolutionary” and “stern judgement”.
Seoul’s spy agency and unification ministry in charge of dealing with North Korea declined to confirm the Chosun report.

A diffuse alliance of pro-EU parties has largely held its ground in European elections, after a bruising battle with anti-establishment groups in which Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche was narrowly defeated in France.
Turnout rose for the first time in 40 years, as voters returned a more fragmented pro-EU majority, with traditional centre-ground parties losing seats to Greens and Liberals.
Eurosceptic and far-right parties made modest gains, securing roughly a quarter of all MEP seats.
The results across the EU’s 28 member states will have a decisive impact on the political direction in Brussels for the next five years, determining the parliament’s stance on sensitive issues such as green taxes and international trade deals.
They will also weigh heavily on the race for the bloc’s top jobs.
In a sign of the jockeying that will start, Mr Macron has invited Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s Socialist prime minister, to dinner at the Elysée palace in Paris on Monday night as negotiations over candidates for top EU posts accelerate following the elections.
The Elysée said Mr Macron would also meet other European leaders over lunch in Brussels on Tuesday before an informal EU summit in the evening.
The election results spell the end of the centre-left and centre-right joint hold over the legislature since 1979, giving way to a more divided pro-EU bloc that will include up to four parties.
“The two big party blocs no longer have an automatic majority,” said Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the European Policy Centre think-tank.
“Decision-making will be more difficult in the parliament — but certainly it will continue to function.”
Rightwing Eurosceptics also made important gains, notably in France and Italy, but without amassing the numbers to make a decisive difference in the EU’s main legislative chamber.
Most notably, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally emerged claiming victory in a bitter fight with Mr Macron, which became an important test of the French president’s authority.
Mr Macron’s list took 22.5 per cent of the vote, trailing Ms Le Pen’s far-right group by just 1 percentage point, according to parliament estimates.
Eurosceptic, anti-establishment and hard-right parties also topped polls in the UK, Italy, Poland and Hungary, according to parliament provisional results and estimates.
Nigel Farage’s Brexit party was in contention to be the biggest single national party in the parliament, vying with German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU alliance and Matteo Salvini’s rightwing League in Italy.
Germany’s left-right grand coalition faced a potentially significant electoral shock, with the Green party making a historic breakthrough, taking 20.7 per cent of the vote.
This pushed the centre-left Social Democratic party into third place for the first time in nationwide elections, raising pressure on party leaders to rethink their federal alliance with the centre-right.
With votes shifting to smaller parties, the centre-right European People’s party （EPP） held on to 179 seats in the EU legislature, down from 221 in 2014, according to provisional results published by the parliament early on Monday.
The Socialist group fell from 191 to 150 seats.
The traditional centre-ground pan-EU parties lost ground to the Liberals, who rose from 67 to 107 seats, according to the provisional results.
The Greens climbed from 50 to 70, boosted by their performance in Germany.

Aggression against trading partners has a way of blowing back on the domestic economy.
That is one trade policy lesson that the current US White House ought perhaps to have learnt by now.
President Donald Trump, who likes to claim that import tariffs are a tax on Chinese companies rather than on American importers and ultimately consumers, also seems to have been taken by surprise by the impact of Chinese retaliation to his unilateral tariffs.
Beijing is acutely aware that America’s export-oriented farmers are vulnerable to being cut off from their markets overseas.
US agricultural goods, especially soyabeans, were one of the first targets for Chinese reciprocal action.
While it is quite possible this was urged on him by Congress and members of his administration rather than being his personal instinct, Mr Trump’s response is to bail out farmers who have thus lost export markets.
Having already announced one round of aid last year totalling $12bn, the president is now planning another, this time of $16bn.
There are some positives to the latest policy.
The form that the large bulk of it is likely to take — “direct payments” to farmers rather than actually buying surplus output — is relatively non-distortive of trade and stops short of being a gross violation of World Trade Organization rules.
Similarly, Mr Trump has dropped an initial idea to buy up billions of dollars’ worth of commodities and send them as food aid to developing countries, an idea that creates more problems than it solves.
The problems with the handout though, remain manifold.
It is inequitable to pick out a particular subset of the economy that has been hurt by US trade policies — especially one that is already heavily subsidised — and bail it out to the exclusion of other producers.
Research by the Financial Times shows that much of the first round of agricultural handouts were captured by well-off farmers, many of whom have long experience in structuring their companies to maximise federal subsidy receipts.
There appears little concern in the White House for the tens of millions of much less well-off American households who will be suffering from higher bills as a result of the US’s own tariffs.
More generally, it is a damaging idea to buy off particular domestic groups to facilitate a global trade war.
Any short-term palliative to mask the pain of an ill-advised act of economic harm should not be welcomed.
It is one thing to cushion the blow of economic dislocation caused by shifts in trade because of changes in costs or technology, such as increased price competition in the manufacturing sector from low-cost trading partners.
It is quite another in effect to buy the silence of a small and well-organised interest group of producers to pursue a trade policy that attempts to distort the world trading system.
Whether these handouts will help Mr Trump politically is not clear.
Hitherto he has often given the impression that his popularity in small-town and rural America depends on a direct emotional appeal to voters, rather than addressing concerns such as jobs and income.
Certainly trade policy, as opposed to other issues, did not appear to hurt the Republicans’ fortunes a great deal in the midterm elections in November.
America’s farmers are highly productive and efficient.
They need open markets and the minimum of state interference.
There may be justifications for the escalating trade war the US administration is waging with China.
But launching such action and then patching up the domestic victims with public money is a bad idea.

After pouring more than $20bn into companies that bring meals to your door, such as Deliveroo in Europe, Swiggy in India and DoorDash in the US, tech investors are now looking at the other side of the table: how to make sure the right food is available at the right place at the right time to be delivered.
“The success of Uber Eats, DoorDash and others suggests there is a demographic shift towards consumption of prepared meals at home,” said Michael Ronen, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. “The time is now to try and stand up supply that is more efficient against that demand.”
Venture capitalists have alighted on the best solution: kitchens that only serve delivery customers, known as “cloud”, “ghost” or “dark” kitchens, that exploit a combination of advanced food preparation, underused real estate and algorithm-driven optimisation to lower overheads and increase output.
But the various approaches taken by start-ups are as different as sushi and fish ‘n’ chips.
Some are focused simply on real estate, setting up and hiring out kitchens in the right urban locations to serve the new demand, or commandeering defunct high-street restaurants.
These include Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick’s new start-up, City Storage Systems, which trades as CloudKitchens in the US, and London-based Karma Kitchen.
Those property ventures also create a new opportunity for kitchen services companies that focus on making the food, such as Dubai-based KitOpi, which operates in London and the Middle East.
Eccie Newton, co-founder of Karma Kitchen, likens her concept to “WeWork for kitchens”, renting out space to different businesses at different times of day. “Food delivery is definitely a growing part of our business, especially for the evening shifts,” she said. Shared kitchen space at Karma’s first location in London’s Tower Hamlets neighbourhood can cost about £1,500 a month, compared with tens of thousands of pounds upfront to build a new kitchen.
Other players offer different combinations of facilities and services.
Kitchen United, a Google-backed start-up, plans to open more than a dozen delivery kitchens across the US this year.
It charges a monthly membership fee that includes the premises, back-of-house services such as dishwashing and access to its technology system for processing online orders from a range of delivery apps.
“Most quick-service restaurant chains employ 30 to 50 people,” said Jim Collins, chief executive of Kitchen United. “In our facility, we have designed the service stack so they only need two people per shift. It cuts their labour cost by 75-80 per cent.”
There is also a benefit for diners: faster deliveries of hotter meals.
“Freshness is the killer metric on whether consumers are going to reorder,” Mr Collins said.
Building on this delivery kitchen infrastructure is a new wave of start-ups hoping to create brands that are as recognisable to users of delivery apps as Domino’s or McDonald’s.
“Virtual restaurants” such as Taster or Keatz work closely with delivery platforms to identify areas of unmet demand, whether in location or cuisine, then rent out space from a business such as CloudKitchens or Karma.
“The market is mature enough to build a delivery-only brand,” said Anton Soulier, a former Deliveroo executive who founded Taster in 2017. “My ambition is to create the Five Guys of Vietnamese food or the Shake Shack of Korean fried chicken . . . These [delivery] platforms need guys like us because they can’t rely on burgers and sushi, at some point they need a bit more diversity in food.”
Taster uses its own algorithms to forecast each week’s sales, bringing efficiencies in ordering ingredients.
It is building a following for its brands, such as Mission Saigon and Out-Fry, on Instagram and through its food packaging, to attract repeat customers.
With some advance preparation, Mr Soulier claims a Taster kitchen can turn around an order in three minutes, compared with 15 minutes at a traditional restaurant. “The beauty of the model is restaurants and food are the least scalable business in the world,” he said. “We are trying to make it more scalable and expand very quickly.” But the food-delivery companies themselves, such as Swiggy, Deliveroo and Uber Eats, are also looking to bite off certain parts of this food tech “stack”.
Deliveroo has been testing dozens of “Editions” — often preparing food in converted shipping containers in car parks — for two years, while Uber Eats recently opened its first kitchen in Paris.
That is where the strategies of SoftBank and Naspers, two of the biggest investors in these food-delivery apps, begin to diverge.
Naspers is betting that soup-to-nuts vertical integration will win out.
“There is a lot of value in owning the consumer interface and getting to know your customers,” said Bob van Dijk, chief executive of Naspers, which is an investor in Swiggy and Delivery Hero.
That data can inform gaps in the offering, such as users searching for salads in Bangalore.
“We have looked at one or two companies that make food and do dark kitchens but we didn’t get our head around it.”
SoftBank, on the other hand, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in what at first would appear to be a very analogue, offline business: car parks.
In December, it took a stake in ParkJockey, a Miami-based start-up that makes technology for car parking.
At the same time, it acquired Impark and Citizens, two of the biggest car park operators in North America, giving ParkJockey more than 4,500 locations.
SoftBank’s Mr Ronen sees these central urban properties as a “strategic asset”.
“Car parking is an underutilised piece of land,” he said.
ParkJockey, which is now valued at more than $1bn, has been experimenting with car-park kitchens since 2016, when it opened its first site in London.
“I do see parking garages as the warehouses of the new economy,” said Ari Ojalvo, ParkJockey’s chief executive.
“The idea of putting a kitchen inside a container and then dropping that into a garage came very naturally to me.” The premises are well ventilated, quiet and close to customers, he explains.
However, despite their tech-industry backers, Mr Ojalvo and Kitchen United’s Mr Collins say that their bricks-and-mortar businesses are very different to internet companies.
Fixing a kitchen problem requires more than a software update, said Mr Ojalvo.
“These are serious operations — it’s like the military.”
Mr Collins said he had actively tried to discourage investment from the usual Silicon Valley venture capitalists, because of the significant spending required on buildings, cookers and dishwashers.
“If we decrease our capex, we are not opening facilities,” he said. “For a lot of the traditional tech investment communities, it’s hard for them to get their mind around that.”
But still, many VCs believe that however messy and logistically complicated it is, the food industry is about to be disrupted just as thoroughly as department stores and taxi operators.
“A hundred and fifty years ago, most people made their own clothes,” said Mr van Dijk. “I’m fairly convinced that 20 years from now, we will mostly not make our own food.”

President Donald Trump has played down the significance of recent North Korean missile launches, saying in Japan that the tests did not bother him in comments that appeared to undermine John Bolton, his national security adviser.
“North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Mr Trump tweeted on the second day of his four-day state visit to Japan, which will include talks about North Korea.
His comment came a day after Mr Bolton told reporters in Tokyo that there was “no doubt” that two sets of recent North Korean missile launches had breached UN Security Council resolutions banning ballistic missile tests.
“I think the prime minister and president are going to talk about making sure the integrity of the UN Security Council resolutions are maintained,” Mr Bolton said just hours before Air Force One landed in Tokyo on Saturday evening.
Mr Trump is expected to discuss North Korea during his meetings with Mr Abe. The US president played golf with the Japanese prime minister on Sunday morning before accompanying Mr Abe to watch the final day of a Sumo championship. The two leaders will also have further talks on Monday after Mr Trump has an audience with Emperor Naruhito, who recently ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne after his father became the first emperor to abdicate in 200 years.
North Korea this month launched three ballistic missiles over the course of several days, marking the first such launches since 2017.
Some experts interpreted the move as an attempt to put pressure on the US to ease the denuclearisation demands that Mr Trump made during his failed summit with Kim Jong Un in Hanoi in February.
Mr Trump originally said that nobody was “happy” with the tests, but he has since played down concerns, saying he thought Mr Kim was intent on reaching a deal that would remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
“I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me,” Mr Trump said in his tweet on Saturday.
In the weeks since the missile tests, North Korea has shown no sign of wanting to rush back to the negotiating table.
North Korea’s foreign ministry on Friday said talks would not resume unless the US took a softer approach on denuclearisation.
“Unless the US puts aside the current method of calculation and comes forward with a new method of calculation . . . dialogue will never be resumed,” a foreign ministry official was quoted as saying by North Korean state media.
Further fuelling tension, Pyongyang this week issued a fresh rebuke over the US seizure of a North Korean cargo ship used to help Pyongyang export coal in contravention of UN sanctions.
The US seized the ship named Wise Honest last year, but the move was not made public until early May as part of a request to a US court to allow the US to take ownership of the vessel.
Han Tae Song, North Korea’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, told Reuters this week that the ship was “the biggest issue” in improving ties and that Washington had to make a “big decision” on easing sanctions before talks could resume.

In a factory beside a paddy field on the outskirts of a small city in central China, one of the core components of the modern global economy is being produced.
Inside a warren of cement and steel pipes, rock — mined in Australia — is heated to 1,000C in a giant coal-fired boiler.
It is then leached with acid, dried and purified into a fine white powder that carries the charge inside a battery that enables an electric car to drive.
The product, lithium carbonate, sells for more than $11,500 a tonne and global demand is expected to double by 2023, according to Volkswagen.
“This all used to be countryside,” a young staff member says in the company electric car, a black Tesla Model S, as it approaches the factory gates.
The city of Xinyu supplied lithium to China’s nuclear weapons industry in the 1960s, part of Mao Zedong’s push to place industry deep into the rural heartland of the country in case of a nuclear attack. Now the city supplies Tesla, BMW and VW, making it a vital node on the  global electric car supply chain — the 21st-century equivalent of the refineries, pipelines and ships that supported the age of oil-based transport which batteries could eventually replace.
In the space of a few years Chinese companies have become some of the world’s largest producers of lithium, a lightweight metal that is a key  raw material for batteries. They have bought up mines from Australia to South America and are building plants in China to make lithium chemicals and batteries.
The latest example of China’s ability to channel prodigious amounts of capital to fast growing industries, the country produced over 60 per cent of the world’s lithium in April, compared with less than 1 per cent from the US, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
China’s dominance in the electric car supply chain has triggered growing concerns in a trade-war obsessed Washington and Brussels, with both fearing that they could be squeezed out of the next generation of industry.
At the beginning of May two US senators, Lisa Murkowski and Joe Manchin, proposed a bipartisan bill designed to boost US production of critical minerals such as lithium.
And the European Investment Bank has  pledged €350m to back Swedish battery start-up Northvolt, which aims to build a battery factory in Sweden and source raw minerals such as lithium from Europe.
At a time when western governments are  watching Chinese industrial policy for signs of unfair advantage, one of the interesting features of its new prominence in lithium is that it has not been achieved by the state-owned companies. Instead, it is the product of a group of entrepreneurs who “jumped into the sea”, as the Chinese call the launch of a private business — sensing an opportunity in batteries for mobile phones and then electric cars. Revenues for Ganfeng Lithium and its larger Shenzhen-listed rival  Tianqi Lithium have risen from around $100m a year to over $1bn in a decade, joining the ranks of the largest producers.
“The Wild West nature of Chinese capitalism has allowed companies to grow that quickly,” says Sam Jaffe, managing director of Cairn Energy Research Advisors, who analyses the battery market. “The government gives signals that a land rush is starting and then you have these entrepreneurs that get in their stagecoaches and gallop as fast as they can to get to the land. Some of them win [but] a lot of them lose.”
For most of the 20th century the US was the largest producer of lithium, but the Kings Mountain mine in North Carolina shut in the 1980s after competition from Chile. After that the market was dominated by a cosy oligopoly known as the Big Three: SQM of Chile, which was controlled by the son-in-law of the country’s former dictator Augusto Pinochet, and US producers Albemarle and FMC. In 2015, Albemarle acquired rival US producer Rockwood and last year FMC split off its lithium business into a separate entity, New York-listed Livent.
Founded in 2000 by Li Liangbin, who previously worked for a state-owned lithium plant, Ganfeng began life as a customer of SQM, helping to purchase the lithium extracted from the Atacama Desert in Chile. In his office in Shanghai, vice-chairman Wang Xiaoshen remembers that in 2004 Mr Li offered a 15 per cent stake in Ganfeng to SQM, in order to secure lithium supplies.
“At that time SQM hired Deloitte to do due diligence and after that [SQM] quit. It said ‘no thank you’. Ganfeng at that time was a very small company,” recalls Mr Wang, who had worked for the country’s first lithium plant in the far western city of Urumqi, in Xinjiang.
Instead, Ganfeng became a competitor: listing on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2010 and starting to secure supplies of lithium around the world.
In September 2015 it bought a stake in the Mount Marion mine in Western Australia, eventually building this into a 50 per cent stake.
It also has a 9 per cent stake in another Australian miner Pilbara Minerals, which owns one of the largest hard rock deposits of lithium, the Pilgangoora project that came with a 10-year supply agreement for its lithium.
This week Ganfeng said it would buy a  30 per cent stake in London-listed Bacanora Minerals, which is developing a lithium project in northern Mexico.
Ganfeng agreed a 10-year supply deal with VW last month.
The carmaker aims to launch more than 70 electric car models over the next 10 years — a target of 22m electric vehicles by 2028.
“Lithium will in the near future be one of the most sought-after raw materials on earth,” VW said.
But it is in Argentina where Ganfeng’s most ambitious project is taking shape, one that could turn it into a truly global company.
In 2018 Ganfeng bought a 38 per cent stake held in the Cauchari-Olaroz project from SQM.
Then in April it agreed to boost its stake in the project to 50 per cent, paying $160m in a deal that is set to close in June.
Situated in one of Argentina’s poorest areas, in the far north-west Jujuy province, the project will extract lithium from brine beneath the desert by evaporating it in the fierce desert sun. It aims to begin production in the second half of 2020, with a target of 25,000 tonnes a year of lithium carbonate.
“If you look at the long term  the demand is coming,” Ganfeng’s Mr Wang says. “This year traditional [carmakers] have launched their EV models. So that will generate demand for sure.”
In the same area as Cauchari is a solar power plant being built by a Chinese construction company and backed by Import-Export Bank of China.
With 1.2m solar panels it will be the largest solar plant in South America.
It will help provide the energy to pump the brine from beneath the desert.
Ganfeng teams on the ground will have to overcome myriad difficulties, including finding translators who understand lithium as well as Chinese.
Only one other lithium company operates in the area, Australia-listed Orocobre.
“In this little puna [plateau] at 4,000 metres we’re going to have over 1,000 workers between the solar project and Cauchari and Orocobre,” says John Kanellitsas, a former investment banker who is executive vice-chairman of New York-listed Lithium Americas, which is developing the project in Argentina with Ganfeng.
Across the Andes in Chile, Ganfeng’s rival Tianqi has been expanding its presence, led by Vivian Wu, a 45-year-old former English teacher who previously worked for Nokia. Last year Tianqi spent $4.1bn for a  24 per cent stake in SQM, gaining three seats on its board.
The deal was fiercely opposed by the company’s largest shareholder Julio Ponce Lerou, Pinochet’s former son-in-law, who  lost control over the company last year.
He said it would give Tianqi sensitive information about a rival.
Mr Ponce Lerou filed a lawsuit to block the deal, but it was dismissed in October by Chile’s antitrust court.
Tianqi’s founder Jiang Weiping got his first big break after he managed to buy a state-owned lithium plant in Sichuan in 2004 for Rmb11m （$1.6m at today’s exchange rate）.
Mr Jiang had been supplying the plant with lithium from Australia.
The local government suggested he take it over to resolve their debts, as it was close to bankruptcy, according to Ms Wu.
Today the plant produces around 17,000 tonnes a year of lithium.
Mr Jiang’s second break came in 2012 when he won a bidding battle against Rockwood for control of the world’s largest lithium facility, the Greenbushes mine, which had been in operation since the days of Australia’s gold rush in 1888.
It was like “a snake eating an elephant”, according to one Tianqi employee.
To win the deal Tianqi started to buy up shares of the Canadian-listed company that owned the mine, Talison Lithium.
Then, once it had breached the 10 per cent threshold for disclosure, Mr Jiang offered a price for Talison that was a 15 per cent premium to Rockwood’s offer, backed by financing from China’s sovereign wealth fund.
Tianqi had faced the risk of losing its key supplier if it had not bought Greenbushes, according to Ms Wu, who joined Tianqi in 2009.
“We knew it was something we had have to grow in a sustainable way.”
Tianqi’s deal for SQM has surprised analysts and investors, however, since it does not give the company a majority stake or control over SQM and has left the company heavily in debt.
Tianqi cannot appoint any of its own employees as directors, as part of an agreement with Chile’s antitrust regulators.
But Joe Lowry, a lithium consultant who worked for FMC in Asia in the early 2000s, argues that Tianqi is waiting for the day when Mr Ponce Lerou may be willing to sell.
That could give Tianqi a stronger foothold in one of the lowest cost lithium producers, just as sales of electric cars become mainstream.
Chinese companies will become the “stewards of the overall lithium market”, according to Mr Jaffe. “Their goal is not to be Chinese players but to be global players.”
The rapid spending by Chinese companies has prompted some of the Big Three producers into action.
In November Albemarle agreed to pay $1.15bn for a 50 per cent share in the Wodgina lithium project in Western Australia.
Paul Graves, a former Goldman Sachs banker who runs Livent, told the FT in March that he was also keen to acquire more lithium resources in Argentina and Australia.
Livent is one of the key suppliers of lithium hydroxide, the type used by Tesla, from its Salar del Hombre Muerto project in Argentina.
“If you look at the money that’s gone into lithium over the past few years, it is well over 50 per cent Chinese,” Mr Lowry says. “But that was open to everybody, this wasn’t a rigged game. The Big Three as a collective group were too set in their ways. China is investing ahead of the curve.”
In Xinyu, Ganfeng has plans to move up the value chain into battery production.
At another plant nearby, robots silently assemble sheets of battery materials to be made into lithium-iron phosphate batteries, the technology used by China’s electric buses, which are part of the world’s largest fleet.
And a 40-minute drive away in Yichun workers handle highly reactive rectangles of solid lithium metal using gloves inserted into an airtight container full of argon.
Ganfeng is the world’s largest producer of pure lithium metal, a product that is set to play a key role in solid-state batteries.
These next-generation batteries promise to store significantly more energy for the same weight than current batteries, helping cars to drive as far as their petrol-powered counterparts on one charge.
Ganfeng is currently testing solid electrolyte batteries for the drone industry but aims to make its own solid-state lithium metal batteries for electric cars.
Mr Wang, who has just returned from a meeting with Argentine president Mauricio Macri, says he is still keen on more lithium acquisitions.
“But we don’t want to spend too much money too early,” he adds.

The Trump administration has proposed punitive duties on countries that artificially lower their currencies — a sweeping trade policy tool that could be used against US allies as well as adversaries like China.
On Thursday evening, the US Department of Commerce issued a notice of “proposed rulemaking” that would allow the government to slap penalties on countries that “act to undervalue their currency relative to the dollar, resulting in a subsidy to their exports”.
Previous US administrations have been wary of mixing trade and currency, but political pressure from Congress to include currency as a factor in trade discussions has been growing.
“Foreign nations would no longer be able to use currency policies to the disadvantage of American workers and businesses,” said Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary. “This proposed rulemaking is a step toward implementing President Trump’s campaign promise to address unfair currency practices by our trading partners.”
Over the years US lawmakers have accused China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam of artificially lowering their currencies — but broad new rules could entangle other countries, including in Europe.
One concern with such provisions has always been that if applied with reciprocity, currency provisions could constrain the Federal Reserve, or undermine its independence.
Another is that it could invite legal challenges at the World Trade Organization.
Yet another is that there is no agreed upon method to measuring undervaluations.
In any case, some analysts say such a US step could be hugely destabilising to the world economic order at a time when it is already under strain.
“Were this to happen, it would be a highly significant and corrosive development and a major black eye for the US and the international monetary system,” said Mark Sobel, a former senior US Treasury official.
The move follows a pattern in which Mr Trump has sought to inject measures to prevent  currency devaluations into trade deals. The agreement struck last year with Canada and Mexico to revamp Nafta included a currency provision, while the US and China were considering currency measures during their faltering negotiations to end their trade dispute.
The timing of the announcement seemed designed to send a warning to China that the US would not tolerate any moves by Beijing to offset the impact of escalating tariffs on its imports by artificially lowering the value of the renminbi. However, it could also raise eyebrows in Japan ahead of Mr Trump’s visit to Tokyo over the weekend, and in South Korea, where the US president is also due to go in late June.
The imposition of punitive trade measures based on currency policy would be remarkable because countervailing duties are normally used to combat unfair subsidies by America’s trading partners.
Industries that have used those trade remedies in the past, and criticised countries for lowering their currency artificially, welcomed the US move.
“Today’s announcement by Secretary Ross is a significant step by the Trump Administration to help triage the massive damage that undervalued currency is causing to our nation’s manufacturing sector, especially the steel industry,” the American Iron and Steel Institute said in a statement.

A usually competent co-worker is struggling to write a difficult — but not impossible — report.
Despite clear instructions and deadlines, he has not even started, and his delays and excuses are holding up the rest of the team.
The most obvious — and seemingly sensible — course of action would be to offer instruction.
A likely reason for his procrastination is lack of knowledge: he simply does not have the information or skills to write a report: gathering facts, turning notes into prose and so on.
The least-sensible move, surely, would be to ask him to be a mentor to a junior.
Counterintuitive options are sometimes the best.
A study by behavioural scientists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business suggests that the act of mentoring may in some circumstances be the secret to cracking procrastination.
In fact, evidence emerging from business schools suggests mentoring has all kinds of hidden benefits.
But things can go wrong.
Other — seemingly conflicting — research found mentoring can be a hindrance rather than a help to staff progression.
It all depends on the circumstances.
According to the Chicago Booth study, what our dithering co-worker really needs — and what will finally set him to work — is to recover his confidence.
The best way is to ask him to advise someone else.
In other words, those who lack motivation may need to give advice rather than receive it.
“The first question to ask is, why is the person not doing something?” says Professor Ayelet Fishbach, co-author of the research. “Is it because she doesn’t know how? Sometimes, but often there is another explanation: the task is too overwhelming and they have lost confidence.”
That is where the hidden power of mentoring comes in.
Procrastinators often make great mentors, says Prof Fishbach, because they know more than they think.
“They don’t realise how much they have learnt from struggling.”
The value for employers is doubled: being asked to give advice gives the ditherer the confidence that was missing in the first place — to get on with the task at hand.
Chicago Booth’s findings come at the same time as research from Cambridge Judge Business school, where behavioural scientists found that the act of advising junior colleagues can reduce anxiety and improve the mental health of mentors — particularly those in high-pressure jobs.
That study, in the Journal of Vocational Behaviour, focused on policing, because it requires mental strength in challenging situations combined with pressure to be efficient.
But it holds lessons for anyone in a frantic job.
Despite the pressures of police roles — including threats, abuse, snap decisions and the risk of death — officers tend not to seek support from other officers, particularly senior ones, fearing a stigma associated with mental health disorders.
Mentoring, the researchers found, can help fill that void: “This could help organisations address the serious and costly workplace issues of anxiety and mental health,” says co-author Thomas Roulet.
Mentoring is a powerful and relatively inexpensive way for employers to coach and nurture junior staff who need help to plan their career and make their mark.
Now we know it also builds confidence and mental resilience in the mentors themselves.
Done well, it can be life-changing.
But is that always the case — and what do the new findings mean for executives trying to build the best mentoring schemes?
According to Kathy Kram, professor of management at Boston University Questrom School of Business and a leading authority on mentoring, managers should plan carefully, because dispensing advice is not always a good idea.
It can even be a hindrance.
“Sometimes mentors give advice when it would be more helpful for the mentee to be asked thought-provoking questions,” she says.
Those could be leading questions that help the mentee think deeply about their problems and hit upon their own solutions.
Secondly, says Prof Kram: “Mentees may comply with the advice given, but not necessarily learn about themselves, their unique qualities and how best to align their actions with their values.”
In fact, research suggests that advice-giving can even undermine learning and development if the recipient is not encouraged to examine their own beliefs, attitudes and patterns of behaviour in the process, says Prof Kram.
Next month, the FT will pair senior leaders with millennial executives for an audio series exploring how each generation approaches business, and the advice they offer one another.
A careful reading of the best of business school research will help inform the work, as it should every corporate mentoring programme.
Proceed with caution.

The Trump administration signalled that the trade war with China is likely to last through the summer, as it announ­ced a $16bn aid package for farmers to compensate them for losses due to the escalating tariff feud with Beijing.
The bailout marks the second multibillion-dollar move by the US president to help farmers in as many years, as he tries to contain the damage from retaliatory tariffs imposed by China, which have sharply reduced US exports to the Asian nation.
“While the farmers would rather have trade than aid, if they don’t have trade they need aid — that’s what it is,” Sonny Perdue, US agriculture secretary, said.
US officials said the payments would be made in three tranches, with the first in July or August.
Mr Perdue played down the chances of a deal to end the trade war before then, even with a meeting expected between Mr Trump and Xi Jinping, Chinese president, at the G20 leaders’ summit next month in Japan.
“While we would love a trade deal in that period of time . . . it’ll be very difficult to understand how a trade deal could be consummated prior to that first payment, or first tranche,” Mr Perdue said.
He added that the second disbursement, expected in November, and the third payment, expected in January 2020, would depend on the fate of the trade talks with Beijing.
The US and China were close to a deal earlier this month, but talks collapsed at the eleventh hour, leading Mr Trump to impose higher tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports and threaten more as early as late June, triggering retaliation plans from Beijing.
The addition of Huawei, the Chinese technology company, to a US export blacklist last week further damaged the prospects of a patch-up.
“The US . . . crackdown on Chinese companies not only seriously damages the normal commercial co-operation between both countries, but it also forms a great threat to the security of the global industrial and supply chain,” Gao Feng, a commerce ministry spokesman, said yesterday.
“China is firmly opposed to this. We will closely monitor developments and make adequate preparations.”
US officials said the package comprised direct payments to farmers worth $14.5bn, as well as $1.4bn in government purchases of agricultural goods to be distributed to food banks and poorer Americans, a larger bailout than the $12bn offered in 2018.
Mr Trump said earlier this month that he wanted to direct farm purchases to poor countries as food aid in the package, but that option was discar­ded.
“Certainly that was contemplated initially. When President Trump learned of the inefficiency and the logistics challenges of distribution worldwide, as well as the potential for market disruption in many of these countries, he . . . wanted the revenue to go into American producers’ pockets, where the challenge is,” Mr Perdue said.
The US agriculture department did not disclose details on eligibility and rates of payment for different products, saying they would be “released at a later date”.
However, it did say that producers of everything from barley and canola to corn and soyabeans would benefit.
“We thank President Trump for recognising that our patriot farmers have borne the brunt of China’s trade retaliation,” said David Herring, a producer from North Carolina and president of the National Pork Producers Council.

Donald Trump said that Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications network company, was “very dangerous” but could still be “included” in a trade deal with Beijing, as the US president announced a $16bn bailout package for farmers hit by escalating tariffs.
Speaking at the White House on Thursday as financial markets suffered a new day of losses stemming from trade tensions with China, Mr Trump said there remained a “good possibility” that the negotiations with Beijing could get back on track.
After talks with China broke down earlier this month, Mr Trump moved quickly to slap new tariffs on Chinese imports, but also opened another front in the economic conflict by placing Huawei — one of China’s leading global technology companies — on an export blacklist run by the US commerce department.
Although US officials have frequently insisted that the crackdown on Huawei is a national security issue, rather than a trade issue, Mr Trump has in the past suggested the dispute over the company could be resolved in a trade agreement with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Mr Trump said Huawei was “very dangerous, from a security standpoint”, but insisted that it was “possible that Huawei could be included as part of a trade deal”.
His comments at this stage in the dispute could raise hopes that the US was prepared to reverse its hardline stance against the company, at least in part, or may simply be interpreted as an attempt to reassure jittery investors.

As Washington and Beijing fight a trade war, America’s biggest meat producer is eyeing a back door into the Chinese market that will allow it to dodge high tariffs on US agricultural goods.
Tyson Foods is in talks over a multi­billion-dollar investment in Kazakhstan beef production as part of the Kazakh government’s push to attract investors by selling itself as an agricultural powerhouse on China’s border.
The US is the world’s biggest beef producer, but sales to China have been hit since Beijing imposed a 25 per cent retaliatory tariff in July, bringing the total levy to 37 per cent.
The value of US beef exports to China fell 17 per cent year on year in the first quarter.
Three people with knowledge of the discussions said that Tyson was in negotiations to set up a beef processing plant in Kazakhstan, which exports meat to China under a 12 per cent tariff.
It has discussed an initial investment of about $200m in the plant, one person said.
It would form part of a potential total investment that could run into several billion dollars, with ambitions to scale up production to 5m tonnes a year.
The US is expected to produce 12.4m tonnes of beef this year, versus 480,000 tonnes in Kazakhstan, according to US government data.
Tyson told the Financial Times that it was “not unusual for us to consider various international opportunities” as part of the company’s efforts to expand globally.
“We have visited Kazakhstan and have interest in the nation’s future food production efforts. However, we have not formalised plans for a project there.”
The Arkansas-based company generated $4.8bn — or 12 per cent — of its sales last year outside the US, and executives have prioritised expansion in international markets.
China’s demand for foreign pork, beef, chicken and fish meat is forecast to shoot higher as African swine fever removes as many as 200m animals from its pig herd, the world’s largest.
“We are seeing increased shipments, not only from the US but other parts of the world, to fill that gap,” said Noel White, Tyson’s chief executive.
Any investment from Tyson would be a boost to Kazakhstan’s efforts to upgrade its agriculture industry, which is large and well located between consumers China, India and Europe but inefficient and underfunded.

Theresa May will today set out plans to quit Number 10, after a dramatic day at Westminster when senior cabinet ministers led by foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt finally killed the UK prime minister’s hopes of securing a Brexit deal.
Mrs May, her premiership crippled by a cabinet revolt, a parliamentary mutiny and a furious voter backlash over Brexit, will set out her plans for her departure at a meeting with senior Conservative Sir Graham Brady, shop steward of the party’s MPs.
Conservative MPs believe Mrs May could announce plans to quit as Tory leader on June 10, enabling her to receive Donald Trump on a state visit on June 3-5.
Mrs May last night discussed the choreography of her departure with her husband Philip at their Berkshire home; those inside the Number 10 spoke of a premier in a “fragile state” as her time in office draws to a close.
Although Mrs May is expected by cabinet ministers to continue as caretaker prime minister until a new Tory leader is appointed — possibly in July — Downing Street declined to confirm she would stay on in an interim capacity.
David Lidington, her de facto deputy, has been tipped as a possible stand-in prime minister, but is not expecting to be pressed into duty.
The Queen was said by Buckingham Palace to have no planned engagements today.
Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a member of the backbench Tory 1922 executive, said: “I want her to give a timetable for when she will go. Maybe she will still quit tomorrow.”
The embattled prime minister was told by Mr Hunt yesterday to drop her new withdrawal agreement bill, amid growing anger on the Conservative benches over its inclusion of the prospect of a second referendum.
At the end a brutal week in Westminster, Jeremy Hunt told Mrs May in a meeting that it was “not fair” to ask MPs to walk through the voting lobbies in the full knowledge the bill would be defeated.
Home secretary Sajid Javid demanded Mrs May remove the offer of granting the House of Commons a vote on whether to hold another referendum, during another “frank” meeting.
Earlier in the day, Downing Street insisted the legislation would be published today and put to a vote in the first week of June; by midday that plan had been abandoned and the bill was put into the deep freeze.
Neither minister explicitly called for her to go — but without the backing of her cabinet Mrs May is likely to conclude she cannot bring forward the legislation.
Andrea Leadsom, Leader of the Commons, had already quit the cabinet.
Downing Street admitted Mrs May was “listening to colleagues” concerns, but some senior Tories admitted it would be pointless trying to rewrite the unloved deal now.
“It’s dead,” said one.
Mrs May will return to London this morning to meet with Sir Graham.
The meeting will come in the aftermath of voting in European Parliament elections, with opinion polls suggesting the Conservatives could poll below 10 per cent — the party’s worst ever performance in a national election.

Theresa May has announced her resignation as Conservative leader, clearing the stage for a new prime minister to pick up the formidable challenge of delivering Brexit and reuniting a shattered party.
Mrs May said in a statement in Downing Street that she would resign as Tory leader on Friday June 7, triggering a leadership contest the following week which former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is favourite to win.
The prime minister said she would continue in a caretaker role until a new Conservative leader is elected; that process — involving Tory MPs and party activists — is expected to be wrapped up before the end of July.
Mrs May finally yielded to the inevitable in a statement in Downing Street on Friday morning, following a meeting with Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench Tory 1922 committee.
Sir Graham had made it clear that Mrs May stood no chance of winning parliamentary backing for her revamped Brexit deal and that she had lost the confidence of her party.
Senior cabinet ministers, led by foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, on Thursday told Mrs May that they could not support her revised Brexit deal, which held open the possibility of a second EU referendum.

A decade ago, the corporate landscape was filled with rock star chief executives, men （they were overwhelmingly male） who inhabited such a rarefied position that they could not easily be challenged by underlings.
No longer.
Last week Strategy&, the consulting arm of PwC, released its latest survey on CEOs.
It showed that the rate of turnover at the top of the world’s largest 2,500 companies reached 17.5 per cent last year, the highest since the survey started in 2000.
The good news for CEOs was that three quarters of these departures were internally planned, and only about a fifth were “involuntary” — ie firings.
This ratio was little changed from earlier years.
But the bad news （or goodish, depending on your perspective） was that the trigger for ejections has changed.
A decade ago, half of all expulsions were triggered by poor financial performance, and less than a tenth by “ethical lapses”, PwC says.
In 2018, however, 39 per cent of departures were due to ethical issues, such as “fraud, bribery, insider trading, environmental disasters, inflated resumes, and sexual indiscretions”, while bad financial performance only accounted for 35 per cent. Yes, you read that right: it is now ethics, not financial metrics, that are most likely to cause a top executive to be fired. （And this tally does not include those who were jumped before they were pushed.）
Why?
PwC analysts see little tangible proof that today’s CEOs are actually behaving less ethically than their predecessors.
Instead, they blame a factor that never used to be discussed much at business schools: culture, or a shift in standards and expectations.
It is hard to disagree.
And I would add that technology is central to this culture change.
Consider the #MeToo movement, the campaign against sexual harassment that exploded in the autumn of 2017 and created an environment that contributed to the removal of CEOs at some of the world’s largest companies.
Rumours about sexual harassment have long circulated in companies.
However, they rarely cost a CEO his head before, since the victims could not easily share their experiences.
Now, however, social media is enabling these once-fragmented voices to unite at speed.
Equally importantly, peer-to-peer communication in cyber space is contributing to a shift in the pattern of trust.
It used to be taken for granted that the voice of the CEO carried more authority than lowly employees.
However, Rachel Botsman, a professor of management studies, says we now live in a world of “distributed trust”, where more faith is being placed in the wisdom of online networked crowds than people running institutions.
A survey by Edelman public relations group underscores this: in 2018 only 47 per cent and 44 per cent of people said they respectively trusted a CEO or corporate board for advice.
However, 61 per cent and 53 per cent trusted “a person like me” and a “regular employee”.
“Horizontal” trust is rising faster than the “vertical” sort.
This has produced a world where protests can snowball so quickly and unpredictably that it is hard for chief executives to fight back.
It is also raises pressure on boards, regulators and shareholders to scrutinise those CEOs — and swiftly remove perceived transgressors.
The #MeToo tally illustrates this.
But “this is not just about #MeToo”, as Martha Turner of PwC notes.
Cyber crowd protests are erupting over environmental and social issues too, driving an explosion in values-based shareholder activism.
Is this good for capitalism?
Some corporate leaders might say “no”, and complain that political correctness has gone too far.
A few, like Demos Parneros formerly at Barnes Noble , have even sued.
And their complaints sometimes have a point: trial by social media can be fickle and occasionally foolish.
“There is a presumption that you are guilty until proven innocent,” says Ms Turner.
But it is also true that there have been abuses of CEO power before, in relation to gender and much else.
So it is welcome that these are belatedly being challenged and corrected.
And it will be extremely hard to put this genie back into the bottle — unless the internet shuts down.
So for better or worse, CEOs and investors need to recognise that the world has changed.
“Corporate and Social Responsibility” is no longer a label that can be slapped on to a feel-good report or delegated to the human resources department.
In a cyber world, CSR can bite with a vengeance.
Just ask all those CEOs who were deemed unethical last year.

It might be a tulip. Or it might be a Q-tip. It’s clearly priapic. But however you describe it and whatever it is, it looks dangerously like a symptom of a country lacking seriousness about its cities.
The news this week that the City of London has granted planning permission for a Foster + Partners-designed 305m-tall glass viewing pod on a concrete shaft might have been taken for an April Fool’s gag, except it came a day too late. The back-story is that the owner, the J Safra Group, and the architect of the Gherkin, were peeved that their bullet-shaped tower — arguably the building that kicked off the reimagination of the London skyline — had been obscured by bigger neighbouring towers. It is an attempt to reassert that original Gherkin brand on a cityscape that has changed beyond all recognition since 2004, the date when the Swiss Re Tower （as nobody has ever called it） was completed.
The original argument for the City tower “cluster” was that London’s traditional financial centre needed modern office space to compete with the emerging financial hub to its east in Canary Wharf — and globally.
It was to be the symbol of a rejuvenated City.
The Tulip marks the advent of something else: the transformation of the Cit y into a funfair and its skyline into a resource to be consumed by tourists.
It represents a transformation from a place built to fulfil a commercial need into a spectacle.
This is a dangerous trend, of which the Tulip is only the latest and most visible manifestation. It has swept London, leaving a legacy of financial waste and white elephants that makes the city’s administration look vain, gullible and incompetent. The biggest of them, the Garden Bridge, did not happen. Not a single hole was dug. Yet this extravagant and uncalled for stunt cost the public purse £53m. The Emirates Air Line, a cable car in a desolate Docklands setting （dubbed the Dangleway） is a little-used vanity project, which was, like the Garden Bridge, promoted by then mayor Boris Johnson. He was also responsible for the hideous helter skelter of Anish Kapoor’s ArcelorMittal Orbit, a building designed by an artist which manages to be neither architecture nor art. And then there is the Coca-Cola London Eye, a structure which has spawned global imitators. Its commercialised base has despoiled London’s South Bank and the area around its one-time city hall, sold off to become a hotel and theme park.
A viewing tower, a cable-car ride, a slide and a Ferris wheel. These are not the elements of a serious city but the markers of a fairground, a place for pure entertainment, noisy, brash and temporary. London, a city that once inspired with its architecture, from pioneering social housing and board schools to garden suburbs, stations, underground railways and squares, is now looking to the instant cities of the Gulf and Asia for inspiration. These centres have attempted to build themselves as brands by treating their skylines as corporate logos. Danish urbanist Jan Gehl has described their trophies as “perfume bottle architecture”.
London does not need a new identity, it already has one.
Its Roman and Medieval street plan is infinitely rich and complex, an archaeology and history lasting two millennia.
The capital has clearly demonstrated that it can do modern architecture as well as any city.
But it is not alone in its delusions.
The designer of the ill-starred Garden Bridge, Thomas Heatherwick, is the author of the much-maligned （and much photographed） Vessel in New York.
The set of metallic interlocking stairs in the $25bn Hudson Yards development has been adopted as the corporate logo for developers Related.
Like the Tulip, it has been subject to a series of less-than-flattering nicknames from the Shawarma to the Wastebasket.
It has become a frame for selfies.
These are not monuments that seek to commemorate collective events and neither do they contribute to the public good.
If they are ticketed （as the Vessel is and the Tulip would be） they cannot claim to be public spaces.
They are corporate branding, pure and simple.
It is also, incidentally, bad architecture.
Buildings that swell as they rise look weird — just look at 20 Fenchurch Street, known as the Walkie Talkie: its big head muscles its neighbours out of the way; a bully building.
The Tulip does something similar, if slimmer.
There is no pretension to a collective aesthetic, only a look-at-me arrogance.
It’s true that the Empire State Building is said to make more from its viewing platforms than it ever did from rent.
But the building is an integral part of the Manhattan skyline, a functional building with a beautiful base, integrated perfectly into its street grid.
There is nothing new in cities celebrating themselves, but the line between admiration and masturbation can be blurred.
We should be wary of selling our skylines to the highest bidder.
They are the property of us all.

When Narendra Modi led his Bharatiya Janata party to a sweeping victory in India’s 2014 election, it was seen by many as an exceptional, one-off event, stemming from anger at the incumbent Congress party over economic instability and corruption.
But after his landslide re-election win yesterday, it is clear that his latest victory is the harbinger of a fundamental change — nothing less than the reordering of India’s political landscape.
The BJP, the political arm of a century-old ethno-nationalist movement, has emerged as the principal political force, supplanting Congress, which led the anti-colonial fight and dominated public life for decades after independence.
The BJP’s back-to-back wins are the first time any party other than Congress has secured two consecutive, single-party majorities in parliament.
“This is essentially the wholesale replacement of Congress dominance by BJP dominance,” said Kanchan Chandra, a politics professor at New York University.
The verdict is a powerful affirmation of public faith in Mr Modi, a tea-seller’s son who depicts himself as the nation’s watchman and who has captivated Indians with his vow of asceticism, frenetic energy and efforts to improve their material and economic prospects.
“Getting a single-party majority in 2019 is even more significant than getting it in 2014,” said Sadanand Dhume, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “In 2104, you could attribute it to the unpopularity of the [former prime minister] Manmohan Singh regime. In 2019, you can only attribute it to the popularity of Mr Modi.”
Through the adroit use of social media, including his own Narendra Modi “app”, a monthly national radio address and leaning on mainstream media outlets and other critics, Mr Modi has maintained his image as hardworking, well-intentioned and incorruptible.
He is seen as working tirelessly to modernise India and elevate its global standing as he travels the world bear-hugging international leaders.
“Here, we have a single political lea­der who exudes total dominance, the likes of which we haven’t seen since Indira Gandhi, in terms of being able to saturate the political space and sustain a heightened level of popularity,” said Milan Vaishnav, South Asia programme director at the Carnegie End­ow­ment for International Peace.
But the BJP sweep also appears to mark the ascendance of an idea of India fundamentally at odds with the vision laid out by anti-colonial leader Mahatma Gandhi and his political heir, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first post-independence premier. They believed India’s interests were best secured by a secular state, governing a religiously and linguistically diverse society whose members had  equal claim as citizens.
But Mr Modi, BJP president Amit Shah and other party leaders are longstanding activists of the rightwing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, founded in 1925 and based on the belief India should primarily be a Hindu nation, where the rights of the maj­ority should trump those of Muslims and Christians, seen as al­ien religions that pose existential threats to Hindu society.
“Under Nehru, In­d­ia was never a home­land for India’s Hindus specifically, it was a homeland for everybody,” said Ms Chandra. “Now, you have ess­entially a new version of nat­ionalism. It’s very clearly a Hindu nat­ionalist idea and this idea now has mass roots.”
Such ideas were played down in Mr Modi’s first prime ministerial campaign, as he focused on economic aspirations and tapped public anger over corruption.
But the idea of India as primarily a Hindu nation has now come to the fore more expli­citly, particularly in the BJP’s virulent social media campaign, which was awash with anti-Muslim rhetoric.
The question now is how Mr Modi will utilise his renewed and strengthened mandate at a time when people are looking to him to deliver on his original promises of more jobs and economic opportunity.
“We are in completely uncharted territory,” said Mr Dhume. “We have no idea what a resurgent Hindu nationalist, with a second single party majority, will choose to do with that kind of untrammelled power.”
India is facing serious economic challenges, including slowing growth, a persistently high fiscal deficit, tepid private investment and weakness and instability in the financial system.
Mr Modi has yet to articulate any plans for a further round of major reforms, such as selling unprofitable state enterprises, relaxing restrictive labour laws, modernising the land market or tackling the state-dominated banking system.
He is initially expected to tinker, further refining the tax system, and the bankruptcy court, which may not be sufficient to unlock India’s growth potential.
“This is one of the biggest downside risks of the BJP return,” said Mr Vaishnav. “There is really nobody of cabinet rank who serves as an economic reform compass for the government. To date, they have not been willing to bring somebody on who could perform that role for them for fear of creating an alternative power centre.”
But Mr Modi is also likely to face mounting pressure from his core supporters to act on some of the right wing’s political priorities, which could prove a polarising distraction.
Mr Shah has already promised to start a national register of citizens, a potential tool for disenfranchising millions of Muslims.
There may also be a move to try to amend the constitution to end the special status of the Muslim-majority Kashmir region so that people from across India can buy property and settle there.
“The very narrative of the republic . . . has been rewritten and reclamation will be difficult,” said Kapil Komireddi, author of Malevolent Republic, a book on India’s shifting political culture. “There was a time in this country where to be a Hindu nationalist, or RSS member, was stigmatised. Now there is stigma attached to being secular,” he added.
“If you are a secularist, you are an apologist for the crimes of the Muslim invaders and the trauma of partition.”

At a rally in central Pennsylvania on Monday, Donald Trump had an easy answer for US businesses fretting over the breakdown in trade talks with China and the escalation in levies on thousands of products coming across the Pacific Ocean.
“Anyone who doesn’t want to pay the tariffs has a simple solution: build your product in America, bring your factories back to Pennsylvania, where you want to be anyway,” the US president said.
Mr Trump has ramped up his calls for American companies to ditch China and bring manufacturing back to the US as the prospects of a deal with Xi Jinping, Chinese president, dimmed in recent weeks.
But many US businesses know that rapidly unravelling their China ties is not as simple as the White House thinks.
“When we hear the suggestion that we should source our product in the US, or somewhere else overseas, as if you can flip the switch and do that, we all kind of cringe,” said Matt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a lobbying group for shoe companies.
US companies have gradually reduced their dependence on Chinese imports in recent years as production costs, from labour to transportation, have increased compared with neighbouring Asian countries.
American footwear businesses used to bring in more than 90 per cent of their products from China a decade ago, but that has decreased to 69 per cent.
But they are now being forced to contemplate a much more abrupt change to avoid bearing the brunt of massive tariffs that would force them to raise prices for consumers, or, in the worst case, slash employment.
“There’s a reason we are in China today, that’s because of the vast amount of labour available in China, and the fact that all the raw material suppliers and support functions today are residing in China,” said Mike Jeppesen, president of global operations at Wolverine Worldwide, a Michigan-based footwear business. Forty per cent of his company’s imports come from China.
In congressional testimony on Wednesday, Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, insisted that industry fears were overblown and he had just spoken to Wal-Mart about the impact of the tariffs. “A lot of this business will be moved from China to other places in the region so there will not be a cost,” Mr Mnuchin said, adding that some products would benefit from exemptions from the levies.
At the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, based in Guangzhou, Harley Seyedin, the organisation’s president, said the trade war is convincing executives to hasten decisions that had been in the works for some time.
“Now people know they really cannot put all their eggs in one basket,” said Mr Seyedin.
In recent days several companies — including Ralph Lauren and Xcel Brands, which owns consumer brands including Isaac Mizrahi and Judith Ripka — have said in earnings announcements and annual meetings that they have initiated or stepped up plans to move their supply chains.
Bronwyn Flores, a policy communications specialist at the Consumer Technology Association, whose members are electronics importers, said finding alternatives to China was now a “reality” but also “very complicated and very costly”.
Companies have spent years building up good relationships with suppliers, said Ms Flores.
“They have to go hire and train maybe 1,000 new people in an area that has never produced headphones before and they want their product to be one of the best in the market.”
Small businesses in particular might struggle to make quick changes because they “rely on the certainty that comes with entering multiyear contracts”, warned Nydia Velázquez, Democratic chairwoman of the House of Representatives’ small business committee.
Even an agreement between Mr Trump and Mr Xi may not be reassuring enough for US businesses to continue sourcing substantial volumes of goods from China.
“A deal will have enforcement contingencies and one of the big things that’s changed over the past 18 months is that companies now understand that the threat of tariffs may not be just a threat, it may be real — they can be taken off, but they can also be put right back on,” said Susan Lund of the McKinsey Global Institute.
A survey of its clients by trade data company Panjiva found that 50 per cent had already planned to shift production out of China before the tariffs, and that share rose to 82 per cent after the levies were implemented.
Joshua Green, Panjiva’s founder, said: “People recognised they were dependent on China, were nervous about it, and tried to find alternatives, but they found that to the extent that they could, it was about shifting some of what they were doing to other countries. Picking up everything you were doing in China and moving it elsewhere just wasn’t realistic.”
Mr Seyedin stressed that while US companies will rely less on imported products from China, they are still expanding in China to sell into the growing domestic market.
“The reality is that our companies are continuing to operate in China successfully, they continue to make profits, substantial profits, they have to continue operating in China to maintain and capture additional market share,” he said.
As for reshoring back to America, Mr Priest said Mr Trump’s vision was simply a “pipe dream” in his sector, where more than 2bn pairs of shoes are imported from China every year.
“The [US] capacity is gone, the skilled workforce that is needed for footwear production is only housed in a couple of enclaves,” said Mr Priest.
US labour costs and the challenge of selling US-made shoes through chains such as Wal-Mart or Target made it simply too difficult, Mr Priest added.
“You can’t have a $300 shoe that would normally be $120, with Americans willing to pay that price.”

Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have a vice-like grip on advising top technology companies.
But after Uber and Lyft’s weak initial public offerings, rival banks are hoping for some market disruption.
“The quality of deal execution is being called into question more, by both corporates and VCs [venture capital firms],” said David Hermer, head of equity capital markets at Credit Suisse, noting that a “small number of banks have a disproportionate share of leadership roles in technology IPO”.
Prized as much for the reputational halo it offers as for the hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in big mandates, the business of taking tech companies public has been highly concentrated since the 2000 dotcom crash, when many banks withdrew from the battered sector.
Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan earned 55 per cent of the $400m-plus fees generated by US tech IPOs last year, triple the bounty of the next three highest paid banks, according to data provider Refinitiv.
The trio have held the top three places since 2011 with a share that is far larger than the 38 per cent of fees they command in the broader $1.9bn-a-year US IPO fee pool.
The recent post-IPO share price falls for Lyft and Uber offer hope to rivals as they set out their stall to companies such as Airbnb and WeWork that are considering flotations.
History suggests the upstarts face an uphill battle.
To dislodge the top three, challengers such as Credit Suisse, Bank of America, Citigroup, Barclays and Deutsche Bank are pitted against some of the most well-connected bankers in Silicon Valley.
“When you’re a tech entrepreneur and you’re taking your company public, introducing new risk into the equation is not something you’re jumping to do,” said Howard Lerman, chief executive and co-founder of Yext, an enterprise software company. “By going with a tried and true [adviser], you are not going to do something crazy.”
Yext’s 2017 IPO was led by Morgan Stanley.
Mr Lerman said the longstanding relationship between the bank and his chief financial officer, Steve Cakebread, made it the obvious choice.
Mr Cakebread had worked with Morgan Stanley on the IPOs of Salesforce and Pandora when he was CFO of those companies.
“Between those three banks, they keep each other honest,” Mr Lerman said, referring to Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan.
The trio benefited as some rivals retrenched after the financial crisis; they also capitalised on demand for additional services from tech companies that were staying private for longer.
Private placements were particularly popular, such as the 2015 $1.6bn private placement that Goldman led for Uber.
It was a deal that was backed by Goldman’s own private wealth clients.
“We have been long-term players in this industry,” said Dan Dees, co-head of Goldman’s investment banking division. “We have committed resource. We have kept our people here. We have maintained the commitment to the business through the lean times.”
Goldman and Morgan Stanley bankers were roaming Silicon Valley in the 1990s when tech underwriting business was most associated with the “Four Horsemen” — boutique investment banks Alex Brown, Hambrecht & Quist, Robertson Stephens and Montgomery Securities — which have long since been taken over by bigger institutions.
Morgan Stanley alumni from that time include the noted venture capitalist Mary Meeker.
Goldman is also a prolific early investor in tech companies, with household names like Spotify and Uber as well as less well-known potential IPO candidates such as $2.65bn banking technology company Plaid.
Morgan Stanley was also on the pre-IPO roster for Spotify and numerous other unicorns, including cloud storage venture Dropbox, which listed for $9.2bn last year.
While rivals have come close to the top of league tables based on the volume of cash raised by clients, Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan earn the lion’s share of the fees.
Take Uber, where Morgan Stanley, Goldman and Bank of America will share more than $100m in underwriting fees.
Morgan Stanley, which led the IPO, will earn almost twice as much as Goldman and roughly four times BofA’s payout.
“There is never a dearth of additional voices that an issuer can tap if they choose to,” said Liz Myers, global head of equity capital markets at JPMorgan. “But they tend to rely on people and views at firms that have the longest record of doing deals in their space.”
In some ways JPMorgan is the successful challenger.
Since 2000 it has muscled in on what some bankers described as a cosy duopoly between Morgan Stanley and Goldman.
Its push has been partly fuelled by its ability to lend, using the biggest bank balance sheet in the US, and the provision of other services such as cash management and private banking.
Star bankers also reinforce the status quo.
Morgan Stanley has Michael Grimes, who led the charge on Uber as well as IPOs for Google, Facebook, Snap, Twitter and LinkedIn.
Goldman has Nick Giovanni — adviser to everyone from Expedia to Skype and Credit Karma — and Kim Posnett, who worked on Uber’s IPO.
JPMorgan has Noah Wintroub — whose big clients include Pinterest and Lyft — and Michael Millman, who has advised Dropbox and SurveyMonkey.
European rivals who once boasted star bankers have struggled to replace them.
That includes Imran Khan, the Credit Suisse banker who led Alibaba’s IPO, and Frank Quattrone, a leading Silicon Valley player who left Credit Suisse in 2003 during a criminal investigation and later founded investment venture Qatalyst.
Painful restructurings curbed European banks’ enthusiasm for investing in Silicon Valley.
“European firms, let's face it, they have been under a fair amount of latter-day challenges than the US [banks] that got their footing in the last five years,” said one Deutsche Bank banker. “There has been a little bit of distraction in investing in the business and turnover.”
The relatively small number of tech IPOs is another barrier to entry.
A senior banker at one of the big three said it would be difficult for other banks to make serious inroads while the volume of tech IPOs each year remains about 30 or 40, versus the 100-plus IPOs each year a few decades ago.
Rivals disagree.
Gary Kirkham, co-head of BofA’s global technology, media and telecoms investment banking group, said his bank’s deal backlog suggested that the tech IPO market had become a “four-horse race”.
“We’ve got something like 16 IPO transactions on the go right now,” he said.

“The sea inspires and drives me forwards every day,” says Dom Bridges, founder of the Margate-based natural skincare brand Haeckels.
He is carrying a bucket brimming with slippery looking seaweed — the fruits of his coastal harvest — and the smell of it hangs in the air.
“All our ingredients are sourced from this stretch of coastline. Our shop overlooks the sea. Our slogan ‘From the ocean, for the ocean’, is written on the windows of our store. This is where Haeckels began.”
The store — a tiny apothecary-style space bedecked in reclaimed oak panelling — opened in 2012, the year Bridges established the brand from his kitchen table. A beachcomber and volunteer warden, Bridges quit his job directing television ads for big skincare companies after becoming disillusioned with the way they were creating their ranges. His first product? A vegan bar of soap, made from Margate seaweed. “I wanted to bring craftsmanship and transparency to the table,” he says. “I wanted to create something that was an ambassador for this entire coastline.”
Haeckels is just one of a growing number of beauty brands with a focus on sustainable beauty.
Austin Austin Organic makes shampoos and conditioners in East Anglia, while New York-based Kahina Giving Beauty and UK fragrance brand Sana Jardin both source their materials fairly through women’s collectives in Morocco.
Former Calvin Klein creative director Francisco Costa recently launched Costa Brazil, which harvests its oils from the Amazon rainforest.
Make-up brands, meanwhile, are increasingly going vegan and producing paraben-free products. Intent on targeting a younger, digitally savvy and ethically switched-on audience, these brands market themselves as “clean beauty”. The moniker is catchy and millennial-friendly, but it also exempts labels from the more rigorous process required to bring organically certified products to market. The cynical might say clean beauty is a marketing trick. But there’s a wealth of contenders entering the space. And they are fulfilling a growing demand.
Milk Makeup, born out of the renowned photography hub Milk Studios and based in New York, offers lip balms, mascaras and eyebrow products all made from hemp oil.
The brand opened a neon-filled pop-up store in London’s Covent Garden last month: almost 5,000 teenagers queued to shop — and the wait-list for sold-out stock now numbers 17,000.
Meanwhile, the UK-based youth-centric brand Plenaire will soon launch with a range of blemish serums and hydrating masks in pretty pink formulas.
Founder Namrata Kamdar, who formerly worked in marketing for Coca-Cola and Pepsi, says the product range is free from petrochemicals, microbeads and silicones — and isn’t tested on animals.
These days, it’s cool to be conscious.
“Clean eating and veganism have been major drivers in bringing awareness and demand towards sustainable, natural beauty,” says Anita Kaushal, founder of Mauli Rituals, which takes its root from the Indian medicinal practice, Ayurveda. Maria Lam, managing director of Wildsmith Skin, which launched last April, agrees. “Consumers today think about where our things come from, our impact as a whole and our legacy — we have come of age,” she says.
Going natural has its benefits. “Organic ingredients have flourished without synthetic pesticides or artificial chemical fertilisers so the quality is not compromised,” says Sarah Murrell, co-founder of the London-based By Sarah, which uses ingredients certified by the Soil Association. “Certified organic products are up to 60 per cent higher in antioxidants,” claims Bessie Austin, who co-founded Austin Austin Organic with her father, Richard, last year.
Sustainable beauty is by no means a mass enterprise.
It takes four days to harvest the seeds from eight tonnes of fruit to obtain a litre of Kahina Giving Beauty’s Prickly Pear Seed Oil （$150）, while Sarah Craig, of the Canadian Penny Frances Apothecary, grows ingredients in her garden and makes her products in small batches at home.
“This is what makes my products special,” says Craig, of her potions such as her bestselling black cumin eye butter （$40）, which is so popular it garners a wait-list.
“The care. The time. The intimacy.”
Francisco Costa, meanwhile, has established links with non-profit Conservation International to source Costa Brazil’s trio of oils that he calls his “jungle complex”. “There is no other place I could have found these ingredients but the Amazon, the richest concentration of nature in the world,” says Costa. “During my time at Calvin Klein, we promoted healthy looking skin, letting it shine. But I became acutely aware of this cycle of creation and consumption in fashion and beauty. Creating a small-batch brand felt not so much of a decision but a necessity to improve the waste cycle,” he says. The brand’s aesthetic is minimalist, harking back to Costa’s days at Calvin Klein. “I wanted the packaging to feel like designed objects, and less disposable,” he says of the sculptural glass bottles that reference the buildings of Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer.
Shelf appeal is vital — almost all of these brands use dark glass recyclable bottles that not only better preserve the contents, but look stylish in the bathroom cabinet.
“I wanted to show that natural products can be as luxurious looking as any department store brand,” says Katharine L’Heureux, founder of Kahina Giving Beauty, of her packaging that blends “Moroccan handwriting with a decidedly New York aesthetic.”
A combination of tasteful aesthetics and careful ethics have drawn in style-conscious consumers and buyers alike.
In London, Austin Austin Organic is stocked at Alex Eagle, while Haeckels is available at End Clothing, Sana Jardin is stocked at Koibird, and Less — a purist three-product brand from Germany — is sold at Mouki Mou.
“As an independent shop, we have never been interested in anything mass-produced — quality and rarity are what we pursue,” says Maria Lemos, founder of Mouki Mou.
Clean beauty has got a big potential market.
Some 57 per cent of shoppers would buy — or boycott — a brand depending on its ethical values, according to Mintel — a figure up 20 per cent on the previous year.
And the interests of the brands are beginning to reach beyond the bathroom.
Bridges regularly hosts beach clear-ups of the Margate coastline, where volunteer combers get a free Haeckels body wash in return for collecting waste plastics: international fans can clean their local beaches and receive a 40 per cent discount online.
For Bridges it’s more than just a business. It’s a mission. “We aren’t jumping on a bandwagon, creating marketing or reacting to a TV show,” he says. “We’re a coastal-based skincare company. It is our absolute duty to protect it.”

It was an unnerving piece of data for investors last week, buried halfway down an esoteric spreadsheet released by the US government that tracks how many Treasuries foreign investors buy and sell.
China, the largest foreign creditor to the US government with total Treasury holdings in excess of $1.2tn, sold $20bn of securities with a maturity exceeding one year in March, according to US government data . The sales amounted to China’s largest retreat from the market in more than two years.
The move came shortly before tension over trade between Beijing and Washington heated up again with the US administration slapping additional tariffs on the country’s imports and Chinese officials retaliating with measures of their own.
What is more, the sales could not be explained away by the typical ebb and flow of China’s Treasury holdings that result from managing its large reserves to keep the currency stable.
The data reignited fears that Beijing may weaponise its holdings as part of the ongoing trade war, wreaking havoc with the biggest bond market in the world, pushing interest rates higher and increasing the US government’s cost of borrowing.
“If China starts dumping its Treasuries, it would cause huge financial instability,” said Mark Sobel, a former Treasury Department official who spent nearly four decades at the agency, adding that he considered this an unlikely scenario.
China’s holdings of Treasuries are inextricably linked to the country’s trade with the US.
China receives dollars in payment for its exports to America, and then needs to invest that money somewhere.
The Treasury market has long been China’s destination of choice because the market is not only big enough to host its enormous reserves but it also offers a better return than other super-safe investments.
Moreover, China avoids currency fluctuations that could come from selling those dollars to buy other assets.
As a result, China’s Treasury holdings typically dip if its reserves fall.
It has also sold Treasuries over the past year to support its beaten-down currency, as tariff talk has intensified.
On this occasion, though, neither of those forces appears to have been a factor.
To some analysts, it seems as though China simply decided to sell.
“One should take notice of a month of sales during a period when reserves appear to be stable by most indicators,” said Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and a former Treasury Department official. “It is certainly something that warrants attention.”
While concerns are mounting, investors and analysts are wary of jumping to conclusions .
Mr Setser cautioned that March’s data are a snapshot and not yet a trend.
Moreover, few see any alternative for China, other than remaining invested in Treasuries.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield is currently 2.42 per cent, well above the negative yields on equivalent German and Japanese sovereign bonds and still markedly higher than the 1.03 per cent offered on 10-year gilts in the UK.
Other markets are also much smaller than the US Treasury market, meaning they would struggle to digest any inflows from China’s massive holdings.
“Even it this were to be a threat, it’s a very non-credible one,” said Sonal Desai, chief investment officer for fixed income at Franklin Templeton in San Mateo, California. “What else [is China] going to buy?”
Meanwhile, there are few signs that recent bouts of selling by China have pushed US interest rates higher.
In the second half of 2011, China ramped up its sales of Treasuries but interest rates dropped too.
The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled from a peak of 3.74 per cent earlier in the year to 1.88 per cent by the year-end, amid a general bout of risk aversion caused by Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.
In 2016, China sought to prop up its currency and sold a net $160bn of long-term Treasuries with its holdings hitting the lowest since 2010 in November that year.
Ten-year rates did rise in the US — from 2.30 per cent to 2.44 per cent over the course of the year — but that seemed to be spurred primarily by the election of President Donald Trump, which brought renewed hopes of growth for the economy.
In March this year, during the latest round of selling, the 10-year Treasury yield slipped 30 basis points over the month to 2.41 per cent.
Still, few disagree that if China wanted to cause an upset in US rates by heavy selling of Treasuries, it probably could.
The catch is that it would lead to a revaluation of the country’s own US bonds as it sold.
“China selling its Treasury holdings is a nuclear option because it will hurt their own portfolio,” said Shawn Matthews, a former Cantor Fitzgerald trading head who launched his own hedge fund, Hondius Capital Management, last year.
“It depends on what the goal is,” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. “If the goal is to disturb the US Treasury market, then they may not care about inflicting self-harm.”

Federal Reserve rate-setters said in their latest meeting they aim to keep interest rates unchanged even if there’s an improvement in global conditions, as they stick doggedly to their “patient” approach to policy.
Minutes to the Fed’s most recent policy meeting, held on April 30 and May 1, showed that members of the central bank’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee expected policy to be held steady for some time to come after they kept the target range at 2.25-2.5 per cent.
Policymakers engaged in an extended debate over the composition of the central bank’s balance sheet in the longer term.
Many participants said they wanted increased scope to counter a future downturn by shifting from shorter-dated bond holdings to longer-term debt, in the hopes this would provide an extra boost in a future downturn.
The Fed is struggling to figure out why US inflation has remained stubbornly sluggish even as unemployment hovers at half-century lows and the economy approaches a record-long expansion.
While the central bank is hoping recent inflation shortfalls prove transitory, in the latest meeting a number of policymakers fretted that inflation expectations could get stuck below the Fed’s target if inflation does not start accelerating in the coming quarters.
The latest minutes suggest that the Fed has no immediate plans to move policy even though Mr Powell and many of his colleagues think the forces pulling down inflation should prove transient.
The “patient” approach will probably still be needed even if global economic and financial conditions improve, rate setters said during the latest meeting.
Since the gathering, trade prospects have if anything taken a turn for the worse, as the US and China prepare to ratchet up tariffs as tensions increase.
While “a few” Fed members thought there could be a case for further rate increases if the economy stays on course, the core members of the Federal Open Market Committee signalled they were not expecting to move policy for the time being.
The minutes did not record an explicit debate about cutting rates, but they noted: “several participants commented that if inflation did not show signs of moving up over coming quarters, there was a risk that inflation expectations could become anchored at levels below those consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 per cent objective”.
US markets remained relatively unmoved by the release of the minutes. The S&P 500 remained down quarter of a percentage point, the same level it was ahead of the statement. Treasuries rallied slightly, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury dropping fractions of a basis point to be down 3.5 basis points at 2.3909 per cent within 10 minutes of the release. The dollar index remained about 0.1 per cent lower at 98.014.

The head of the US Federal Aviation Administration raised the possibility that it could take months longer to certify the grounded Boeing 737 Max as safe to fly, as fractious global regulators gathered to discuss fixes to flight software implicated in two deadly crashes.
Speaking on the eve of a meeting of 30 international air regulators on Thursday, Daniel Elwell, the acting FAA chief, said the agency was still waiting for Boeing to submit a software update aimed at preventing air disasters such as those in Indonesia and Ethiopia which killed 346 people.
He told reporters the FAA has also not yet decided whether pilots will be required to undergo simulator training on the updated Max, a move that could substantially delay a return to service but which some global regulators may insist upon.
“If you said October I wouldn’t even say that, only because we haven’t finished determining exactly what the training requirements will be,” Mr Elwell said. “If it takes a year to find everything we need to give us the confidence to lift the [grounding] order so be it.”
Canada, Europe and Indonesia made clear ahead of the meeting that they would set their own conditions for determining when the plane is safe to fly again, threatening the FAA’s goal of building consensus for a co-ordinated plan to put the 737 Max back into action.

Europe’s aviation safety agency has set out strict conditions before it will allow Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft back into the skies, in a sign of the depth of the rift emerging among regulators after two deadly crashes.
EASA has told US regulator the Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing that it has three “pre-requisite conditions”, including demands that design changes for the plane be approved by the European agency, before it will lift the grounding of the Max.
Indonesia, site of the first accident last October when a Lion Air flight crashed into the sea, has also heaped pressure on the FAA by revealing that it was considering seeking a second assessment of the US regulator’s review of Boeing’s software update.
Yesterday Polana Pramesti, Indonesia’s director-general for air transport, said the country might ask EASA or Transport Canada for a second opinion.
In order for Indonesia to be comfortable with the Boeing 737 Max, she said, the company “has to fix not only the aircraft but also we need to increase the level of confidence [among] pilots and passengers”.
Ms Polana accused Boeing of being “arrogant”, and said the company was still not sharing sufficient information about the plane, pointing to training required for the Max as a cause for concern.
Based on conversations Ms Polana had with the company three weeks ago, Boeing still said that pilots only needed computer-based training for this type of aeroplane.
“But this is an aircraft. This is not an iPad,” she said, adding that updates on training requirements might be shared at a meeting of regulators in Texas today to review Boeing’s application to get the Max back in the air.
Her comments underline the depth of concerns over the FAA’s role in originally certifying the Max.
The agency has come under intense criticism in the wake of the two tragedies and for being the last regulator to ground the plane after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on March 10.
The FAA has been aiming to reassure fellow regulators at the Texas meeting about its process for allowing the Max to fly again, in the expectation that others will follow suit not too long afterwards.
US officials are keen to protect the present system by which regulators accept each others’ certification.
They argue that if each country insists on its own checks to new aircraft, it could double or treble the cost of a jet and add to the flying cost for passengers.
The European agency’s conditions are that any design changes by Boeing be EASA-approved and mandated, that an additional independent design review conducted by the agency be completed, and that Max flight crews “have been adequately trained”.
“We are working on having the 737 Max 8 return to service as soon as possible, but only once there is complete reassurance that it is safe,” a spokesman said.
Patrick Ky, EASA’s executive director, said in March that the agency would not allow the plane to resume service until it was satisfied, irrespective of what the FAA decided.

When Manchester City held off Liverpool to take the Premier League title on Sunday, it was a victory not only for City, but the league itself.
Liverpool had already gained their own win, qualifying for the Uefa Champions League final by beating Barcelona over a thrilling two-legged tie.
The Premier League has enjoyed a record-breaking 27th season, thanks to Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur joining Liverpool to monopolise both European club finals.
Leagues are group endeavours — an economist might say joint products — and the English league has beaten rivals in Spain, Germany, France and Italy.
But sports are peculiar markets, in which “pure monopoly is disaster”, as the US economist Walter Neale noted in 1964.
He meant that no team wants to eliminate all of its competitors because that would mean no matches to attract fans and no television rights to sell.
This warning also applies to national leagues in the age of global sports.
If a league is too strong, it provokes clubs that are excluded to seek alternatives. This is looming in Europe, with European club owners led by Andrea Agnelli, chairman of Italy’s Juventus, seeking to strengthen the Champions League at the expense of national ones such as the Premier League, La Liga in Spain and Germany’s Bundesliga.
The Premier League has cultivated a balance among its teams.
Rather than being dominated by one club, as Serie A in Italy is by Juventus and Ligue 1 in France by Paris Saint-Germain, it is led by a “big six”.
This includes Manchester City, which gained strength thanks to the deep pockets of its owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
It has done so partly by selling the rights to broadcasting matches collectively and sharing revenues more equally than top clubs would prefer. This contrasts with La Liga, which until 2015 let clubs negotiate such rights individually. According to Deloitte, average revenues for the Premier League big six were £415m in 2016-17, compared with £147m for the other 14 clubs.
The league also follows the European tradition, dating to shortly after the creation of the English Football League in 1888, of open leagues in which some teams are relegated and promoted each year.
That permits teams from below the chance to rise, as Leicester City did by gaining promotion in 2013-14 and winning the Premier League two years later.
Mr Agnelli, who chairs the European Club Association, wants to reinforce European competition, allowing leading clubs such as Juventus to spend more time （and garner higher revenues） playing each other, rather than lesser teams in their national leagues.
One idea is for the top teams to hold more secure places in the Champions League and play at least 14 games per season.
This would make the European soccer league more like US sports leagues, which are closed — the same teams compete each season without the risk of relegation, and the leagues only expand occasionally to new franchises.
That suits the incumbents by reinforcing their oligopoly and reducing the revenue volatility that European teams suffer by competing for places.
Along with other European leagues, the Premier League has protested at such a change, although it was founded in 1992 from a similar effort by English clubs to corner revenues.
Clubs at the top of Europe’s sporting pyramids are constantly tempted to form super leagues, and the temptation has grown as their audience has become global.
But there are dangers in teams exploiting their power aggressively.
One goes back to Neale’s warning against monopoly, or too narrow an oligopoly, in sports.
Formula 1, a closed league, suffers from being dominated by the Mercedes and Ferrari teams, which makes races less exciting.
（The Agnelli family also controls Ferrari.
Teams seek certainty but fans do not.
As one study put it, “the real intensity comes from identifying with an individual or team as they strive to win”, an experience in which “euphoria is always a possibility”.
It was the high likelihood that Liverpool could not overcome Barcelona’s lead from the first leg that made victory so sweet.
A second danger is distance.
The most resonant moment at Liverpool’s Anfield stadium came after the game when fans sang their anthem “You’ll Never Walk Alone” en masse, evoking the club’s history.
It is a fine balance for clubs to retain local identities, while making the most of their global reach; they lose part of what makes them so valuable if they disengage from their roots.
European football balances the two by combining national leagues with continental tournaments, but that can easily be upset.
Europe could be squeezed next by globalisation: Fifa, the sport’s world body, is expanding its Club World Cup into a pilot 24-team event from 2021.
Just as US baseball teams move cities, soccer teams could go mobile.
The way to avoid such traps is to ensure sufficient opportunity at home.
Other European leagues envy the Premier League its high revenues and global fame but the quality to which they should most aspire is its breadth at the top.
That is what makes it, and not merely its clubs, a winner.

Chinese regulators are preparing to open up trading of bond futures to domestic commercial banks as the government seeks to increase hedging tools and lure more foreign investors into the country’s $13tn bond market.
At present, brokerages and a few other types of buyers have been allowed in to the bond futures market but trading volumes are thin.
China’s securities regulator, the CSRC, is drafting changes to laws that would allow commercial banks to trade futures, moves that could be implemented by the end of this year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The push is part of a multiyear plan by Chinese regulators to broaden participation while opening up the market, the world’s third-largest, to foreign investors.
The upcoming rule change would not allow foreign investors to trade bond futures.
But the introduction of new hedging instruments for Chinese banks such as ICBC and CCB, which are by far the biggest investors in government bonds, is expected to boost liquidity and help with price discovery across the broader bond market.
That in turn could create more appealing conditions for foreign investors, who often complain of very patchy activity.
Analysts have projected that more than $100bn from foreign investors could flow into the Chinese market by early 2020 following the addition of government and policy bank bonds to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, a popular benchmark, in April.
Plans to open up the bond futures market in China have stagnated for years as policymakers have been reluctant to commit to measures that would expose the financial system to new kinds of risks.
Bond futures were first introduced in 1992.
But the market was shut down just three years later with the collapse of China’s biggest brokerage, Shanghai Wanguo Securities.
In February 1995, Shanghai Wanguo placed a huge “sell” order of futures without holding sufficient funds to back the trades in margin accounts.
Prices plummeted, leading to disarray in the market and a swift move to shut the brokerage down on fears that it had grown too quickly.
The firm’s chief executive, Guan Jinsheng, known as the godfather of China’s securities industry, was jailed for his role in the affair.
Trading in bond futures was reopened in 2013 but regulators have remained cautious on the pace at which participants are introduced.

China’s biggest airlines have demanded compensation from Boeing for grounding their 737 Max fleets, heaping pressure on the US aircraft maker on the eve of a crucial regulatory meeting to determine if the plane is allowed to fly again.
The aircraft has been grounded around the world since March when one of the jets crashed in Ethiopia, killing all 157 people on board, just five months after another 737 Max crashed in Indonesia, killing 189 passengers and crew. The two fatal crashes were blamed on design flaws and other errors in the aircraft’s safety system.
On Wednesday, a spokesperson for Air China, the country’s flagship carrier, confirmed it was seeking compensation but declined to provide further details.
China Southern Airlines said in an email that it was demanding compensation for “losses caused by the Boeing 737 Max grounding and late delivery”.
The Guangzhou-based carrier grounded 24 737 Max aircraft in on March 11, in accordance with an order issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of China （CAAC）.
“We have asked Boeing to negotiate a compensation plan as soon as possible,” it added.
The Chinese Communist party’s flagship newspaper, the People’s Daily, reported that the third of China’s “big three” carriers, Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines, had also demanded compensation from Boeing.
China Eastern declined to comment, but a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry said that any such compensation requests would be justified. “The Boeing 737 Max aircraft was grounded all over the world for safety reasons and the technical problems have not been solved yet,” the spokesman said. “But it is justifiable for any enterprise to claim its legitimate interests in accordance with law.”
Aviation regulators from around the world are scheduled to meet Federal Aviation Administration officials on Thursday in Texas, where they will review Boeing’s application to allow the aircraft to fly again.
The CAAC did not respond to a request for comment about the compensation demands — or on its likely position at Thursday’s meeting.
The CAAC was the first regulator to order a suspension of the 737 Max in on March 11, highlighting its growing clout.
US president Donald Trump and the FAA followed the CAAC’s lead two days later.
China is expected to overtake the US as the world’s largest aviation market by 2033, propelled by its demand for single-aisle aircraft, according to Boeing projections.
China has the world’s biggest 737 Max fleet, with 97 planes accounting for more than a quarter of total deliveries to date.
The country is a crucial market for the 737 Max, with Chinese airlines and leasing companies accounting for at least 10 per cent of Boeing’s unfilled order book for the aircraft.
Ireland-based Avolon, part-owned by China’s troubled HNA Group, and aviation leasing companies controlled by Bank of China and China Development Bank have more than 260 737 Max planes on order.
A spokesperson for Boeing’s China operations declined to comment on the compensation requests, saying “we don’t discuss our conversations with customers”.
While Chinese and US officials are bracing themselves for a new round of tariffs on each others’ merchandise exports that will take full effect on June 1, Beijing is sensitive to perceptions that it might target large US investors with non-tariff related administrative sanctions as part of its retaliation.
Both Boeing and its main rival, Airbus, have moved key parts of their supply chains to China and also opened assembly facilities in the country.

The UN  has overwhelmingly backed a resolution demanding that the UK relinquish control of the Chagos Islands, which hosts a US military base, in a move that leaves the two countries diplomatically isolated on the matter on the world stage.
The UN General Assembly passed a motion by 116 votes to 6, urging the UK to “unconditionally withdraw its colonial administration” from the Chagos archipelago and return control of the islands to Mauritius within six months.
Apart from the UK and the US, only four other countries — Hungary, Israel, Australia and the Maldives — voted against the motion.
Germany and France were among the 56 countries that abstained.
The vote came after the International Court of Justice  declared British control of the Chagos Islands illegal in February.
The non-binding motion is expected to have little immediate effect, but the embarrassing defeat will increase pressure on Britain to cede the islands to Mauritius.
Following the end of the British colonial administration, the UK purchased the islands from Mauritius for £3m in 1965 to form the British Indian Ocean Territory.
It later relocated the archipelago’s entire population to build a military base with the US on the largest island, Diego Garcia.
The UK has signalled that it could give up control “when no longer required for defence purposes”.
In 2016, it extended the US lease on  Diego Garcia until 2036.
However, Pravind Jugnauth, prime minister of Mauritius, said in the UN that his country had “publicly committed to enter into a long-term arrangement” to provide certainty around the military base.

On my way into work each morning I pass an unlovely concrete spot at the back entrance of the Financial Times where the building’s last surviving smokers can still have a quiet fag.
It is years since I have felt the urge to join them but I was up against such a nasty deadline not long ago that I cadged a cigarette from one of the few people I know who still smokes and headed outside.
A man I had never met before offered a light and, as we puffed away companionably, he started telling me about his job in some distant part of the building where people worked on FT conferences and events.
As I listened to him chat about how everyone had been flogging themselves to promote a looming conference he feared would flop, an awful thought began to form: he was talking about an event that I was due to chair.
This was an instant, if brutal, reminder of the value of smoking at work.
It is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of finding out what is really going on in the office.
Admittedly, it can sometimes be too effective.
I was working in Washington in 1994 when the city was rocked by the arrest of Aldrich Ames, a CIA officer who turned out to be a highly destructive Soviet mole who had betrayed a string of US agents for scads of cash.
Ames was a terrific smoker.
Pricey dentistry to fix his yellowing fangs raised early suspicions about his improved financial circumstances.
But his smoking habit also reportedly helped him obtain useful information about CIA operations against Russia — from desks that were nowhere near his own.
When he went outside to smoke at the CIA’s Langley headquarters, he would gather with fellow faggers in the agency and trade gossip.
This was an unusually lethal example of how office smoking helps to boost the flow of information, yet it is also oddly relevant.
As companies grapple with dismal workforce productivity growth rates, there is rising interest in the random office chat.
In theory, the more people bump into each other and blather, the more likely they are to swap ideas, stumble on solutions and generally become more productive.
Not that many years ago, a lot of this bumping happened naturally.
Back in the 1990s, US office workers told researchers they spent up to 70 per cent of their day talking face to face with their colleagues.
This has clearly changed in an age of far-flung, home-working, phone-pinging workforces.
Today’s offices are full of people staring at their screens at open plan desks with headphones jammed unsociably over their ears to block out noise.
And far fewer, thankfully, smoke.
Thus we are seeing a number of design “solutions” to make workers collide with one another more often, starting with the stairs. A big wide staircase that lets two people chat side by side is one idea architects are offering to increase office blather. This is fine if you are building a new office or can afford a new staircase, but useless for most of us.
Another idea is simpler: a coffee machine on wheels that can be strategically shifted to lure different teams of workers to the same spot to encourage productive chats.
I first heard about this from Ben Waber, an American I met last year who runs a company called Humanyze that tracks the way people move around in the office.
Personally, I like to know where to find a coffee each day.
Being forced to hunt around for a missing machine sounds tiresome.
I am indebted to a reader for my favourite ploy: an office beer fridge.
A man from the US who has started and managed several companies wrote to tell me on-site grog had several proven benefits.
Everyone got to know each other quickly, he said, “from production worker to the CEO”, and that made a big difference to the way they worked with one another.
He insisted on certain ground rules: no one could open the fridge until everyone in the building could drink and everyone had to be sure they could either drive home safely or get a lift.
My informant said he had never lost any productivity with this perk.
He plans to measure if people are actually more productive when a beer fridge is present.
I cannot wait to see the results.

Shares in Hikvision, the world’s largest surveillance company, dropped on Wednesday following a report that the Trump administration was considering blocking it from buying US technology.
Hikvision shares fell as much as 10 per cent, the daily limit, in Shenzhen to touch the lowest intraday level since October.
The shares later trimmed losses to be 6.1 per cent lower.
The New York Times reported that the manufacturer, which supplies surveillance technology to detention camps in Xinjiang, is set to become President Donald Trump’s latest target after Huawei.
Last week, Huawei was  effectively banned from selling technology into the American market and from buying components from US suppliers as Washington ratcheted up attacks on the Chinese tech group.
The Financial Times reported in March that Washington was taking a  tougher stance on Chinese companies such as Hikvision that receive support from US investment funds.
The company supplies systems to detention camps in Xinjiang, western China, where an estimated 1m  Uighur Muslims are being held, according to human rights groups.  Its facial recognition cameras are also  deployed to track Muslims visiting hundreds of mosques in the region.

Panasonic has halted shipments of some components to Huawei in order to comply with US export restrictions, in the latest setback for the Chinese telecoms equipment maker.
In a statement on Thursday, the Japanese group, which makes car batteries, smartphone components and other devices, said it had sent an “internal notification that it should suspend transactions with Huawei and its 68 affiliates that were banned by the US government”.
Panasonic said the ban applies to its goods that are comprised of 25 per cent or more of US-based technology, software or materials.
It declined to specify which of its components were affected, but the company considers the impact on its earnings to be limited for now.
The decision by Panasonic came as UK chip designer Arm, which is owned by Japan’s SoftBank, said it would stop licensing  essential technology to Huawei so it can comply with the US ban order issued last week.
The Chinese telecoms group was dealt a series of blows after large mobile operators in Japan and the UK pulled planned launches of new Huawei smartphones.

A federal judge has handed a defeat to Donald Trump, ruling that the US president could not prevent Deutsche Bank and Capital One from providing financial records to investigators in Congress.
House of Representatives intelligence and financial services committees subpoenaed the banks in March, and last month President Trump sued, asking the court to invalidate the subpoenas on the grounds that they were designed to “harass” him and “ferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage”.
But District Judge Edgardo Ramos on Wednesday found that Congress was within its authority to demand the records.
A representative of Deutsche Bank said: “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorised investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.”
President Trump was joined in his suit by his children Donald, Eric and Ivanka, as well as the Trump Organization.
The defeat follows another earlier this week, in which a judge turned back the president’s efforts to prevent the release of records by Mazars USA, the accounting firm.
The House oversight committee had subpoenaed Mazars after the president’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, told Congress that Mr Trump had routinely exaggerated or underestimated his assets for his financial benefit.

For the past three decades, many emerging economies have relied on their role in global trade and supply chains to drive growth — but disruption is biting them as the trade war between the US and China intensifies.
The fallout is hitting growth projections across the globe, from commodity producers in Latin America to apparel and electronics manufacturers in Asia.
The intensifying trade war has proved a boon for some emerging economies — such as Vietnam, South Korea and Taiwan — as companies shift manufacturing away from China.
However it is not proving enough to offset the overall impact of the global trade slowdown and China’s stuttering economic growth.
Global trade fell by 1.9 per cent in February from a year earlier on a rolling three-month basis, according to the Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis — the third consecutive month of contraction, and the biggest such fall since the financial crisis.
“The headwinds against emerging markets are gathering force,” said Hung Tran, non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington.
As a consequence, emerging economies are set to grow by 4.4 per cent this year according to the International Monetary Fund — their slowest rate since 2015.
The slowdown is particularly noticeable in emerging Asian economies, which are set to grow at their slowest rate since 2001 — by 6.3 per cent — the Fund forecasts.
William Jackson of Capital Economics said: “Emerging Asia is still a fast-growing part of the world but growth is coming in below expectations.”
Sergi Lanau, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, noted that the outlook had brightened somewhat since the gloom earlier this year when some analysts feared the world would slip into recession.
He predicts “roughly stable growth” for emerging economies this year.
“It is very different from what people were contemplating a couple of months ago, when the stories sounded a lot like the risk of global recession,” he said, although he conceded that the forecast was “not an improvement” on their recent performance.
Chinese domestic policy focus is adding to the economic headwinds for its trade partners.
China’s pivot from investment-led growth to consumption has curtailed demand for commodities, and it is shifting manufacturing onshore.
The Chinese government’s “Made in China 2025” plan aims to increase the proportion of core components and materials that are produced domestically to 40 per cent next year and 70 per cent by 2025.
So the single biggest national contributor to world growth for more than a decade will import less from the rest of the world, especially its traditional suppliers in other emerging markets.
“These changes are reducing the role of global supply chains, independently of US tariffs,” Mr Tran said.
This is exacerbated by China’s economic slowdown.
Growth has slowed every year since 2010, and Mr Jackson said it was likely to be “softer than many people think” in the coming months.
“For the rest of the emerging world, that’s a headwind that could prevent a broad recovery,” he said.
And several major emerging economies are mired in local difficulties.
Argentina and Turkey have yet to escape from last year’s currency crises, when local imbalances were exposed by the strong US dollar and exacerbated by policy mistakes at home.
Growth in Brazil has failed to ignite as investors lose faith in its new government.
Political uncertainties also dog Mexico.
Russia has impressed many analysts by maintaining fiscal discipline under western sanctions, but at the cost of depressed household incomes and falling consumption.
Some of the brighter spots in the emerging world are countries that benefit from the shift of US trade away from China.
In the first quarter of this year, US imports from South Korea and Taiwan rose by 20 per cent compared with the same period last year, while imports from Vietnam rose by 40 per cent.
Overall imports from Asean countries rose by 12 per cent.
The effect is particularly strong for products that are affected by tariffs.
US imports from Vietnam of telephony apparatus nearly tripled in the first three months of 2019, year on year, while imports of computers and parts nearly doubled.
US office machine components imports from South Korea nearly doubled, and telephone apparatus imports rose 30 per cent.
Similarly imports of computer parts from Taiwan doubled and office machinery nearly tripled.
Yet the trade diversion is still too little to compensate Asian countries for the contraction of their exports to China, which is by and large their main trading partner.
All Asian countries’ export volumes slowed or contracted in the first quarter of this year.
“China’s Asian trading partners are among the biggest losers from the trade war,” said Adam Slater, an economist at Oxford Economics.
Mr Tran at the Atlantic Council says the warning signs cannot be ignored.
“If you can picture a perfect storm for emerging economies, it’s not on us yet but the risk is looming,” he said.

Britain’s largest mobile phone network has pulled Huawei’s phones from its 5G launch after Google said it would comply with a US ban and stop supplying its Android operating system to the Chinese group.
EE, part of BT, unveiled its plan to launch 5G services next week with 5G phones from Samsung and OnePlus.
It had planned to offer Huawei phones but decided to “pause” their launch due to the uncertainty around the use of the Android operating system in the future after Google pulled its licence over the weekend.
Marc Allera, chief executive of EE, said the company had “paused” the launch of Huawei’s 5G phones as it did not have the “surety of service” it needed to offer long term contracts.
“We’ve had to hold that back,” he said.
The company will however continue to use Huawei, alongside Ericsson, for the radio equipment for its 5G network despite the political debate around the use of the Chinese company’s equipment and its supply chain issues following the move by US authorities to put it on to the “entity list”.
Mr Allera said that it has tested its 5G network using Huawei technology and has had “no indications” from the UK government to change course.
He said that the supply chain restrictions were a concern but that the UK would not benefit from a lengthy delay to 5G launches while the situation is being resolved.
“There are so many scenarios and we don’t have any clarity. But we can’t stand still,” he said. “Nothing is crystal clear but we have to work within that ambiguity,” he said.
The debate around Huawei has overshadowed the launch of 5G services in the UK as networks have lobbied the government not to ban the Chinese company from 5G network builds.

One of Tesla’s longtime fans on Wall Street slashed his worst-case scenario for the stock price to a mere $10, in the latest sign that analysts have begun to lose faith in Elon Musk’s electric car maker.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said yesterday that his new “bear case” for the shares, down from a previous estimate of $97, could materialise if Tesla were to miss his forecast for sales in China by roughly half.
Mr Jonas also raised concerns about a “highly volatile trade situation in the region” and Tesla’s mounting debt load.
“This year’s sharp deceleration in demand has led to a substantial curtailment of the company’s ability to self-fund through free cash flow generation, at the margin potentially impacting the firm’s access to capital,” Mr Jonas wrote in a note to clients.
He added: “We believe as Tesla’s share price declines, the likelihood of the company potentially seeking alternatives from strategic/industrial/financial partners rises.”
Shares in Tesla have dropped almost 40 per cent so far this year.
The stock slipped as low as $196.04 in morning trading yesterday, down 4.7 per cent on the day, before rebounding.
The cautious view from Morgan Stanley — one of the underwriters of Tesla’s initial public offering in 2010 — came amid growing scepticism on Wall Street that Tesla can increase profits and meet ambitious sales targets.
Wedbush’s Daniel Ives, another former bull on Tesla, warned this week that the company faces a “Kilimanjaro-like uphill climb” to rein in spending, describing the current situation as a “code red”.
Mr Ives, who lowered his price target to $230 from $275, knocked Tesla for pursuing “sci-fi projects” such as robotaxis  rather than focusing on shoring up demand for the key product, the Model 3.
Baird’s Ben Kallo said he continued to believe Tesla was positioned to outperform over the long haul.
But he, too, lowered his price target yesterday to $340 from $400, citing “constant noise” around the stock and “a lack of meaningful data points”.
The shift in sentiment has made Tesla the worst-rated stock among the Nasdaq 100, according to Bloomberg data.
Analysts have an average rating of 2.75 on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being a strong sell.
Nearly 42 per cent of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a sell rating compared with less than one-third one year ago.
Wall Street’s average price target is $290.94, down from approximately $320.
Mr Jonas maintained his price target for Tesla shares at $230 with a “bull case” of $391 and an equal-weight recommendation.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The fall in Tesla’s shares has accelerated this month after it announced it would raise about $2.3bn by selling common stock and convertible debt.
The cash infusion came after sales in the first quarter fell 31 per cent compared with the previous three months, coinciding with moves to lower prices on some models.
The California-based company has also come under renewed scrutiny over Autopilot, its driver-assist software.
A US transportation regulator found last week that Autopilot was engaged at the time of a fatal crash in Florida.

The White House has dangled a potential lifeline in front of Huawei.
Less than 24 hours after Google said it would cut off the Chinese smartphone maker from Android, the US granted a three-month reprieve on a ban that has also stopped other US software companies and chipmakers from selling to Huawei.
The temporary general licence “grants operators time to make other arrangements and the [commerce] department space to determine the appropriate long-term measures for Americans and foreign telecommunications providers that currently rely on Huawei equipment for critical services,” said commerce secretary Wilbur Ross.
Does this help Huawei?
Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder, says the reprieve “doesn’t mean much” because his company has contingency plans in place.
He is right, say analysts — but not for the reason he gives.
Huawei’s HiSilicon unit has been designing its own chips and stockpiling these and other parts.
But three months will not be enough for Huawei to reconfigure its supply chain.
“It’s not really helpful at all,” said Rex Wu at Jefferies.
Meanwhile, as Google’s move showed, there are crucial elements that cannot be stacked up in a warehouse or built from scratch.
A smartphone operating system is one.
Electronic design automation （EDA） is another.
EDA tools, made by the likes of Cadence, a US software and system design company, are used to determine whether the chip design works and can be manufactured.
The tools are a sort of black box for designers, according to Douglas Fuller at City University of Hong Kong, backed by a huge repository of chemical engineering and material science knowledge that is very hard to replicate.
This explains why it is dominated by three players, two American and one German.
There are pirated versions, but, says Mr Fuller, “at this point Huawei is making some rather sophisticated chips so they don’t want to be flying blind . . . by using pirated ones”.
So who does the reprieve help?
For many analysts and politicians, including Mr Ross, the temporary licence is an olive branch to chipmakers and other suppliers in the US that were caught short by the export ban and are sitting on inventory.
It is also directed at telecom carriers, says Peter Lovelock, director at digital trade and telecoms research firm TRPC.
But he adds that the 90-day window is insufficient time for them to switch from Huawei to new vendors, putting the sector in a difficult position.
While some analysts believe Huawei may have corralled European carriers into lobbying on its behalf, Mr Lovelock sees a more direct recipient of the message.
“The move was in part directed at European governments, for months the target of US diplomatic efforts to encourage key allies and like-minded countries to adopt measures to restrict or completely ban Chinese equipment for their 5G networks,” he said.
“If the US commerce department were to eventually enforce a complete ban on US technology shipments to Huawei, any carrier currently using the company’s equipment would need to radically alter its 5G buildout strategy.”
Finally, it gives non-US companies room to work out how far they are on the hook.
German microprocessor group Infineon has reportedly stopped shipping to Huawei, and other chipmakers including Toshiba are assessing whether to follow suit.
This illustrates the interconnectedness of global supply chains: a German or Japanese company is often dependent on US capital equipment or research and development.
Will the licence be  extended?
There is no precedent. The first and only other recipient of this type of general licence was ZTE, Huawei’s smaller rival that was similarly hit with an export ban last year. But ZTE had a clear path to resolve its problems: pay a fine and rejig its board. There is no such template here.
That is at least partly because Huawei, unlike ZTE, is not being punished for any one thing.
It is also on notice for sanction-busting sales to Iran, for which its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is under house arrest in Canada and facing extradition to the US.
Huawei has long battled a bigger undercurrent with the US over its alleged use of back doors, espionage and intellectual property theft.
The company has come to symbolise broader US angst over China’s industrial policies and rising tech prowess.
That makes it more difficult to gauge whether or not the licence will be rolled over, potentially buying time for Huawei.
Politics further muddies the waters.
Last week’s ban was seen in both countries as being directly linked to the ongoing trade talks.
But the Trump administration did not brief the US technology sector in advance, and only after the fact were companies able to outline the impact and harm that the ban would inflict domestically, prompting the partial rollback.
Yet with the political environment shifting so rapidly in Washington in favour of a more confrontational stance towards Beijing, the reprieve is not expected to last long.

Here’s a ritual that has emerged over the past decade. Leaders of 28 countries pull up in limos outside the imaginatively named Europa building in Brussels, where the European Council is meeting. They speak platitudes to the TV cameras, then greet their colleagues, sometimes with a kiss or a fist bump. They are on first-name terms: even the rookie prime minister of a mini-state must find the courage to call the German chancellor “Angela”. Then, behind closed doors, over late-night dinner, they work out a compromise: whether Greece gets a bailout, say, or Britain is allowed to delay Brexit. This scene — described by Luuk van Middelaar in his new book on the EU, Alarums & Excursions— is what power in today’s Europe looks like.
There’s been much overheated talk that next week’s elections for the European parliament will decide the EU’s future.
But, in fact, even if populist parties surge, the union will muddle on.
In recent years, we have improvised our way into an EU that works for most Europeans of our generation.
We now have what Charles de Gaulle called a “Europe of nations”, in which the big decisions are made not by Brussels bureaucrats, or the European parliament, but by national leaders acting in concert.
The Europe of nations has arisen unplanned and largely unannounced.
It’s often drowned out by the ceaseless noisy European squabble between federalists and leavers.
However, both those groups have been marginalised.
They still provoke each other daily with their pronouncements — such as the federalist fantasy of a European army — but neither has the clout to get its way.
The federalists lack numbers. Just 14 per cent of European citizens feel “very attached” to the EU, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey; four times as many feel “very attached” to their country. No wonder Emmanuel Macron’s efforts to strengthen Brussels’ powers vis-à-vis member states found so little support beyond France, says Insead’s Douglas Webber, author of a 2018 book called European Disintegration?.
Meanwhile, on the leave side, Brexit has become such a mess that “the membership question is off the table”, says Brigid Laffan of the European University Institute in Florence.
Nigel Farage’s Brexit party is the only large leave movement contesting the coming elections.
Two-thirds of Europeans now feel their country has benefited from membership, the highest proportion since 1983, says Eurobarometer.
Shut off from the federalist-versus-leave sideshow, the EU has become ever more active.
This is driven by the growing role of national leaders.
They held only six European summits between 1961 and 1973 and, as late as 2007, the Treaty of Lisbon stipulated just two meetings every six months.
But then came the string of crises over the euro, Ukraine, refugees and Brexit.
Now the European Council meets six or seven times a year, peaking at 10 in 2015.
In addition, the Eurogroup of finance ministers usually meets monthly, and the Foreign Affairs Council of foreign ministers at least that, plus teleconferences.
The EU has progressed from making rules to dealing with events, says Van Middelaar.
Though national politicians commute to Brussels to represent their nation states, this isn’t old-style nationalism.
Probably never before have different countries anywhere worked together on such an everyday basis.
It’s a genuine concert of nations.
The biggest states speak loudest in the European Council — at crucial moments, the whole room literally looks at Merkel — but Ireland and Malta get heard too.
“The Union is not a state but a union of states,” concludes Van Middelaar.
Brexiters who rail against “unelected Brussels bureaucrats” and the “meddling European superstate” haven’t absorbed this reality.
In fact, most Europeans who “meddle” in British affairs are elected national leaders.
This became obvious over Brexit: the European Commission handled negotiations only as long as national leaders agreed, but once the controversial question of extending Brexit came up, the Council had to settle it.
Finally, Macron made sure the extension was short.
Similarly, during the Greek crisis it was Germany’s finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble, and not the Commission, who pushed for massive privatisation of Greek assets.
The European parliament watched almost powerless.
The only big recent federalist advances have been made to complete the main federalist project of the previous generation: the euro.
That has given us a mighty European central bank, the European stability mechanism and something like banking union.
Otherwise, federalists look on in frustration.
They worry about the Commission shrinking into a mere bureaucracy charged with executing the Council’s decisions.
The Spitzenkandidaten of Europe’s main political movements united during their debate in Florence this month to grumble about the Council.
“A common enemy”, Liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt called it.
There is indeed a risk that national leaders pushing national interests will kill the EU by a thousand cuts.
Yet national leaders making decisions together is much more democratic than a union run by the Commission technocrats.
If citizens don’t like the decisions, they can vote out the leaders.
Here is the mix of nationalism and Europe that works for our generation.

If you read the headlines, America seems to be lurching from one crisis to another.
But underneath the controversy, Donald Trump’s administration is undertaking far-reaching changes that will affect the lives of millions of Americans: they are rethinking the federal regulatory state.
Since taking office, the Trump administration has begun remaking the way rules and regulations on everything from stock trading to mining and food safety are implemented and evaluated.
Their goal is to relieve the American people from the burden of unnecessary red tape.
Thanks to these efforts, two regulations are being eliminated for every new one implemented and agencies are required to achieve a net reduction in total regulatory costs.
In April, the administration went further, giving new oversight powers to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and Office of Management and Budget over all new proposed rules, including documents that provide guidance on how to implement them.
These actions couldn’t have come at a better time.
By the end of 2017, the total cost of federal regulation alone was almost $2tn annually, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, or about $6,000 per person, and 10 per cent of US gross domestic product.
Their efforts are yielding substantial reductions in the regulatory state.
In 2017, the Trump administration added 3,281 rules to the Federal Register, the fewest since records began in the 1970s.
In the administration’s first 23 months, it issued 40 per cent fewer regulations compared with its two predecessors in the same period of time.
It withdrew or delayed 1,579 rules from the Obama administration.
OMB estimates that this has cut the federal regulatory budget by $33bn.
Reforms like these rarely garner much attention but they are changing the fabric of the way rules are made.
The Trump administration is incorporating more robust economic analysis and empowering regulators to streamline oversight.
That changes the incentives within regulatory agencies in ways that cut costs for US businesses.
Because regulatory changes are not the only factor affecting the overall economy, it is all but impossible to measure the short-term impact on specific businesses or industries over the short term.
But I believe the shift in regulatory policy is having an undeniable effect on the economy right now.
After the 2008 financial crisis, the US had one of the slowest economic recoveries in its history.
Wages remained stagnant and the number of people on food stamp assistance programmes swelled to record numbers.
During the same period, the Obama administration imposed more than $100bn annually in new regulatory costs, according to the Heritage Foundation.
By 2016, nearly 74 per cent of American manufacturers reported that they were in an “unfavourable business climate”.
Two years into Mr Trump’s administration, just 18.5 per cent of American manufacturers reported the same thing.
Similarly, in 2016, 64 per cent of manufacturers were optimistic about the economy, rising to 92 per cent last year, a 20-year high.
The US is near its lowest unemployment rate in 50 years and consumer confidence is at the highest level in almost two decades.
Congress must play its role in dealing with laws that impose rules on Americans.
Last year, it partially repealed the Dodd-Frank Act on financial reform, freeing small and medium-sized banks from post-crisis rules.
It also passed the Right to Try Act, which allows terminally ill patients to obtain experimental drugs to save their lives.
Further changes in the regulatory regime will require more congressional action.
The present era in Washington may well be remembered for bombast and acrimony.
But the current administration’s most lasting legacy may end up being its quietest.

Trading volumes for the Chinese renminbi have ballooned since the escalation in tensions between the US and China over trade, reflecting concerns among fund managers that a potential breakdown in talks could dent the Chinese economy and pile pressure on the currency.
In the week ending May 10, trading volumes in the offshore renminbi were 120 per cent higher than averages over the previous month, according to London-based EBS, one of the key systems that banks use to deal with each other.
The shift comes as speculative investors square off with China’s central bank over whether the renminbi will sink to Rmb7 against the dollar, a low that has not been broken since 2008.
Some speculators believe the Chinese currency is heading for a heavy fall beyond that point as the economy weakens, but many analysts believe authorities will fight to prevent an ugly decline.
“The critical battle ...is in the foreign exchange market,” said Marc Chandler, a strategist at advisory firm Bannockburn Global Forex.
Chinese bankers in London have reported elevated volumes and volatility for the renminbi ever since May 5, when US President Donald Trump tweeted his intention to impose heavier tariffs on imports from the country, citing disagreements on trade talks.
In the last three weeks, China’s currency has weakened against the dollar, in both its onshore rate — which is allowed to fluctuate no more than 2 per cent beyond a midpoint set daily by the People’s Bank of China — and in the more flexible offshore form.
Analysts said policymakers would be unlikely to inflame tensions further by allowing the currency to weaken beyond Rmb7 to the dollar, as a perceived devaluation would anger the US and likely make negotiations more difficult at the June G20 summit.
Chinese authorities are also believed to be keen to avoid a rerun of the 2015 devaluation that triggered capital flight and led to the reintroduction of capital controls. The reluctance of the PBoC a to let the currency plummet shows in its daily fixings for the onshore exchange rate. Those fixings consistently give the renminbi a higher value than the offshore markets would imply, pushing the gap between those two rates to the widest point since February 2016.
Offshore exchange rates kept pushing higher on Monday, with the dollar reaching Rmb6.9480, the Chinese currency’s weakest point since November last year.
In the onshore market, the renminbi did not weaken beyond Rmb6.92, according to Reuters data.
Some investors believe the renminbi bears have a hopeless cause.
“Speculators have been trying to fight the Chinese government unsuccessfully for decades, but we’d rather be on the side of the 800lb gorilla than against it,” said Gregory Perdon, co-chief investment officer at private bank Arbuthnot Latham in London.
Dealers at global banks say that on some days, volumes in the renminbi surpass activity in the euro in early European hours. The renminbi has been the third most-traded currency on EBS since 2015, when the PBoC’s renminbi devaluation caused a spike in volatility and activity.
Chi Nzelu, JPMorgan’s head of electronic trading for instruments including the renminbi, said the Chinese currency was “very liquid” on the large and small electronic trading systems. “Participants used to consider the offshore renminbi as very much an [emerging-market] currency,” he said. But now the currency is almost as liquid against the dollar as the euro and the yen.

A US judge refused to block House Democrats from subpoenaing Donald Trump’s financial records from his accounting firm, rejecting the president’s arguments that congressional investigators were overstepping their authority.
The House oversight committee issued a subpoena to the accounting firm, Mazars USA, after Michael Cohen, the president’s former personal lawyer, told Congress that Mr Trump routinely inflated or underestimated his assets for his financial benefit.
Amit Mehta, a US district judge, said on Monday he would not intervene on behalf of Mr Trump or his business to block the subpoena issued to the accounting firm, while giving Mr Trump’s lawyers a week to appeal against the decision.
“According to the oversight committee, it believes that the requested records will aid its consideration of strengthening ethics and disclosure laws, as well as amending the penalties for violating such laws,” Mr Mehta said.
“These are facially valid legislative purposes, and it is not for the court to question whether the committee’s actions are truly motivated by political considerations.”
The judge said the subpoena would also allow Congress to verify that Mr Trump had not violated the foreign emoluments clause of the US constitution, which prevents US officials from accepting financial benefits from foreign governments.
Speaking outside the White House, Mr Trump said his lawyers would file an appeal, adding: “It’s totally the wrong decision by, obviously, an Obama-appointed judge.”
Separately, the House Ways and Means Committee is fighting to subpoena Mr Trump’s tax returns.
In that case, the president and his lawyers have also sought to fight back using claims of congressional over-reach.

Everything Amazon does has an impact and by leading a $575m funding round for the British food delivery company Deliveroo, it hurt shares in the latter’s rivals. The deal gives Amazon a stake in both delivery and preparation through “dark kitchens” in which some Deliveroo meals are made.
It is an arresting move — who knew that a company that started by selling books online would end up as the part owner of kitchens?
— but it is characteristic of Amazon’s roaming instinct.
It has moved from online retailing to running warehouses, publishing books, and making films and television shows for its Prime streaming service.
More surprising is the degree to which other technology groups are following Amazon in becoming vertically integrated.
Instead of sticking to the business of running platforms, they are creating their own content and buying assets to bolster themselves.
Netflix is close to a 10-year deal with Pinewood to lease studio facilities in the UK, while WeWork is raising $2.9bn for a property fund to buy offices that it will lease.
Apple is spending hundreds of millions on video game development for its Arcade service, pushing Microsoft and Sony to form a tentative alliance to defend their games franchises.
Integration is also developing in the other direction, with brands trying to find a path to sell directly to consumers, rather than through retailers.
Edgewell Personal Care, owner of the Wilkinson Sword and Schick men’s razor brands, this month acquired Harry’s, the razor subscription business, for $1.4bn. Investors took fright and Edgewell shares dropped to a 10-year low.
A sudden move to integrate by buying a supplier or distributor suggests vulnerability — why take the risk of doing it unless you fear being shut out?
Controlling the supply chain from parts to production, marketing and distribution secures autonomy.
But it also requires capital investment and is a challenge for any company to manage.
So far, technology companies have not been punished by shareholders for pursuing integration.
Amazon is trusted to handle acquisitions, such as that of Whole Foods, the US supermarket chain, and Netflix’s huge investment in original production has not alienated investors.
Their critics instead wonder whether they are acquiring too much power over markets.
Lina Khan, a fellow at Columbia Law School, has attacked Amazon for exploiting the gaps in US competition law, arguing that it has “marched toward monopoly by singing the tune of contemporary antitrust”. Ms Khan singles out its vertical integration, which is treated leniently by US authorities.
Amazon has expanded across its supply chain, into retailing and other services, and controls production and distribution assets, now including a stake in Deliveroo.
This enables it to offer its own goods and services to Prime subscribers, as well as boosting its bargaining strength with other suppliers.
This contrasts with the original approach of platforms such as Google and Facebook, which focused on building networks while relying on others for content.
Uber and Lyft have a similar strategy — creating ride services by linking drivers to customers, rather than by owning and operating taxis.
But as platforms mature, vertical integration is growing.
The meal delivery industry is one example, moving from a traditional platform approach to one in which companies such as Deliveroo and UberEats run kitchens.
Deliveroo is a pioneer with its Editions kitchen hubs, where meals are prepared by restaurants and caterers.
The threat is that someone else builds such facilities, limiting the power of any platform: Travis Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder, last year acquired a $150m controlling stake in the parent of CloudKitchens, which does so. Restaurants at its facilities in Los Angeles cook meals that are delivered by platforms including Uber Eats and GrubHub.
A similar battle is occurring in video games, with both Apple and Google setting up new streaming services.
The ideal for these companies would be to have games developers flock to their platforms and pay them fees, but competition is such that they cannot rely on that.
Apple is taking the same path as Netflix — investing in production to secure exclusive rights.
This makes technology companies more like media businesses that own distribution and content.
Vertical integration was limited in the 1970s and 1980s by rules barring US television networks from controlling too much production but has grown.
Mergers such as Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal have been approved by regulators.
The shift to integration by technology companies requires close scrutiny by competition authorities, as Ms Khan suggests.
But it is also an expression of weakness — platforms that used to be able to dictate terms to providers of content and services now feel the need to secure assets, rather than risk being shut out by others.
If so, investors may be treating the land grab across retailing, media and other industries too complacently.
They are accustomed to Amazon and others being able to dominate, but this burst of dealmaking tells a story of technology platforms losing control.

The number of European companies compelled to hand over valuable technologies in exchange for market access in China has doubled over the past two years, as Beijing and Washington clash over the contentious issue.
The latest business confidence survey by the European Chamber of Commerce, published yesterday, showed the problem has intensified even as negotiations between the US and China deepened earlier this year as part of a widening trade war between the two nations.
About 20 per cent of respondents to the survey said they felt compelled to hand over technology to Chinese business partners, up from 10 per cent two years ago. The survey comprised responses from 585 European groups.
“While European businesses have heard that China’s door will continue to open wider and wider, they have also witnessed sustained support for state-owned enterprises, higher incidences of unfair technology transfers and the strengthening of the Communist party’s role in business,” the report said.
Foreign companies have complained for decades that they must divulge sensitive trade secrets in order to set up fully integrated businesses in China.
Often referred to as “forced technology transfers”, the practice has been at the core of the US-China trade dispute, which escalated this month as the US ramped up tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports and China responded with similar measures on $60bn of US goods.
The Trump administration has also banned Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei from the US market, saying it poses a national security risk.
Ending what the US has called the theft of its companies’ intellectual property has become a key condition to winding down trade hostilities between the world’s two largest economies.
China has vowed to crack down on technology transfers but has also pushed back against the notion that such practices exist.
The People’s Daily newspaper, a mouthpiece for the Communist party, said in an editorial at the weekend that complaints of forced tech transfers were fabricated by the US.
Companies dealing in high-end technologies felt the greatest pressure, with about 30 per cent of respondents to the ECC survey in the chemicals and petroleum industry reporting they were pushed to disclose trade secrets. Some 28 per cent of medical device companies and 27 per cent of pharmaceuticals said they faced similar pressure.
The report noted technology transfers continued unabated even as the US and China moved into negotiations over the practice at the beginning of the year: “Worryingly, 63 per cent of respondents that have felt compelled to transfer technology said it happened within the last two years, and a quarter said the transfer was still taking place at the time of the survey period in January 2019.”
The survey also revealed that European groups found business conditions in China were deteriorating — 53 per cent said doing business there had become more difficult in the past year, compared with 48 per cent last year.

Last year, Starbucks closed more than 8,000 of its US coffee shops for diversity training after a central Philadelphia store called the police when two black men who were waiting for a friend asked to use the toilet.
Are these short diversity courses worth doing?
Not really, according to a new study from that Starbucks branch’s local business school, Wharton.
Bursts of diversity training can change attitudes slightly, but don’t really change behaviour.
The effect of diversity training courses is usually difficult to measure because of what researchers call demand or social desirability effects — people give the answers they think are expected or which make them look better.
The Wharton study attempted to go beyond these limitations.
It was large — the researchers worked with a big, unnamed, international organisation that invited nearly 11,000 of its staff worldwide to participate.
They got replies from 3,016 employees, of whom 61.5 per cent were male and 38.5 per cent were based in the US.
The rest came from 62 other countries.
The researchers divided the participants into three groups: one received gender-bias training, one training on gender bias, race and sexual orientation and the third, the control group, focused on psychological safety and active listening rather than gender or racial stereotyping.
In the training, which took place online and took an average of 68 minutes, participants in the first two groups heard about the psychological processes underlying stereotyping and the research that showed it could result in workplace inequality.
The course examined participants’ own implicit biases.
They also learnt about strategies for overcoming them.
The Wharton research found that training had a significantly positive effect on employees’ attitudes to female colleagues — but this was driven by the staff outside the US.
Their attitudes to gender parity improved markedly compared with the control group, whereas that of American participants did not.
The same applied to participants’ plans to be more inclusive towards women in the workplace in future.
Here again, the non-US employees’ intentions showed a real change, while Americans’ intentions did not.
But there had been significant differences between Americans and the rest to start with.
The US employees had been more favourable towards female participation before they did the training.
The non-US staff’s attitude had been less friendly, although still positive, and “therefore had more room to improve”, the researchers said.
So much for attitude and intentions: diversity training worked best on those who had previously thought about it least.
What about behaviour?
Shortly after the training, the organisation emailed employees about a new initiative, asking them to nominate five colleagues to mentor informally.
This wasn’t overtly connected to the training programme.
Among those who had done the diversity programme, there was no significant overall increase in the number of women selected for mentoring.
There was an increase in the US, but this was largely driven by women employees — largely those seeking mentoring from senior colleagues, regardless of gender.
A few weeks later, staff received emails asking for nominations to recognise a colleague’s performance.
Once again, those who had been trained showed no overall propensity to nominate women.
Those who did were mostly in the US.
A couple of months later, the organisation asked employees if they were willing to spend 15 minutes on the phone talking to a new male or new female recruit.
Here, there was a significant increase in people offering to speak to women, but this came mainly from other women.
The data on race were limited because the organisation tracked the racial backgrounds only of its US employees.
But there were significant increases in the numbers of US employees of ethnic minorities selected for mentoring and telephone chats and nominated for recognition — once again largely driven by other minority employees.
What does this research show?
That attitudes can change but behaviour takes longer.
It can encourage some people to act.
As the researchers said, one of the strongest effects was that “our training prompted women to connect with more senior women”.
Who the organisation recruits and puts into leadership positions probably matters more than diversity training.
Those who have benefited from the old ways may be willing to see others advance, but not if it disadvantages them.
As one who grew up — and prospered — with them, I should know.

Seven years ago, the Chinese smartphone maker Huawei opened a small research centre in Finland, tapping the home country of its rival Nokia for engineers who knew how to build a mobile phone operating system.
Starting with just 20 engineers, Huawei has gradually built up headcount in Finland, opening bases in Helsinki, Oulu and Tampere in preparation for the day when it might need an alternative to Android, the system that runs three-quarters of the world’s mobile phones.
Yesterday, it appeared as if Huawei’s worst fears had been confirmed.
Google, which bought Android in 2005, said it would stop supplying Huawei with Android software in order to comply with a US government ban.
Tim Watkins, head of Huawei in Western Europe, said the Chinese company had been “astounded” by the ban, but said Huawei was “as well prepared as we could have been”.
Nevertheless, analysts said being cut off from Android is a hammer blow to a company whose smartphone business has been growing at an incredible speed.
Huawei’s phone sales rose 50 per cent year-on-year to 59m in the first quarter, while its rivals Samsung and Apple saw their sales drop 10 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.
“Huawei seemed to have unstoppable momentum but with one single blow this could undermine their ambition to become the world’s largest smartphone maker,” said Ben Wood, principal analyst at CCS Insight.
Another telecoms consultant said the move by Google was the clearest sign yet that Huawei’s partners were “abandoning ship”.
He predicted that Washington would begin to “really squeeze the supply line properly now.”
Today, Huawei will launch its new flagship Honor phone in London.
But networks such as Vodafone and EE are reviewing whether they can press ahead with Huawei handsets at the heart of their launch strategy for 5G, the next generation of mobile internet.
Both companies declined to comment on what they would do.
Google and Huawei have worked closely over the past decade in a relationship that has benefited both sides.
Google has been able to build its access to the Chinese market while Huawei has quickly become a major player on the world stage.
But even if Huawei is ready with an operating system to replace Android, it will struggle to convince consumers outside of China to make the swap and lose their access to Google’s suite of apps, such as Gmail, YouTube and Maps, and to the 2.5m apps in the Google Play store.
Richard Windsor, an independent analyst, said that the quality of an in-house Huawei system was irrelevant as “no one is going to buy it”.
Companies including Nokia, BlackBerry, Microsoft, Intel, Palm, Firefox, Samsung and Finland’s Jolla have all attempted to break the Apple/Android duopoly to little or no effect.
Gartner research shows that less than 1.5m phones at the end of 2017 used an alternative operating system representing a mere 0.1 per cent of the market and most attempts to compete with Android have ended in failure.
Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said that the issue for Huawei in using its own operating system would be whether third-party developers would have any interest in supporting it and how smartphone users outside of China would be able to access Google. “Creating a store and supporting developers is not trivial,” she said.
Last year, the European Commission fined Google €4.3bn for abusing the dominant market position of Android to entrench its position in mobile search and to promote its Chrome browser.
But a shift away from Android, combined with a potential backlash against US companies including Apple in China, could lead to a fragmentation of the global mobile phone market, just as 5G is introduced.
Charlie Dai, an analyst with Forrester, said: “Eventually it’s no good toward consumers around the world, and it’s a pity that customer value facilitated by open-source spirit is now ruined by the politics.”
That could also prove to be a problem for Google itself with Android central to the smartphone market in China, which is bigger than Europe and the US combined, due to its use by Huawei and other phonemakers including Oppo and Xiaomi.
“I suspect Google are enraged by this,” said Mr Watkins.

Inequality is of greater concern today than for many years.
Politicians as diverse as Theresa May, Barack Obama and Jeremy Corbyn have proclaimed its centrality.
Yet we don’t know exactly what it is about inequality that bothers people so much or why some people are not concerned at all.
Or even what kind of inequality matters.
Is it that global cities like London are doing so well, and other places are doing so badly?
Is it the existence of “fat cats” who earn so much and are seen to contribute so little?
What about hard-working “fat cats”, or “fat cats” that bring prosperity to others?
Is it that gaps in life expectancy across space and across class are large and expanding?
Or is it that education and family life are so much better for some than for others?
Or is it that many people feel left behind, not only in the struggle for prosperity, but also in their ability to participate in society through politics, with many feeling that people like them are not represented in government?
The Institute for Fiscal Studies wants to address these questions for the UK, and try to get to the bottom of what might be the best ways of mitigating some of the most troubling inequalities.
On Tuesday, the IFS, with funding from the Nuffield Foundation, will launch a wide-ranging review of inequalities, which I will chair.
We plan to draw on a wide range of views from economics to demography, history, philosophy, politics, epidemiology and sociology.
The US holds the unenviable title as the world’s most unequal rich country, at least in terms of income.
We need to understand its problems and whether they are endemic to America, or risk being transmitted to Britain and elsewhere.
Perhaps the most troubling aspect of inequality in the US is the extent to which the lives of people without a four-year college degree have become worse and have diverged from the lives of those who are better educated.
For those without a college degree, real median wages have fallen for half a century.
For them, the quality of jobs has declined, participation in the labour force has fallen, as have marriage rates.
Unstable cohabitation has become more common and many men in their 50s have several children who they do not know or see.
One survey found that 57 per cent of Americans believe that there is no point in voting, because elections are controlled by the rich and by large corporations.
Worst of all, there is an epidemic of deaths by suicide, alcoholic liver disease and drug overdose, what Anne Case and I have called “deaths of despair”.
Not even death is equal.
The elderly and the educated are largely exempt from the rise, as, until the last few years, were African Americans.
Even suicide, which has historically been more common among the educated, has switched sides.
These deaths have caused all-population life expectancy to fall for three years in a row, for the first time since the horrors of the first world war and the influenza pandemic that followed it.
Perhaps the leading suspect behind these widening inequalities is the failure of real wages to rise for the less educated.
Even as US national income has grown, the gains have all gone to the more educated, while those left behind have lost, not only prosperity but the self-respect, status and meaning that come with good jobs and good marriages.
Is Britain also at risk from this failure of democratic capitalism?
On the plus side, Britain is inoculated against the enormous drag on prosperity that is the American healthcare system.
The UK’s social safety net, like those in Europe, is more complete and more generous than the American system, and helps protect people against the vagaries of globalisation and automation.
Britain has so far escaped the vast network of lobbyists in Washington that excludes the interests of ordinary people on many issues.
Britain does a better job of restricting opioids.
Yet there is much to worry about.
Median wages have been stagnant for a decade.
Deaths of despair are rising in England, especially in the north-east and in decaying towns like Blackpool.
The long-established normal increase in life expectancy has faltered or even reversed.
The Brexit vote and subsequent chaos show how many people feel unrepresented by the cosmopolitan elites in both Westminster and Brussels, just as so many in the US were alienated from the coalition of elites and minorities that supported Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party.
Globalisation and automation are certainly among the deep forces that are helping promote internal divisions within the rich countries.
Yet they are common to all rich countries, so it is policy, not unstoppable historical forces, that is behind the events in America.
But we need to know more about the mechanisms.
We need to consider the role of anti-labour politics and policies, the law and the decline of the unions.
We must look at the behaviour of corporations, their reliance on outsourcing and the waning of antitrust enforcement.
There is much work to be done.

The Trump administration has issued a licence that will allow US companies to keep doing business with Huawei for the next three months, in a bid to contain the fallout from the export restrictions on the Chinese telecoms equipment maker.
The licence would enable operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks in the US, the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said in a statement.
“The temporary general licence grants operators time to make other arrangements and the [commerce] department space to determine the appropriate long term measures for Americans and foreign telecommunications providers that currently rely on Huawei equipment for critical services,” Mr Ross said.
Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder, said the reprieve “doesn’t mean much” to the company as it had already prepared for a potential blacklisting, and warned that the US was underestimating Huawei.
“We will not easily and narrowly exclude US chips ...but if there is a supply shortage, we have a backup,” Mr Ren said in an interview with Chinese state media on Tuesday. “The current practice of American politicians underestimates our strength.”
Earlier on Monday, Google said it would stop providing Huawei with its Android software in order to comply with the export restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump.
One industry source said that Google could now resume providing the software.
Google and Huawei declined to comment.
Last week, as US-China trade tensions flared, the Trump administration abruptly announced that it was placing Huawei on the commerce department’s export blacklist — known as the entity list.
This requires US companies wanting to sell to Huawei to obtain a special licence from the US government under a “presumption of denial”, meaning that Washington’s default position would be that any application would be rejected.
As well as dealing a blow to Huawei in the US and around the world, the move by the Trump administration triggered a sell-off in shares of US technology companies, including chipmakers, who are big suppliers to Huawei.
John Neuffer, president and chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents nearly 95 per cent of the US semiconductor industry, said: “We hope to work with the administration to broaden the scope of the license so it advances US security goals in a manner that does not undermine the ability of the . . . industry to compete globally and ensures [its] economic security.”
In a notice in the US government’s federal register on Monday afternoon, the commerce department’s bureau of industry and security said it was authorising “engagement in transactions” with Huawei and its affiliates under certain conditions.
Those included deals “necessary to maintain and support existing and currently fully operational networks and equipment, including software updates and patches” as well as those contracts “necessary to provide service and support, including software updates or patches to existing Huawei handsets”.
Michael Allen, managing director at Beacon Global Strategies, a Washington-based national security consultancy, said the significance of the temporary licence was that it gave companies affected by the order a “stay of execution”.
“This gives time to US business to adapt or consult with the US government and, if convincing, possibly win changes to a final order,” Mr Allen said. “The Chinese may also view this move as an opening to win changes in the trade talks, if they are resuscitated.”
In its statement, the US commerce department said that after three months it would evaluate whether to extend the temporary licence any further, but it reiterated the reasons why Huawei had been placed on the export blacklist in the first place.
“The department concluded that the company is engaged in activities that are contrary to US national security or foreign policy interests, including . . . providing prohibited financial services to Iran, and obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation of those alleged violations of US sanctions, among other illicit activities,” it said.
The move by Mr Trump to slap Huawei with such wide-ranging and damaging restrictions in its ability to engage in business with US companies further dented hopes that the US and China could patch up their negotiations on trade.
Those talks broke down earlier this month after Mr Trump accused Chinese officials of reneging on key aspects of the proposed agreement, particularly US demands that it codify structural reforms, including protections for American intellectual property, into Chinese law.
The US then proceeded to increase tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports from 10 per cent to 25 per cent — and to threaten to impose levies of 25 per cent on a further $300bn of Chinese imports as early as the end of June, dramatically raising the stakes in the trade war.
Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, said last week that plans were under way for a trip to Beijing to engage in further discussions with Chinese officials, but none had been planned as of early this week.
Mr Trump is expected, however, to meet Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at the G20 summit in Japan next month, which could offer a window for a new detente.

Huawei is under siege.
Google is restricting parts of its Android operating system to the Chinese telecoms tech giant.
US chipmakers are poised to suspend supplies too.
The US move to put the Chinese telecoms flagship on its so-called Entity List — requiring American companies to obtain a government licence to sell to it — is a pivotal moment for the global technology industry.
It represents an opening salvo in an emerging new US-China cold war.
It is also a serious miscalculation.
All countries have a right to protect national security interests — nowhere more than in 5G telecoms, nervous system of the future digital economy and the “internet of things”.
The Trump administration’s moves last week, however, go far beyond what is needed to address security concerns.
They also seem far more than an attempt to pressure Beijing into reaching a trade deal.
They amount to an effort to decouple the US and Chinese tech sectors, leading to a bifurcation of the global industry.
This reflects a view reaching beyond the Trump White House and deep into the US security establishment that President Xi Jinping’s China is a malign actor, and that its technology is on course to outstrip America’s.
Indeed, the US steps appear part of an attempt to constrain China’s rise.
Echoes of the Soviet era abound, but Soviet industry was never entwined with America’s in the way China’s is.
The latest US moves seem designed to cripple or crush one of the first Chinese tech companies to become globally competitive — and one that relies on American suppliers in both mobile phones and network equipment.
Assuming the US administration sticks to its measures, despite heavy lobbying by US businesses, they will damage American and other western corporate interests.
Allied capitals will resent the White House’s efforts to impose its writ.
However great the vulnerabilities in Huawei and the broader Chinese tech sector that they have revealed, the US steps may also ultimately fail. They are likely to spur a Beijing-led effort to address China’s weaknesses and develop a fully independent supply chain. A historical analogy might be China’s nuclear weapons programme: the departure of Soviet advisers in the late 1950s forced it to build its own A-bomb. The result could hasten a splintering of the internet and associated technologies to which China and Russia — which recently passed a law ensuring it can cut itself off the world wide web — have already contributed.
Indeed, while China is complaining bitterly about the US moves, Beijing must take a good share of the blame for the situation it is now in.
China has blocked multiple foreign companies and websites, including Twitter, Facebook, and Google services including Gmail and YouTube.
The number of European companies compelled to hand over technologies in exchange for market access in China has doubled in two years, a report showed on Monday.
While western intelligence agencies disagree on the size of the security threat Huawei represents, all point to China as the biggest source of cyberattacks on security and industrial assets.
If China wishes to change its image as a malign force, it must rein in such attacks.
Yet Washington’s coercive steps are misguided.
The US and the west should not seek to block China’s rise but encourage it to cooperate in a rules-based system, by setting good examples themselves.
Washington’s allies should be free to determine what steps they judge necessary to combat security threats from Huawei or others.
The US has the right to take security steps too — but not to allow these to slide into destabilising protectionism.

It may be futile to try to predict what motivates Donald Trump on trade policy.
For investors, however, it is a painful but necessary task.
This week, Mr Trump appeared to suddenly reverse course on the prospects of a bilateral trade deal with China.
Markets, which had expected the deal was close to completion, were shocked and stock prices fell sharply.
Instead of imminent agreement, trade tensions escalated, with the threat of a new round of tariffs.
So far, Mr Trump’s trade wars have not had disastrous macroeconomic effects either locally or globally.
There is currently a considerable disconnect between the discord around the negotiating table and in the equity markets and, in most cases, what has heretofore happened to the real economy.
This week was a case in point.
Data released over the past few days showed US industrial production unexpectedly weak in April, falling by 0.5 per cent against economists’ average expectations of a rise.
Retail sales also declined in April.
But that weakness followed the biggest one-month rise in retail sales for 18 months in March, and a rapid expansion in overall gross domestic product in the first quarter.
Retail sales also had a bad month in China, where they grew at their slowest pace for nearly 16 years in the 12 months to April.
As in the US, industrial production was also weaker than expected.
On the other hand, fears of a general collapse in world trade were assuaged with the news that Germany, the export powerhouse of the eurozone and a country that might be expected to suffer from a contraction in cross-border trade, avoided recession with GDP growth of 0.4 per cent in the first quarter.
The fact remains that it is hard to read across from the trade actions taken so far to events in the global economy.
However, investors are right to be concerned about the ramping-up of aggressive trade behaviour by the White House.
It may be that these mixed bags of backward-looking data simply reflect a lag before the trade war hits growth, not evidence that the shock will fail to arrive at all.
It seems scarcely credible that the world trading system could undergo a serious dislocation without some significant effects on GDP as companies switch operations and supply chains have to be rebuilt.
Accordingly, a sense that the global economy is in the hands of policymakers with a casual disregard for the normal operations of trade should undoubtedly make markets react badly.
Mr Trump appears to have competing and often contradictory motivations — the net impact of which may shift rapidly — including reducing bilateral deficits, appearing to be tough on China （and other trading partners like the EU and Japan）, being regarded as a master dealmaker, keeping stock prices up and, with them, his popularity.
Perhaps the most damaging possibility of all is that Mr Trump likes import tariffs for their own sake and believes they are perforce a tax on trading partners and hence necessarily a win for America.
All of this should provide a salutary lesson for investors who were caught out this week, having priced in a US-China deal before it was in the bag.
Mr Trump’s actions may not be entirely random, but it pays to assume a wide probability distribution around forecasts of his policy moves.
Markets like simple trading rules they can follow, such as tying Mr Trump’s bellicosity to movements in the S&P 500.
No such one-dimensional analysis has managed to hold as yet.
Barring a substantial change in the president’s temperament, it never will.

Theresa May, the British prime minister, told MPs yesterday they would have the chance to vote on whether to hold a second EU referendum if they supported her “bold new” Brexit deal.
But the move, designed to win opposition votes, immediately prompted a backlash among Eurosceptics in her own party.
Mrs May said there was also a possibility of moving towards a close customs arrangement with the bloc if MPs backed her withdrawal agreement bill — the legislation implementing the draft exit treaty with the EU — in two weeks.
Her latest plan has been characterised by many MPs as a final, desperate bid to win House of Commons backing for a deal that has already been rejected three times.
Mrs May acknowledged the “genuine and sincere strength of feeling” across parliament over the Brexit plan, calling on those MPs who want a second referendum to back the bill.
But Brexiter Tory MPs responded to Mrs May’s speech with fury, with many who previously backed her deal vowing to vote it down next month.
“The prime minister’s latest proposals are worse than before and would leave us bound deeply in to the EU,” said Jacob Rees-Mogg, a leading Tory Eurosceptic.
“It is time to leave on World Trade Organization terms.”
Zac Goldsmith, another Conservative MP who supported the deal in March, said Mrs May’s latest proposal was ­“grotesque”, adding: “I cannot support this convoluted mess . . . The prime minister must go.”
Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, dismissed the proposals as “repackaging the same old bad deal”, which he indicated his party would not back.
“It’s clear that this weak and disintegrating government is unable deliver on its own commitments,” he said.
In another nod to Labour, the prime minister promised MPs a vote to choose between government plans to reduce trade friction with the EU but remain outside a customs union, and alternative proposals for a temporary customs union for goods.
Mrs May’s cabinet held heated discussions yesterday on updating the Brexit plan.
Many MPs see little chance that the Commons will back the exit deal and Mrs May has promised to lay out her plans to leave office if it is voted down again.
But following the collapse of talks on a Brexit compromise between the government and Labour, she has decided to press ahead with the legislation regardless.
Mrs May’s plan also seeks to address the fierce opposition expressed by Eurosceptic Tories and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party over the so-called backstop: measures intended to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.
But Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader in Westminster, said “the fatal flaws” of the Brexit deal remained and that his party was still opposed.

US carmaker Ford announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs worldwide, shedding about 10 per cent of its salaried workforce and inflicting deep cuts in its home market as part of an $11bn overhaul.
It joins General Motors, Volkswagen and Jaguar Land Rover in unveiling sweeping job losses, as global carmakers hunker down to deal with falling sales in China and the US, rising costs from the global trade war and the need to invest in electric cars.
Ford will lose 2,300 salaried jobs in its home market of the US, where the company has so far avoided making cutbacks that could spark a political backlash in the wake of Donald Trump’s America First policies.
US rival GM has already faced vitriol from the president, who has championed a revival of the American rust belt, after its decision to close four US factories and lay off thousands of workers.
“Ford is a family company and saying goodbye to colleagues is difficult and emotional,” chief executive Jim Hackett wrote in a letter to the employees on Monday.
The cuts are part of a wider “redesign” of Ford’s business that will reduce bureaucracy and help speed up decision-making, something the carmaker needs in order to compete in the “fast-changing future,” he added.
The company is shedding costs and attempting to stem losses outside of the US in order to position the business to push into new areas such as electric cars, where it currently lags competitors.
Laying off 7,000 salaried employees, through voluntary and involuntary redundancies, will save the company about $600m, out of a global goal of shaving $11bn from its business.
The latest cuts include some measures that were already announced, such as losing 5,000 roles in Germany across salaried, hourly and part-time workers.
They also include new losses in the US and elsewhere.
About 1,500 of the US jobs affected were voluntary, while about 500 of the 800 expected involuntary losses will happen this week, Ford said.
In the UK, where Ford employs an estimated 12,000 people, the moves are expected to affect about 500 jobs.
The company aims to have completed its lay-offs by August.
Mr Hackett said the redesign of the business will include reducing the entire company to nine layers of management, down from 14.
So far, most of Ford’s efforts have been focused on its struggling international operations in Europe, South America and China.
It has pledged to cut “thousands” of roles in Europe, removed dozens of western executives from its Chinese business and outlined plans to exit its heavy truck business in South America.
The company has also launched a global alliance with Volkswagen that will see the pair work jointly on commercial vehicles and a new pick-up truck, with the possibility of developing other new vehicles together in the future.
Their partnership may also see Ford use VW’s electric technology for its cars.
On Monday, Mr Hackett said a company-wide effort to revamp the business included 1,000 staff and came up with more than 5,000 new initiatives or changes within the organisation.
Ford is not alone in cutting costs.
General Motors last year announced plans to shed seven plants globally and lay off thousands of workers to refocus its product line-up on the sport utility vehicles increasingly demanded by car buyers.
Last year, Ford killed off all but two of its traditional passenger car vehicles in the US.

South Korean exports shrank further in May reflecting a drawn-out downturn for chipmakers and uncertainty cast by the US-China trade war over the technology sector.
Asia’s fourth-largest economy is highly dependent on sales of high-tech electronic components to China.
The preliminary export data provide an early signal for the region’s technology supply chain, which this year has been battered by a cyclical correction following years of growth.
The sector has also been hit by a slower Chinese economy and rising concerns over the trade dispute between the world’s two biggest economies.
Analysts and companies had forecast a recovery for the second half of 2019 as chipmakers and their customers worked through high inventories and as growth picked up.
However, a slower than expected improvement for memory chip prices and uncertainty from the trade war has muddied that picture.
South Korea’s exports in the first 20 days of May totalled $25.7bn, down 11.7 per cent from $29.1bn the same period a year ago and following an 8.7 per cent year-on-year fall for the preliminary data in April, according to the Korea Customs Service.
Semiconductor exports — which rose almost 30 per cent in 2018 and make up a fifth of the country’s exports — were down by a third for the period to May 20 compared with a year earlier, and offsetting a 12.6 per cent increase in car shipments.
Exports to China — which account for more than a quarter of exports — fell 15.9 per cent.
Most analysts still expect an improvement for the chip sector later this year but hopes of a strong rebound appear to have been dashed.
“The worst is likely over . . . but trade is unlikely to have a ‘V-shaped’ recovery,” said Trinh Nguyen, an economist at Natixis in Hong Kong.
The data come as uncertainty swirls over US-China trade talks.
Both sides have announced tit-for-tat tariff increases.
The Trump administration last week ratcheted up pressure, moving to block the sale of Huawei products in the US and restrict US companies from supplying the Chinese company.
JJ Park, an analyst at JPMorgan in Seoul, noted that weak memory chip prices continued to weigh on South Korean chipmakers in April and May.
He cautioned that the proposed tariff increases could flow through to higher consumer prices and dent demand.
“I don’t think it is just a Korea issue, it will impact the entire tech supply chain globally,” Mr Park said.
Minoru Nogimori, a South Korea economist at Nomura, said the market would be looking ahead to the meeting between Donald Trump, US president, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at the G20 summit in Japan next month.
Some analysts are also pointing to potential upside from the trade war.
Ms Nguyen said while the dispute threatened to “hit at the heart of the supply chain” there was a “silver lining” for South Korean manufacturers.

Chinese authorities unwinding Anbang Insurance have received offers of up to $5.8bn for the group’s luxury US hotels business from bidders including Blackstone and Brookfield, according to people familiar with the sale process.
Seventeen potential buyers, also including South Korea’s Mirae Asset Management, SoftBank-owned Fortress and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, have made it to a final round, these people said.
The sale of Strategic Hotels, one of Anbang’s most valuable assets in the US, comes after the insurer was placed under the control of Chinese regulators last year when Wu Xiaohui, its founder, was jailed for 18 years on fraud and embezzlement charges.
If Blackstone prevailed, it would cap a remarkable series of deals involving the US private equity firm, which bought Strategic Hotels in December 2015 for $6bn before selling it three months later to Anbang, initially for $6.5bn.
Strategic’s 15 luxury hotels include the Fairmont Scottsdale, several Ritz-Carlton sites, some Four Seasons hotels, the Intercontinental in Chicago and the Westin in San Francisco.
The $1bn range in offers suggests diverse opinion about the value of the properties and the complexity of the deal.
Uncertainty over the US economy has depressed the bids, as has the fact that assets that require heavy capital expenditure are out of favour, according to investors who decided not to bid.
Management of Strategic has been in disarray since Anbang was taken over last year by what is now the Chinese Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In March of last year, David Hogin, chief operating officer of Strategic, wrote to Anbang seeking approval for the 2018 budget, according to a letter seen by the Financial Times.
“Given all the recent turmoil within our parent company, it is critically important that we communicate with [employees] that their salaries and benefits are proceeding in accordance with prior practice,” he wrote.
The price that Anbang originally paid to Blackstone was cut by just over $1bn to about $5.5bn after US regulators barred the Chinese group from buying Hotel del Coronado in San Diego as the hotel was close to a US naval base.
Meanwhile, the Anbang-owned Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York, which is not part of Strategic, remains closed while part of it is converted to apartments, even as that part of the real estate market in the city has softened .

Huawei is preparing to launch its own mobile phone operating system after Google said it would stop supplying it with its Android software, amid an intensifying US-China trade war that has rocked global markets.
The Chinese telecoms group was last week placed on a “banned entity” list by the White House, which forbids American companies from supplying it with technology.
Google said it was “complying with the order and reviewing the implications”.
Huawei, which overtook Apple to become the world’s number-two smartphone maker this year, relies on Google’s Android operating system for its phones and shipped more than 200m last year.
Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy, at Saxo Bank, said Google’s move was “effectively the starting signal of a technology cold war”, adding: “What we are witnessing is a potential reconfiguration of global trade.”
Tim Watkins, Huawei vice-president for western Europe, said the group had been “caught in the middle” of the trade war but had been preparing for the worst.
It has been working on its own operating system, which “can kick in very quickly”, he added.
He noted that the Huawei OS had already been trialled in some parts of China.
The Stoxx index tracking Europe’s tech sector, fell more than 3 per cent while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 1 per cent.
Huawei has become entangled in the US-China trade war with the effective ban coming just days after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 25 per cent and Beijing retaliated in kind.
Huawei also relies on chips made by US companies including Qualcomm and Intel.
Mr Watkins said it had stockpiled five years of spare parts and one year’s worth of components.
But Citi analysts said in a research note to clients that the potential software ban “could paralyse Huawei’s smartphone and equipment business”.
If Google blocks Huawei from Android, which is used on three-quarters of mobile phones and offers 2.5m apps, the Chinese group will still be able to use the basic, open-source version of the software.
But its future smartphones may lose access to apps including YouTube, Gmail and Maps, and to the Google Play store and to security updates.
This is likely to hit their attractiveness outside China, where many Google apps are already banned, analysts said.
Huawei said last year that its smartphone, tablets and laptops business generated 48 per cent of company revenue.
Richard Windsor, an independent analyst, said losing the Google ecosystem “is very likely to cost Huawei all of its smartphone shipments outside China” — which, according to data consultancies including Counterpoint Research, is about half its total.

As the trade dispute escalates between China and the US, classic Chinese movies about the “War to Resist America and Aid Korea”, as the Korean War of the 1950s is known in China, have made a reappearance on Chinese prime-time state television.
This is one of the many signs in China hinting at what analysts believe will now be a protracted trade conflict with Washington. Reluctant to accept  humbling terms demanded by Donald Trump to end the two countries’ year-long trade spat, Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist president, is preparing to lead his country into an all-out trade conflict with the world’s leading economic and technological power, just as Mao Zedong sent Chinese “volunteers” to take on US forces during the Korean War for four long, bloody years in the 1950s.
“If the bulk of this agreement is about China doing this and China doing that, that’s totally unpalatable to a domestic audience,” said one person briefed on the talks in Beijing.
Like Mao’s decision to enter the Korean conflict, Mr Xi’s choice seems at first glance a foolhardy one.
Sixty years ago Mao’s poorly equipped troops faced a technologically superior American military force in Korea.
Today China’s economy is far more dependent on exports to the US than the US is on exports to China.
After 30 years of near double-digit growth, the world’s second-largest economy is also entering a period of slowdown, resulting in mounting anxieties within the middle-class and private entrepreneurs over social mobility and Xi’s emphasis on state enterprises.
Meanwhile, the US economy accelerates.
But just as Chinese forces ultimately fought the US to a stalemate in Korea by pitting sheer troop numbers and a far greater tolerance for mass casualties against superior American firepower, Mr Xi reckons he can direct a successful, society-wide struggle in the trade dispute.
Chinese officials believe they have two distinct advantages vis-à-vis their US adversary in the next phase of the trade war.
The first is the levers of control that Mr Trump can only dream – or tweet – about.
US institutions such as the  Fed or the House of Representatives have resisted the US leader’s pressure, but Mr Xi need only snap his fingers and China’s party-controlled government, legislature, media and banking system will do his bidding.
Mr Trump, his treasury secretary and his chief economic adviser routinely try to “talk up” US stock markets. The Chinese Communist party has a “national team” of state-owned brokerages, banks and corporate giants at its disposal to “buy up” China’s markets when necessary. When the Shanghai Composite Index slumped almost 6 per cent to 2,906 points on the day after Mr Trump’s latest trade-war escalation, people briefed on the Chinese government response said the national team was told the “line in the sand” was 2,900. The next day the SCI rebounded.
Mr Xi’s second advantage is a long-simmering sense of historical grievance against foreign powers who have previously “bullied” and “humiliated” China – conveniently stoked, as it happens, by the party’s media mouthpieces.
When the Trump administration’s opening trade-talks demands were  leaked in May last year, the outrage many Chinese people felt was genuine.
Friedrich Wu, a professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, sums up the feelings of many when he describes them as “a list of surrender demands for China to acquiesce to.”
“It’s a [reversion] to the 19th century when western and Japanese powers dictated all the terms in their humiliating unequal treaties with a feeble Qing dynasty,” he says. “If there is a decoupling between the two economies, so be it. The Chinese people can endure more pain than the spoiled and hubristic Americans.”
Mr Trump, meanwhile, must contend with powerful constituencies —  farmers,  Wall Street, retailers,  consumers and a free media among others — who complain loudly about the cost of his tariffs on Chinese imports and doubt the wisdom of his strategy.

Huawei’s plans to ramp up production of its own processors have been derailed after the UK chip designer Arm said it would stop licensing its essential technology to the Chinese telecoms group.
The Cambridge-based company, owned by Japan’s SoftBank, said it was forced to cease sharing its technology with Huawei to comply with a banning order issued by the US last week.
The move is a big setback for Huawei, which was dealt a series of blows yesterday when four big mobile operators in Japan and the UK pulled planned launches of new Huawei smartphones due to the US banning order.
Arm is not a US company but its designs include intellectual property from a number of US companies that it has acquired.
Arm said its designs contained “US origin technology”, making them subject to the export controls.
Huawei had planned to increase production of its own chips after the news of the ban, which has cut it off from microprocessors made by US chipmakers Qualcomm and Intel.
Huawei’s chip design unit HiSilicon employs 7,000 people and has produced a range of smartphone chips, many of which are manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan.
But these designs rely heavily on Arm’s technology.
“There really isn’t anybody out there who does what Arm does. The time to create a working processor from scratch, particularly of the complexity of Arm processors, is measured in years and hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Scott Hover-Smoot, general counsel at chipmaker Graphcore.
In February, Arm chief executive Simon Segars defended his company’s work with Huawei, telling reporters that Huawei’s chip designs had become “very sophisticated” and that its design team was now “world class”.
The Financial Times reported this month that Huawei was building a 400-person chip research and development factory outside Cambridge, just a 15-minute drive from the headquarters of Arm Holdings.
The two companies were reported to be working closely on innovation.
Google this week warned Huawei it would have to stop licensing its Android operating system for use in the Chinese company’s phones.
In response, four mobile operators — BT’s EE and Vodafone in the UK, and Japan’s SoftBank and KDDI — yesterday pulled Huawei handsets from their proposed 5G mobile services.
Marc Allera, chief executive of BT consumer, said it had to “pause” the launch due to the uncertainty.
Vodafone said that despite listing a Huawei phone in its 5G launch plans two weeks ago, the handset was “yet to receive the necessary certifications”.
A Huawei spokesperson said: “We value our close relationships with our partners, but recognise the pressure some of them are under as a result of politically motivated decisions. We are confident this regrettable situation can be resolved.”

Michael Bloomberg’s New Economy Forum, a conference launched by the billionaire to debate how the shifting balance of power between the US and China affects business, has been invited to Beijing, months after the trade war between the countries forced the inaugural event to relocate to Singapore.
“The fact the meeting is taking place in Beijing is a positive sign and a sign China remains interested in a dialogue,” said Henry Kissinger, an adviser to the event.
Mr Kissinger was Richard Nixon’s national security adviser, who laid the groundwork for the 1972 presidential visit that marked China’s opening to the west.
“The Chinese leadership in my view are pleased with this process,” he said of the chance the forum would give for western business leaders to meet Chinese officials and chief executives.
Mr Bloomberg, owner of the eponymous financial information provider and former mayor of New York City, told the Financial Times he thought current trade tensions were “short-term stuff”. The 400 executives and officials from 60 countries due to attend November’s event were focused on longer-term trends, he said.
Political tensions would not deter businesses from needing to understand China and other rising economic powers from Africa to Latin America,” he added. “There are forces bigger than government and that is the economy.”
His point was echoed by Jorge Paolo Lemann, a co-founder of the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, who said the forum’s first event had given him a rare opportunity to meet leaders of China’s technology industry. “I’m in favour of business and always had my doubts about people in government getting things done,” he said. The forum will be co-hosted by Zeng Peiyan, a former vice premier of the Chinese government’s State Council, now chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchange, a “think-tank with Chinese characteristics”.
Hank Paulson, the former US Treasury Secretary who is also among the forum’s advisers, warned at the first event in Singapore that there was a risk of “an economic iron curtain” dividing the world if the US and China could not resolve their differences.
That risk remained “a real possibility”, he told the FT yesterday, but Beijing’s invitation to the forum was a positive sign.
“I know that China takes this very seriously and is going to be very supportive at the highest level,” he said.
“More broadly, I think this is about, how do governments engage businesses to a greater degree, because they need to be part of this process.”
The event comes at a time of growing debate about whether the west’s prevailing capitalist model needs reform.
The forum’s guests were “card-carrying capitalists”, Mr Paulson said, but were also “realists” and aware of the data showing rising economic inequality.
“I think there’s a real view from many American companies, from me and others . . . that capitalism needs to be adjusted, that it’s not working as well as it needs to work for many Americans,” he said.
“I think there’s a realisation all around the world that economic policies need to be adjusted . . . Prosperity’s got to be spread more widely.”
Mr Bloomberg said the fundamentals of capitalism were still strong but there was a rebellion against “the intelligentsia” in many democracies.
“I’m not so sure that capitalism is as much at threat as democracy is,” he said.
The New Economy Forum will make a profit for his company, Mr Bloomberg said, and deepen its relationship with prominent customers. After “a hiccup” in 2013 when Beijing punished Bloomberg reporters after its news service published details about the alleged wealth of President Xi Jinping’s relatives, sales of its terminals were growing “very rapidly” in China, he said.

The latest Avengers film has become China’s highest-grossing foreign movie, but it is not all down to the global appeal of the Hollywood franchise.
After a decade of rapid expansion in China’s movie market, local film producers are facing a funding crunch.
A government crackdown on tax evasion, a squeeze on the shadow banking sector and a pullback in consumer spending have hit new projects.
The movies in the latest week’s box office top five in China were all foreign.
At Beijing’s annual film festival last month, the atmosphere was gloomy.
“The era of barbaric growth has ended,” said Lin Zhan, chair of a committee that organised the event.
China’s largest film production company, Huayi Brothers, had its first unprofitable year in a decade in 2018, with a loss of Rmb1.09bn （$162m）.
Profits at all but three of China’s 14 other listed film and TV groups fell last year.
The downturn is a stark reversal after a multiyear boom in film investment.
Ran Wang, founder of private equity group CEC Capital, estimated that Rmb180bn flowed into China’s 400 largest film and TV companies between 2014 and 2018.
The investment mania saw dozens of investors including Alibaba, real estate developers and even a hospital management group team up to spend $100m on fantasy epic Asura.
But China’s biggest-budget film flopped and was pulled from cinemas last summer after making just $7.3m in its opening weekend.
Last summer also saw China’s highest-earning actress, Fan Bingbing, disappear from public view for three months after being accused of evading tax on film contracts.
She re-emerged in October, promising to pay back-taxes and fines of Rmb850m.
The episode was part of a broad tax crackdown across the industry on what was thought to be a widespread practice of income tax avoidance — a clampdown that coincided with a slowdown in domestic consumer spending.
The film industry has paid more than Rmb11bn in fines and back taxes, and new regulations governing small production companies could result in them paying 20 per cent of their income in taxes, up from 3 per cent previously.
“The tax investigations and economic pessimism are deterring investment,” said a film industry executive in Beijing. “I am expecting a two-year cooling off period, with fewer films and more low- and medium-budget films.”
One cause of the economic slowdown — Beijing’s efforts to rein in financial risk — hit filmmakers hard.
They had come to rely on the influx of capital from the shadow banking industry, a network of loosely regulated lending outside the conventional banking sector.
Dozens of private equity funds have shut down over the past year as shadow banking has cooled.
“The hot money has left the industry,” said a Beijing-based executive with a British studio.
With financing shrivelling, at least a quarter of China’s roughly 12,000 entertainment companies will be forced out of business this year, CEC’s Mr Ran told an industry conference in December.
Domestic filmmakers could face a vicious cycle as a dearth of new releases further squeezes income.
China’s box office revenues fell 9 per cent year on year in the first quarter, a slump analysts blamed on a lack of quality domestic movies.
“The industry is at a turning point: films need to be bigger to compete with Hollywood,” said Chris Bremble founder of Beijing based film company Base FX.
Last year, three of the four top grossing Chinese films boasted budgets over $60m, including the CGI-filled fantasy drama Monster Hunt 2 and naval adventure Operation Red Sea.
This year, just two big-budget Chinese films are expected: second world war-themed 800, and Rescue, about the Chinese coastguard.
In the short term, the decline in domestic productions will benefit foreign filmmakers.
Nearly 100 overseas films were screened in China last year, up nearly a third from the previous year.
China officially has an annual quota of 38 foreign films that are allowed to be shown in the country on lucrative revenue-sharing terms, but in practice there are few limits on movies whose rights are purchased for a one-off fee.
China Minsheng Bank predicts film imports will rise 30 per cent this year.
That is likely to alarm Beijing, which has exhorted filmmakers to turn the country into a “strong film power” to rival the US by 2035 and targeted the production of 100 movies a year that each earn more than Rmb100m.
Ms Fan made her first public appearance last month, indicating the worst of the tax crackdown has passed.
But the importance of star appeal in China means the cost of paying full taxes on acting fees will fall on studios.
“If you are a very good actor in high demand, then the costs will increase. That’s one reason why it’s difficult for productions to carry on,” said Philip Lee, a producer working on a $120m disaster movie for Chinese audiences.
Industry executives say the hope is that the funding slowdown will prompt investors to demand tighter control over budgets.
“Those who should not be in the movie industry have left and those who remain should be serious film makers,” said Mr Lee.

Boeing faces a crucial test this week as global regulators meet in Texas to determine when the grounded 737 Max aircraft will return to the air, after further revelations of problems with software used to train pilots to fly the aircraft.
The world’s largest commercial aircraft manufacturer revealed at the weekend that it had been forced to correct a flaw in the software of flight-training simulators that are meant to reproduce the flying conditions of the Max aircraft involved in two deadly crashes in the past six months.
The disclosure is a further blow to Boeing’s credibility, which has been seriously damaged by the two crashes, in which 346 people died.
Subsequent disclosures of serious design flaws both in the Max’s anti-stall system, called the manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system （MCAS）, and errors involving other safety systems have further undermined the reputation of the Chicago-based company.
This Thursday, nine global aviation regulators, including those from China, the EU, Canada and Brazil, will meet to review Boeing's application to get the Max back in the air.
The aircraft maker has said it has completed work on a software fix aimed at preventing future disasters caused by the MCAS system.
But Boeing has said it is still answering questions from the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, ahead of formally submitting the fix to the FAA.
All of the nearly 400 Boeing 737 Max aircraft were grounded by global regulators after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on March 10.
The FAA, which organised the Texas meeting, said it does not need the agreement of other regulators before it approves Boeing's application.
But officials say they want to avoid a repeat of what happened after the Ethiopian crash, when China grounded the aircraft before any other regulator and before analysing the flight data.
US officials said China’s action was premature and undermined confidence in the global system of aviation regulation, and they want to make sure countries worldwide act together when allowing the Max back into their airspace.
People close to the meeting of regulators said they do not think an official timetable will come out of it, but the FAA was likely to inform other regulators that it hoped to conduct a crucial certification flight for the software fix by the end of May or early June, with full FAA certification before the end of June.
The FAA may be able to persuade Canadian and European regulators to adhere to that timetable, but China is expected to seek a delay.
Boeing said in a statement on Sunday: “We are providing the FAA and global regulators, as well as pilots and airlines, whatever information they need to restore their confidence in the MAX and safely return the aircraft to flight.”
On Saturday, Boeing said that software used on the Max training simulator was unable to reproduce some flight conditions, including the conditions which led to the crash of the Ethiopian flight.
The preliminary crash report from the Ethiopian authorities revealed that the pilots of that flight were flying at relatively high speed and were unable to overcome the power of the MCAS system.

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi is poised to romp back to power and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is likely to emerge as the largest party in parliament, according to exit polls following the end of a bruising general election.
The exit polls were released last night after voting in the seventh and final phase of a protracted election that began on April 11.
Around 900m people were eligible to cast ballots during the mammoth process.
The contest was framed as a referendum on Mr Modi’s leadership, as he sought another five-year mandate to continue his efforts to build a “New India”.
Exit polls indicated that the BJP — riding on Mr Modi’s image as hard-working, incorruptible and well-intentioned — and its allies would secure a majority of parliamentary seats, trouncing rivals including the opposition Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi.
But the polls were divided on whether the BJP would secure a parliamentary majority on its own, as it did in a dramatic sweep in 2014, or would have to rely on allies to form an administration.
Indian exit polls have a mixed record — in both numerical accuracy and detecting major electoral trends.
In 2014, pollsters correctly predicted a victory for Mr Modi’s BJP but few forecast its full magnitude.
But in 2004, no pollsters predicted that Congress would claw back to power after a stunning upset victory.
However, India’s informal betting market, another closely watched indicator of popular sentiment, predicted on Friday that the BJP and its allies would win a majority.
If the predictions are confirmed when the votes are counted on Thursday, it will be an extraordinary personal victory for Mr Modi, highlighting the formidable political skills that allow him to remain popular despite his patchy economic record.
Addressing journalists after campaigning ended on Friday, Mr Modi, predicting victory, vowed to take charge “as soon as possible” and immediately “take decisions one after another”.
“A government with full majority is coming back after remaining in power for five years,” the premier said.
“This is probably happening after a very long time.”
Mr Gandhi had been cautious on Friday, saying he would “not disrespect the people of this country by judging what they are going to do”.
But in a tweet after the polls closed, Mr Gandhi lashed out at the independent Election Commission of India which has been repeatedly criticised for turning a blind eye to government violations of electoral protocol.
“The Election Commissions capitulation before Mr Modi & his gang is obvious to all Indians,” the opposition leader tweeted.
“The EC used to be feared and respected. Not any more.”
The prime minister, seeking re-election against the backdrop of acute agrarian distress and widespread youth joblessness, shied away during the campaign from scrutiny of his economic record.
Instead, Mr Modi, who addressed 142 rallies and logged 150,000 kms of air travel, focused primarily on national security issues .
In his final rally in Madhya Pradesh, Mr Modi told voters they should support the BJP, which uses the Lotus as its party symbol, if they wanted to vanquish India’s enemies.
“When you vote for the Lotus you are not pushing a button on a [voting] machine, but pressing a trigger to shoot terrorists in the chest,” he told supporters.

Huawei’s chipmaking arm said it had turned its “Plan Bs into Plan As overnight” a day after the Trump administration raised the prospect of a US ban on export of parts and components to the Chinese telecoms group.
The Shenzhen-based company is already largely shut out of selling into the US market and has been ramping up its self-sufficiency — along with other Chinese tech groups — ever since Washington imposed a similar export ban on smaller rival ZTE.
That in turn has stoked what some critics describe as the unintended consequence of Washington’s actions: pushing Chinese tech companies to accelerate their own capacity rather than tamping them down.
In an internal memo to employees seen by the Financial Times, He Tingbo, chief executive of HiSilicon, Huawei’s wholly owned semiconductor subsidiary, wrote: “All the spare tyres we have built have turned to Plan A overnight.”
Ms He added: “Today, the circle of destiny turns to this extreme and dark moment, the Superpower has mercilessly interrupted the technical and industrial system of global co-operation, made the most insane decision, put Huawei into the Entity List with no founded basis.”
The US Department of Commerce on Thursday said it would put Huawei on its so-called Entity List, meaning that US companies will have to obtain a licence from Washington to sell technology to Huawei.
At the same time, US president Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring the US telecoms sector faced a “national emergency” — giving the commerce department the power to “prohibit transactions posing an unacceptable risk” to national security.
When ZTE was hit by an export ban last year, after violating penalties meted out for sanction-busting sales to Iran, it was forced to shut down production for several months.
Chinese tech company executives described the move as a “wake up” call that the US could pull the rug from under vital components — and ramped up their efforts to increase their own self-reliance.
Alibaba is developing superfast quantum computers and aims to have its first artificial intelligence chips on the market next year.
Several homegrown companies, including Shenzhen-based Cambricon Technologies, have also sprouted to develop AI chipsets.
The resetting of the corporate landscape — both in China and in the US, where chipmakers are also fretting about the impact of losing a big buyer — is coming as the trade wars and Huawei-specific moves prompt a rethink on supply chains.
At the heart of the US-China spat, which embraces concerns over backdoors at Huawei, intellectual property theft and the trade surplus, many see a broader fear at China’s rising tech prowess.
Huawei rotating chairman Ken Hu wrote in a memo sent to employees on Thursday that the company had expected difficulties with the US “many years ago” and had invested heavily in research and development as a precaution.
“[We] can ensure that in extreme cases the company’s operations will not be much affected,” Mr Hu said.

President Donald Trump warned Tehran to stop threatening America and suggested the US would destroy the Islamic Republic if there was a military conflict, in comments that once again raised the spectre of war in the Middle East.
“If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!” Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday.
Mr Trump has maintained a hardline stance towards the Iranian leadership since taking office, including his decision a year ago to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement.
Over the past few weeks, his team has struck an even tougher note, citing unreleased intelligence about possible attacks on US forces in the region.
The US last week said it would withdraw all non-essential personnel from its diplomatic missions in Iraq, sparking fears that Mr Trump was preparing to take military action.
That move came a week after John Bolton, the US national security adviser who called for regime change as a private citizen, said the US would send an aircraft carrier group with accompanying warships and B-52 bombers to the Middle East.
It was unclear if Mr Trump on Sunday was referring to a rocket attack on the area in Baghdad that houses the US embassy.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr Trump said last July that Iran would “suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered” if it threatened the US.
Mr Trump has kept Tehran on edge in recent weeks by mixing threats with statements downplaying the odds of war.
Asked on Thursday if the US was heading for military conflict with Iran, Mr Trump responded: “I hope not”.

The unnerving thing about America’s trade war against China is that it is just the start.
Donald Trump is fixated on trade balances and tariffs.
The US president hankers for the 1950s, when US industry swept aside all before it.
Among the swelling community of China hawks in Washington, however, resetting the terms of trade is only an opening shot.
While American and Chinese negotiators were trying and failing to reach a trade deal last week, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, was visiting London.
His message to Theresa May’s government?
Allow China’s Huawei to build any of Britain’s next generation, or 5G, communications network and you can say goodbye to the special relationship.
Back in Washington, Mr Trump announced new measures to effectively ban Huawei from selling technology into the American market and may also prevent it from buying US semiconductors that are crucial for its production.
Six thousand miles away, US warships were steaming through the South China Sea.
At the head of a small flotilla of Japanese, Philippine and Indian vessels, the US navy raised another banner.
As much as China turns disputed rocks into military outposts to stake its claim to the waters, the US will respond with more freedom of navigation patrols.
Prominent Republicans, meanwhile, were lending support to a new anti-Beijing lobby group.
The Committee on the Present Danger: China invokes the cold war against the Soviet Union.
The Texan senator Ted Cruz, his colleague Marco Rubio from Florida, and Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, are among those echoing its warnings that China has started a new arms race.
Mr Trump says he hopes to patch something up on trade with Chinese president Xi Jinping when the two meet at the G20 summit in Japan next month.
The China hawks have moved on from tariffs.
They want essentially to decouple the two nations’ economies.
The president has leaned in this direction with tighter controls on Chinese investment in sensitive sectors of the US economy and new restrictions on Chinese students at US universities. Mr Trump’s answer to complaints that high tariffs are hitting US companies with plants in China is straightforward. Bring the production home. Disentangling American and Chinese supply chains would restore national independence.
Until quite recently, China was viewed as an economic competitor playing an unfair game.
It cheated the system by manipulating trade and investment rules, forcing technology transfer from western partners and stealing intellectual property.
In the US, the anger at such practices has been widely shared by Democrats as well as Republicans.
Europeans have voiced the same irritation with China’s restrictive investment conditions and asymmetric trade rules.
The trade narrative is now being subsumed into a much more alarming one.
Economics has merged with geopolitics.
China, you can hear on almost every corner in sight of the White House and Congress, is not just a dangerous economic competitor but a looming existential threat.
Beijing may not have the same ideological ambitions as the Soviet Union, but it does threaten US primacy.
It needs more than a level playing field for trade to confront this challenge.
The shift was foreshadowed in Mr Trump’s National Security Strategy and in the National Defence Strategy produced by the Pentagon. “China is using economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, and implied military threats to persuade other states to heed its political and security agenda,” the first document says. As for the South China Sea: “China has mounted a rapid military modernisation campaign designed to limit US access to the region and provide China a freer hand there.”
The defence strategy aims to dispel any doubt. “For decades, US policy was rooted in the belief that support for China’s rise and for its integration into the postwar international order would liberalise China. Contrary to our hopes, China expanded its power at the expense of the sovereignty of others. China . . . is building the most capable and well-funded military in the world, after our own”. The goal, the Pentagon says, is, “Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global pre-eminence in the future”.
The irony is that Mr Trump’s focus on the nuts and bolts of trade during 11 rounds of talks between Washington and Beijing, and his habit of showering compliments on Mr Xi, has obscured this profound shift in US policy.
Nothing stirs US neuralgia so much as technology.
Beyond the temporary jolt delivered by losing the space race to the Soviet Union during the 1950s, the US has been consistently confident of its technological lead over adversaries.
No longer.
At a recent gathering of US policymakers and experts, speaker after speaker took to the podium to voice fears that China is stealing a march in harnessing 5G digital technology and artificial intelligence applications to its military ambitions.
The danger in all this speaks for itself.
Treating China as a certain enemy is a sure way to persuade Beijing that it should behave as such.
Mistrust begets mistrust, which in turn could provide the spark for open conflict.
China is no innocent — witness the ever present cyber attacks on western militaries and vital infrastructure.
But demonising everything it does simply opens up the path from a trade war to something much rougher.
What the two nations need above all are common rules of the road to avoid escalation.
Otherwise we are heading towards an altogether hotter war.

Japanese gross domestic product unexpectedly grew in the first quarter of year, as the world’s third-largest economy was boosted by better-than-expected exports.
Data released by the country’s Cabinet Office on Monday showed that annualised  growth in Japan came in at 2.1 per cent in the January to March period.
That figure was in stark contrast to the 0.2 per cent contraction in growth predicted by economists polled by Reuters, and above the 1.6 per cent expansion rate registered in the fourth quarter.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the Japanese economy grew by 0.5 per cent, versus economists’ forecasts of flat growth.
“What saved the day though was a 0.4 percentage point boost from net exports. While real export volumes dropped by 2.4% quarter on quarter real imports plunged by a larger 4.6%,” said Marcel Thielant, economist with Capital Economics.
A stronger-than-expected Japanese economy could provide the government with ammunition to progress with an unpopular hike in the country’s sales tax from 8 per cent to 10 per cent, currently scheduled for October. A similar rise from 5 per cent to 8 per cent in 2014 pushed the economy into a  recession.
Japan’s fragile economy has also been given respite from US President Donald Trump deferring a  decision to impose tariffs on cars and auto part imports from the country by up to six months.
The first report of Japan’s GDP can be unreliable because it is based on limited source data.
The second reading, due on June 10, often leads to large revisions.

With China poised to destroy a third of its pig herd due to African swine fever, a Hong Kong-based entrepreneur ishoping to step into the gap with a plant-based pork product he hopes will replicate the success of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.
David Yeung, founder of Hong Kong-based Right Treat, said he developed Omnipork from peas, soy and mushroom proteins to provide Asian chefs with a more environmentally friendly alternative to pork, and now plans to launch it in China.
“When Asian consumers go to the wet market or supermarket to buy meat, they turn it into their own dish — it is not a finished product,” Mr Yeung said, unlike some western ready-to-eat meat alternatives such as burgers or sausages.
“For chefs, pork is almost like a foundation ingredient in whatever they cook.”
He said Omnipork was designed to replace pork in Asian cuisine, such as in dumplings, where it acts as a binding ingredient to which chefs add mushrooms or other vegetables.
First launched in restaurants in Hong Kong in April 2018, Omnipork is now sold in Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
May Chow, chef-owner of Little Bao and Happy Paradise Hong Kong, has been using Impossible Foods products in her restaurants for a year and said her customers were opting to eat less meat. In terms of meat alternatives in Asia, Ms Chow said familiarity was a crucial factor, so a replacement for pork would appeal more to a Chinese home cook.
Omnipork’s China launch — planned for the latter half of this year — comes as China’s pig farms have been hit by African swine fever.
The country is expected to lose 130 million animals to the disease that is fatal to pigs and has no cure.
Swine fever has already pushed up retail pork prices in China, and Nomura forecasts prices will rise by a further 40 per cent in the next six months.
“I’m not a genius, I don’t have a crystal ball, but I would never expect that the year we launched Omnipork would be the year that the African swine fever outbreak would happen,” Mr Yeung said.
“But I did know this breaking point [for agriculture] would happen.”
Consumers globally are warming to plant-based meat substitutes as they look for more sustainable sources of protein.
Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat shares more than doubled on their debut at the beginning of May, and Impossible Foods raised a further $300m in its latest funding round, taking its valuation to $2bn.
And that trend is not limited to North America and Europe.
The ranks of Asia-Pacific’s vegetarians rose to 496m in 2018, up from 488.5m in 2014, according to market research provider Euromonitor International.
India makes up the bulk of that population, with 397m vegetarians, while China is home to 56.7m.
Euromonitor forecasts that the Asia-Pacific will account for three-quarters of the global market for meat substitutes in 2023 at $17.4bn — from $15.2bn in 2018.
China’s 1.4bn people consumed 55m tonnes of pork in 2017, according to OECD data, making the market for pork substitutes potentially very lucrative.

Since the global financial crisis, brokers and their research teams have been flogging the happy story of rising employment, swelling income and the boom in both high-end and middle-class consumption in emerging Asia, particularly in China.
Companies producing everything from Maotai to Mercedes have been big beneficiaries of the strong economic growth that put more money in everyone’s pockets.
Hence the giant share-price rallies for companies such as Beijing-based GigaDevice Semiconductor, a chipmaker that ranks among the top handful of performers on the Chinese market, up almost 900 per cent over the past five years.
But this positive tale could now be changing.
A new study from JPMorgan suggests that economic growth in the region no longer means ever-increasing amounts of jobs and rising wages.
“Asia has been weakening. The transmission from [gross domestic product] growth into employment and labour incomes in EM Asia” has broken down, writes Sin Beng Ong, the report’s author.
That is at least partly because most of the jobs being created in China and elsewhere in Asia tend to be low-end service jobs with limited prospects for upward mobility, such as working as a delivery person for e-commerce companies.
These trends have especially important implications for China, the world’s second-largest economy, where consumption has been a particularly strong source of growth in recent years.
A weakening in consumer spending — Chinese retail sales grew at their slowest pace in nearly 16 years in April — is particularly unfortunate, coming just as trade friction suggests manufacturing for exports is also fading as an engine of growth.
Rising consumer spending was one of the main catalysts for the country’s stock market, which has done about three times better than the MSCI EM index, in renminbi terms, over the past five years.
It is unclear what particular theme could propel shares much higher from here.
Technology shares, for example, are already under pressure, in part from the contagion effects of counterparts such as Uber and Lyft across the Pacific.
“There is less room for income growth in China,” says Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JPMorgan. “Consumption will slow down by 1 to 2 percentage points every two or three years.”
Moreover, that slowdown in job growth and wages comes at the same time as household debt is increasing dramatically, adding another headwind.
In 2017, for example, consumption accounted for two-thirds of growth in GDP, supported not only by rising wages but also rising asset prices, especially of property.
In addition, credit was more widely available, whether via banks or alternative sources such as “peer-to-peer” lenders.
Back in 2013, the ratio of household debt to GDP, including mortgages, amounted to a relatively modest 30 per cent.
But last year it was up at about 53 per cent of GDP, according to data from Gavekal, a research boutique in Beijing.
（And since the data capture bank lending only, the number could be understated.
“Household debt is the single largest component of new credit in the banking system,” notes Fitch, the rating agency, which predicts that China’s ratio of household debt to disposable income could exceed 100 per cent by 2020.
That would make the once-frugal Chinese people almost as profligate as counterparts in the US, where the ratio is 105 per cent.
That mounting debt could have secondary effects on other sectors, notably property. “Housing sales are unlikely to have another boom like that in 2015-2017, because mortgage growth will not be that strong,” warns Chen Long, China economist at Gavekal. “It [also] means that housing prices in expensive cities may not see another boom, because of the limited potential for households in these areas to take on more debt . . . Most importantly, it means that if policymakers want to keep economic growth high, then the corporate and government sectors will have to take on more debt to offset the slowdown in household leverage.”
Beijing has room to stimulate the economy and has done so by cutting taxes on both companies and households.
Economists at Deutsche Bank estimate that the fiscal stimulus this year will amount to about Rmb500-600bn, equivalent to about 0.5 per cent of GDP and 1.2 per cent of household disposable income.
That, says Deutsche, could boost retail sales by about 1 per cent, if people were to spend most of their tax savings on consumption.
That could help to offset ill-effects from the trade war, and keep overall economic growth this year above 6 per cent.
Economists at CICC, a Beijing-based investment bank, go further, saying that tax-relief measures that took effect at the start of this year could boost the economy by about 2 per cent of disposable income.
All this suggests, in a way, that China is becoming more like a developed economy, where people are spending more （with borrowed money） and saving less.
For investors though, the outlook is murkier.
Perhaps a better bet for the next five years: shares in debt-collection agencies.

Robust computer sales helped Lenovo more than triple its quarterly profits, providing a silver lining for China’s under-fire technology sector.
The Beijing-based company said Thursday that profits attributable to equity holders surged to $118m in the three months to March, compared to just $33m in the year ago period.
Fourth quarter profits were also ahead of the $106m figure forecast by analysts polled by Bloomberg.
Quarterly revenues of $11.7bn were 10 per cent higher year-on-year and a touch above analyst estimates of $11.6bn.
The company attributed the performance to strong growth in sales in both its traditional PC and data centre businesses.
Late last year the company re-captured the number one spot in terms of global personal computer shipments.
For the company’s entire fiscal year, net profit came in at $597 million versus a loss of $189 million the previous year.
Revenue was up 13 per cent to $51 billion.
Lenovo’s improving fortunes stand in contrast to those of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, which was  effectively banned from selling technology into the American market and from buying components from US suppliers.

Taiwan has legalised same-sex marriage, making it the first Asian jurisdiction  to allow the unions.
Taiwanese lawmakers  backed a bill on Friday allowing same-sex couples to form “intimate, exclusive, permanent relationships” and to register marriages with the government.
The vote followed a ruling by Taiwan’s constitutional court in May 2017 that existing laws stipulating that a marriage must be between a man and a woman were unconstitutional.
Parliament had two years to bring in a change to the law.
Opponents had pushed back against any changes with a series of referendums on the topic in November, which saw Taiwanese signal their support for restrictions on same-sex marriage.
“We took a big step towards true equality, and made Taiwan a better country,” Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen said on Twitter following the vote.
On Friday morning, Ms Tsai had said Taiwan had “a chance to make history”.
Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, hosts Asia’s largest gay pride parade, but some Christian groups had becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition to same-sex unions.

This week, a frisson passed through Treasury markets when it emerged that China has been selling US government bonds.
These sales were not huge — a mere $20.5bn in March — nor were they made with accompanying public threats.
But in the current protectionist climate, the news left investors pondering two unnerving questions.
Could the current trade war turn into a capital and currency war?
And if so, might that undermine the dominance of the US dollar?
The answer to the first question is, “one hopes not”.
And to the second, “almost certainly no”.
The reasons for this were neatly laid out at a meeting of central bankers earlier this week in Zurich, organised by the IMF and Swiss National Bank.
This started with a paper from Barry Eichengreen, the American economist, outlining a split among academics in the US about the way the dollar has in effect anchored the international monetary system （it accounts for about 60 per cent of foreign exchange reserves, foreign currency liabilities and bank deposits）.
Prof Eichengreen noted that at the University of California, Berkeley, where he teaches, economists tend to assume that dollar dominance will eventually end.
Other currencies （or metals） have been dominant in the past — sterling in the 19th century, say.
However, a little-noticed feature of these earlier eras was that dominance almost always occurred within a multipolar global system.
The Berkeley economists assume that the world will eventually become multipolar again, particularly as the current status quo does not serve anybody well.
Most notably, emerging markets are laden with alarmingly large levels of dollar-denominated debt.
And while US leaders like the political status and power associated with the dollar’s dominant role, it has some negative consequences for America’s domestic economy too.
It fosters an excessively strong currency and artificially low levels of market interest rates.
But “eventually” is the keyword here.
Even Prof Eichengreen does not predict that the dollar will lose its dominance in the near future.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the US at Harvard University, a group of economists, including Gita Gopinath （now chief economist at the IMF）, have recently developed some powerful empirical arguments for why dollar supremacy is “sticky”.
Currently, the dollar is the dominant currency for trade invoices （if you exclude euro-denominated payments inside the eurozone） and that encourages debt issuance in dollars too.
Taken together, these factors create an overwhelming dollar tilt that is difficult to shift, particularly since the Chinese currency is not yet liberalised and markets in the eurozone remain disunited.
The case of Russia demonstrates this “stickiness”.
At first glance, Moscow seems to be trying to escape the dollar yoke.
At the IMF-SNB meeting Elvira Nabiullina, Russia’s central bank governor, revealed that between July 2017 and July 2018 Russia cut the dollar proportion of its foreign exchange reserves from 46.3 per cent to 21.9 per cent, replacing these with euros and some Chinese renminbi.
That might seem to make sense given Russia’s trading patterns: commerce with America accounts for a measly 1.5 per cent of Russian gross domestic product, whereas trade with the EU and China is a whopping 24.3 per cent of GDP.
But here is the catch: measured overall, 55 per cent of Russia’s trade is still invoiced in dollars, Ms Nabiullina noted.
And since Russian companies （sensibly） try to match liabilities and revenues, 54 per cent of Russian debt is dollar-denominated too.
Now, a critic of America might point out that Russia is an extreme case — it is highly dependent on commodity exports, which tend to be priced in dollars.
But the global pattern is clear.
And what was striking about the IMF/SNB event was that while almost all the central bank governors from emerging market countries fretted about the pain the dollar yoke creates, none predicted it was about to vanish.
However, there was also an interesting caveat. This, the ninth such meeting, was the first to include representatives of fintech companies, who boldly predicted that technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies are poised to overturn global finance. Unsurprisingly, the central bankers were not convinced, but they did not dismiss the fintech claims out of hand.
So if you want to see what might eventually challenge dollar supremacy, look to Silicon Valley as much as China.
Just don’t expect that change too soon, even amid a trade war.

Baidu, China's top search engine, posted its first loss as a listed company in the three months to March, warning that a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy was threatening its online advertising business.
The company, dubbed China’s Google and once one of the three titans of China’s tech scene before falling rapidly behind Alibaba and Tencent, also announced the departure of the head of its search business, 14-year Baidu veteran Hailong Xiang.
Plans for a $1bn share buyback programme were not enough arrest a steep drop in the group’s American Depositary Receipts, which plunged 9.7 per cent in after-hours trading.
The company's net loss was Rmb327bn （$3.59bn） for the three first three months of the year, the first time the search company has posted a loss since going public in 2005, according to Bloomberg data.
“With the resignation of [Mr Xiang] . . . and a US$1bn share buyback programme initiated, together with softer-than-expected 2Q guidance, it seems like Baidu is facing multiple headwinds in addition to macro weakness,” Citi analyst Alicia Yap wrote in a research note to clients.
Revenues grew 15 per cent to Rmb24.1bn, slightly less than analysts' expectations,
The majority of Baidu's revenues are driven by advertising on its online search platform.
Online marketing accounted for 73 per cent of its total revenues in the first quarter.
The company forecast second-quarter revenues may drop to as low as Rmb25.1bn, which would be a 3 per cent fall on a year earlier.
“Despite government policies to improve the market condition for SMEs, we anticipate online marketing in the near term to face a challenging environment,” Herman Yu, Baidu’s finance chief, said in a statement.
The company, which is behind livestreaming group iQiyi, faces growing competition from video apps run by Tencent as well as start-ups like ByteDance, which hosts wildly popular short videos.
The 19-year-old search company has also been  slow to tap into China's rocketing mobile usage.
Two of its main competitors,  Tencent and  Alibaba, posted robust results on Wednesday despite the slowdown in the Chinese economy.

China’s former top securities regulator is being investigated by the country’s corruption watchdog just months after leaving the job.
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said late on Sunday that Liu Shiyu, head of China’s securities regulator until January, was suspected of “violating laws and regulations”, a phrase often used in corruption probes in China.
The 57-year-old turned himself in, the CCDI said in a short note on its website, and was co-operating with the investigation.
It did not give other details related to the case.
Mr Liu led the China Securities Regulatory Commission from early 2016 to January this year, ending his tenure with one the worst market performances in several years.
Negative sentiment and a tightening of liquidity made China’s stock market the world’s poorest-performing big market in 2018.
A former banker, Mr Liu was known as an outspoken critic of unruly players in the market, at one point referring to companies engaged in hostile takeover activity as barbarians.
When groups such as Anbang Insurance were spending billions of dollars on overseas acquisitions, Mr Liu publicly accused some companies of borrowing and investing recklessly, without naming specific insurers.
He also once publicly criticised listed firms that refused to pay dividends to investors.
Maintaining stability in China’s markets is one of the top priorities of the country’s leadership.
Those who threaten market stability have often faced harsh punishment.
The CCDI, China’s top corruption watchdog, has been at the forefront of a years-long anti-corruption campaign that has seen many of Chinese president Xi Jinping’s rivals investigated and often penalised.
Mr Xi has vowed to rid the Communist party of both high- and low-raking corrupt officials — in his words, “tigers and flies” — although the campaign has slowed over the past year.
Officials formally investigated by the CCDI tend to vanish from the public eye for six to 12 months before being expelled from the party and handed over to state prosecutors for a summary trial and conviction.
It is also possible for CCDI suspects to be later released without charge.
The previous regulatory head to be taken down in a corruption probe was Xiang Junbo, head of the insurance regulator and a technocrat whose policies at times clashed with those of Mr Liu’s.
Mr Xiang was detained in April 2017 and expelled from the party later that year.
Mr Liu served for many years at the People’s Bank of China and at Agricultural Bank of China.
He was replaced in January at the CSRC by Yi Huiman, the former chairman of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
Mr Liu’s most recent position was as deputy party secretary for the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Co-operatives.
He could not be reached for comment on the matter on Sunday.

Shares in some of Huawei’s biggest American suppliers fell on Thursday after the Trump administration ratcheted up attacks on the Chinese tech group.
The White House and US Department of Commerce took steps on Wednesday night that would in effect ban Huawei from selling technology into the American market, and could also prevent it from buying semiconductors from suppliers including Qualcomm in the US that are crucial for its production.
US chipmaker Qualcomm, which earns around 5 per cent of its revenues from Huawei, saw its share price drop almost 4 per cent to $83.08 by lunchtime in New York on Thursday despite a broadly positive market. Shares in Broadcom, another supplier, fell 2.5 per cent.
The Information Technology Industry Council, which represents Huawei suppliers Qualcomm, Intel and Microsoft, raised concerns about the US action and urged the administration to “work with industry” to minimise the fallout.
The US Department of Commerce said it would put Huawei on its so-called Entity List, meaning that the American companies will have to obtain a licence from the US government to sell technology to Huawei.
At the same time, US president Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring the US telecoms sector faced a “national emergency” — giving the commerce department the power to “prohibit transactions posing an unacceptable risk” to national security.
The increased pressure on Huawei comes just days after the US trade war with China escalated sharply, with Mr Trump raising tariffs on Chinese imports to 25 per cent and Beijing retaliating in kind.
Countries including Japan and Australia have banned Huawei — which is the frontrunner in building next-generation high-speed 5G networks around the world — and raised concerns that it could help the Chinese government conduct electronic espionage.
However, Washington is still struggling to persuade allies such as the UK and Germany to follow suit.
China’s foreign ministry on Thursday said it opposed Washington’s “abuse of export control measures”, saying Beijing would take “necessary measures” to safeguard its companies’ interests.
China also said it had formally charged two Canadians who were detained last year, in what Beijing-based diplomats labelled a reprisal for Canada’s arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.
The move delighted hawkish Republicans, who have campaigned for Mr Trump to take a tougher stance towards China.
Tom Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas, welcomed the decision, saying in a tweet: “@Huawei 5G, RIP. Thanks for playing.”
Samm Sacks, a cyber security and China expert at New America, a Washington-based think-tank, said placing Huawei on the blacklist was “the nuclear option” and would have “ripple effects” around the world.
Paul Triolo, a technology policy expert at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy, said it was a “huge development” that would not only hurt the Chinese company but also have an impact on global supply chains involving US companies such as Intel, Microsoft and Oracle.
“The US has basically openly declared it is willing to engage in a full-fledged technology war with China,” he said.
The Entity List is the Department of Commerce’s index of individuals, companies and other organisations seen as posing a risk to US national security.
While proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or terrorism are among the potential reasons for getting listed, the US government can also put companies on the list for unspecified risks to security or even just foreign policy goals of the country.
Although inclusion in the list is one step down from being designated a “Denied Person” — the total ban that was imposed last year on Chinese telecoms equipment company ZTE — US export control authorities say applications by US suppliers for licences to export to listed companies are “usually subject to a policy of denial”.
Don Vieira, a former top national security lawyer at the US justice department, said the moves suggested that the White House had given the intelligence agencies and commerce department a green light to “take on” Huawei.
“I don’t know if the US can destroy Huawei, but maybe the US government can get some concessions,” said Mr Vieira, a partner at the Skadden Arps law firm.
Huawei responded to the measures saying it was ready to engage with the US government to ensure the security of its products.
It said restricting Huawei raised “serious legal issues” and would “only serve to limit the US to inferior yet more expensive alternatives”.
Dennis Wilder, a former head of China analysis at the CIA, said the combination of the executive order and listing on the Entity List was part of a “full court press” against Huawei that represented “the beginning of decoupling” from Chinese telecoms.
Semiconductor industry executives and analysts said the impact of Huawei being put on the Entity List was unclear as it remained to be seen whether the US government was prepared to issue any licences for export to the company.

Huawei’s chief financial officer is in Canada facing extradition, the company is banned from selling its telecoms kit in the US and will now require the green light from Washington to buy parts and components from American companies such as Qualcomm.
Can the Chinese telecoms company weather this latest blow?
What’s the damage?
Threefold, said Edison Lee, an analyst at Jefferies, who sees it as possibly disrupting Huawei’s supply chain, delaying China’s 5G roll-out and even stymying last-minute trade talks.
On the first point, the precedent is pretty ugly.
When smaller rival ZTE was shut out of the US, its smartphone shipments plummeted by about 75 per cent and it blew a Rmb7.8bn （$1.1bn） hole in its bottom line in the first half of last year.
With revenues last year of $105bn, Huawei is a lot bigger than ZTE and its greater focus on telecoms infrastructure equipment and high-end phones means the impact of an export ban “would be material”, Credit Suisse analysts said in a report at the end of last year.
About 20 to 30 per cent of Huawei’s bill of materials is related to semiconductors, the analysts reckon, equivalent to $15bn worth of chips, or 3.8 per cent of global industry production versus just 0.5 per cent for ZTE.
The existence of Huawei-owned HiSilicon means it is highly unlikely to have to shut down production — the fate of ZTE for a few tense months — but it would need to look elsewhere to procure key components such as radiofrequency chips, important for high-end 4G products, which Huawei sources mainly from Qorvo and Skyworks.
Mark Li, an analyst at Bernstein, said alternative suppliers are limited but would include Murata of Japan.
Chips supplied by Intel and field-programmable gate arrays — chips that can be configured after the producer supplies them and that are vital for Huawei’s networking equipment products — could also be a bottleneck. Xilinx is Huawei’s main FPGA supplier.
Analysts said Huawei could also run into problems while continuing to use patents from Universal Display for its organic light-emitting diode displays, as well as mobile patents from Qualcomm and Google patents for the Android operating system in Huawei smartphones.
What has Huawei done to protect itself?
Huawei has had years to prepare for this, and is more cushioned than ZTE.
It has taken steps towards vertical integration; its fabless chip subsidiary HiSilicon designs chipsets — though it still relies on Taiwan’s TSMC to actually make them — and its 70-strong list of major suppliers is largely based in China.
Mr Lee reckoned that Huawei began building up inventories at the start of this year following the detention of Meng Wanzhou, its finance chief, initially targeting inventories of six to nine months’ supply, but subsequently raising that to one or even two years.
Beyond components such as FPGA and RF chips, some other parts of the supply chain may offer more alternatives.
“They buy from Micron but can substitute Korean Hynix/Micron and Invensense with some European sensor suppliers,” said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
Will being big help or hinder Huawei?
Huawei is the world’s biggest telecoms equipment manufacturer, with 28 per cent of the market, according to research company Dell’Oro, far ahead of its European competitors Ericsson and Nokia, and boasts more global 5G contracts than anyone else.
But as it sells more — it anticipates sales of $120bn this year — the company’s demand for parts is increasing.
This means its “dependency on external components is very high”, noted Bernstein’s Mr Li.
With the build-up of 5G and concomitant demand for components, it now buys or licenses from Intel, Qualcomm and Qorvo in the US, alternative suppliers in South Korea and Japan might face capacity limitations to act as substitutes, analysts said.
How bad is the risk of contagion?
Like the trade war, placing Huawei on the Entity List cuts both ways: US manufacturers lose a revenue stream. Qualcomm, in the throes of negotiating a final licence agreement with Huawei, booked $150m of royalties from the Chinese company in its latest quarter as a “minimum non-refundable” royalties payment while discussions continue.
While US national carriers have spurned Huawei for years, rural and enterprise networks have proved far less squeamish.
Thanks in part to hefty spending on research and development, Huawei produces kit that is seen by users as good quality and cheap.
Gordon Smith, who as chief executive of Sagent works with enterprises on their networks, said equipment in the sector typically has a shelf life of three to five years. If Huawei is not an option, companies will have to turn to the likes of Cisco and Juniper for routers and switches.
How will Beijing respond to the blacklisting?
China met Washington’s previous sabre-rattling at Huawei by singing the praises of its national champion at home.
It worked.
In the first quarter of the year Huawei grew sales in a declining market, shipping just shy of 30m smartphones to grab a 34 per cent market share, according to Canalys.
Few if any in China — and not an insignificant number in the US — see Washington’s fight with Huawei as purely concerned with national security but also as part of wider angst about trade with China and its rising tech prowess.
When asked about a possible Huawei ban on Wednesday, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: “The US has for a while abused its national strength to maliciously slander and press specific Chinese companies in an unscrupulous manner. This is not only dishonourable but also unjust.”

China has formally arrested two Canadians detained more than five months ago and accused them of state secrets violations, as it keeps up pressure on Ottawa in an escalating dispute over the future of telecommunications firm Huawei.
On Wednesday, US president Donald Trump banned Huawei from selling products in the US and required American firms to get a licence before selling to the Chinese company.
Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou is fighting extradition from Canada to the US on charges that her company violated US sanctions on Iran. China has frozen most contacts with Canadian diplomats and blocked shipments of canola, one of Canada’s most important export crops, in order to pressure the country to release Ms Meng, who is also the founder’s daughter.
Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat who worked for the International Crisis Group, is accused of spying and gathering intelligence on state secrets.
Michael Spavor, who arranged tours into North Korea, was accused of stealing and illegally providing state secrets.
The two Canadians were detained in China shortly after Canada arrested Ms Meng, late last year.
“We took enforcement measures against Canadian citizens you mentioned in accordance with the law. The procuratorate has now arrested them according to law. China has always acted in accordance with the law, and we hope that Canadian friends will not make irresponsible remarks on China’s judicial handling of cases,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters on Thursday.
He said they had been arrested “in recent days.”
The state secrets accusations keep the two men under the purview of the security apparatus, walled off from the relative transparency of China’s normal criminal procedures.
Under state secrets regulations, the security apparatus is under almost no legal obligation to provide evidence or even reveal details of the alleged crime to defence lawyers or judges.
While Ms Meng is allowed to move around Vancouver during the day pending her extradition, the two detained Canadians have been held in solitary confinement, deprived of sleep and interrogated regularly.
They have been allowed one brief consular visit per month, and no access to lawyers prior to their formal arrest.
Mr Lu would not say where the two men were currently.
Mr Kovrig has been held in an undisclosed location near Beijing while Mr Spavor was held in Liaoning province, where he previously owned a business operating tours to North Korea.

Donald Trump has been sounding supremely confident that US consumers will emerge unscathed from his trade war, but economists fear households are already starting to be hit by earlier rounds of tariffs and will face a mounting burden as hostilities escalate.
While the president has declared there is “no reason” US households will have to pay the tariffs, recent academic studies argue the costs of existing levies have been passed on to households and businesses, and there is no clear evidence that Chinese exporters have cut their prices to compensate.
With the prospect of further escalation in hostilities ahead, Federal Reserve officials including New York Fed president John Williams are now on the lookout for a boost to inflation.
In addition, the potential drain on confidence among businesses, financial markets and consumers from a worsening trade war could damage growth, creating an “unfortunate cocktail” for Fed policymakers, said Torsten Slok at Deutsche Bank.
“The tariffs are a stealth tax on American businesses and consumers,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. If Mr Trump ups the ante further and targets all Chinese imports, “American consumers will be on the front line of the trade war”.
On Friday, the Trump administration said it would raise tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports to 25 per cent.
It then set in motion a plan that could, following a comment period, impose 25 per cent tariffs on a further $300bn of Chinese imports.
If the White House also goes on to impose tariffs on auto imports, the peak boost to core inflation could reach 0.9 of a percentage point, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, alongside a dent in gross domestic product.
Research from Mary Amiti of the New York Fed, Stephen Redding of Princeton University and David Weinstein of Columbia University in March found that the “full incidence” of the tariffs has fallen on domestic consumers so far.
This had imposed a so-called deadweight loss to the US — a drain on the economy beyond the direct cost of the levies — of $1.4bn a month by the end of last year.
Prof Weinstein said in an interview he estimated the administration’s decision to boost tariffs on $200bn of imports from China would increase the deadweight cost to $6.6bn a month, or $628 per household a year.
Adding in the payments of tariffs to the federal government, the total cost of the tariffs would rise from $4.4bn a month at the end of last year to $8.8bn a month once the new tariffs were implemented, he estimated.
The administration has attempted to shield households from the tariffs under past rounds by excluding key categories of consumer goods, but it will not be able to avoid hitting households if Mr Trump targets the rest of China’s exports to the US.
Consumer goods account for only 25 per cent of the items targeted by the increased tariff unveiled on Friday, according to Goldman Sachs, but as much as 60 per cent of the remaining imports from China.
Ken Perkins, president of the Retail Metrics consultancy, estimated that US retailers would push up prices on Chinese consumer products subject to tariffs by between 3 and 8 per cent in response to the latest wave of levies.
While the previous 10 per cent increases “haven’t really had a lot of impact on price”, the rise to 25 per cent was “a different story”, he said.
Executives echoed that sentiment.
Presenting earnings on Tuesday, Jane Hamilton Nielsen, Ralph Lauren’s chief financial officer, said that while the tariffs so far had a “limited impact”, the fashion group was taking steps to “mitigate the long-term impact” of further increases.
Several retailers and manufacturers are trying to become less reliant on production and sourcing from China.
Examples include GoPro, the camera maker, which said this week it would press ahead with a plan to shift production of US-bound goods from China to Guadalajara, Mexico.
US retailer Hudson, which operates 88 stores at locations including airports, hotels and stations, also told analysts this week that the company was examining whether it could diversify its supply chain.
Roger Fordyce, chief executive, said the company was examining costs and that the group planned to adjust retail prices accordingly.
However, Mr Perkins noted that the highly competitive nature of the retail sector would constrain the industry’s ability to pass higher import costs on to shoppers.
Even before the latest wave of tariffs, Americans had been paying more at the checkout on a range of products.
Rising commodity, labour and transport costs have encouraged consumer product manufacturers and retailers to push up prices.
Figures from Nielsen show that prices on a basket of household products, from nappies to bin bags, rose 2.5 per cent in the year to the end of March, more than double the rate of the previous year.
Food and drink prices rose by less, up 2 per cent, picking up from a 1.4 per cent increase the previous year.
Government inflation data covers a far broader range of prices, including healthcare, financial services and accommodation costs.
Overall, inflation numbers remain quiescent, with the core personal consumption expenditure price index rising just 1.6 per cent year on year in March, and the Fed’s bigger concern in recent months has been low price growth.
Mr Williams told Bloomberg on Tuesday that the tariffs that had already been announced could add two-tenths to the inflation rate over the next year, but the effects would get larger if there was a further escalation of tariffs.
This could be a “significant effect”, he added.
Yet some economists argue the bigger worry for the Fed will be the growth implications of a worsening trade conflict, given tariff increases should in principle wash out of inflation numbers once they are put in place.
Deutsche Bank’s Mr Slok said the boost from Republican tax cuts had helped mask the impact of tariffs last year, but this would fade over time.
The key question now was the repercussions from trade tensions for the stock market, corporate confidence and household sentiment, he said.

Cisco Systems said on Wednesday that it had slashed its manufacturing in China in anticipation of higher import tariffs levied in the US, as it laid out a financial forecast that showed it did not expect to be hurt by the deepening trade war.
The maker of networking equipment has been among the US tech companies most in the line of fire, with many different types of data centre equipment included on a list of imports from China that have been subjected to a higher, 25 per cent tariff since the end of last week.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Chuck Robbins, chief executive, said the company had started planning for the higher tariffs last summer, when the White House put a 10 per cent levy on many of its products, with a threat to increase the rate to 25 per cent later.
Cisco had “a reasonably distributed supply chain” with manufacturing facilities in 13 countries, he said, giving it flexibility to move production capacity between plants.
“When you have capabilities in multiple countries, it’s not so hard to do,” he said, meaning that the price increases Cisco had to impose at the end of last week to make up for higher tariffs were “minimal”.
Kelly Kramer, chief financial officer, added on a call with Wall Street analysts that Cisco had “greatly reduced our exposure” to production in China, and company executives said the shift was reflected in its financial forecasts for the current quarter. Cisco said it expected revenue growth of 4.5-6.5 per cent in the three months to the end of July, implying revenues of $13bn-$13.3bn, roughly in line with Wall Street expectations. It also forecast pro forma earnings per share of 80 to 81 cents.
The assurances about Cisco’s greatly reduced trade war exposure came as it reported revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street’s expectations in its latest quarter, sending its shares up by more than 3 per cent in after-market trading on Wednesday.
The performance matched its solid growth in the preceding three months, when the company proved itself more resilient to global economic and political uncertainties than most analysts had expected.
Mr Robbins said Cisco still had relatively little “visibility” into how the state of the world in the months ahead would affect its business, but that it still felt confident in its near-term forecasts.
The latest quarter was underpinned by 9 per cent revenue growth in the Americas, with the Asia-Pacific region falling 4 per cent.
Demand from most of the company’s customer segments remained robust, though orders from telecommunications service providers — typically a more volatile part of the business, given the large size of individual contracts — fell by 13 per cent.
The US networking equipment company turned in revenue growth of 6 per cent to $13bn, slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts.
Pro forma earnings per share, at 78 cents, came in 1 cent above expectations, and were 18 per cent up on the year before.

EU exports to China rose by more than a tenth, dispelling fears of a deceleration prompted by a slowdown in Asia’s largest economy and repercussions of escalating tension between Washington and Beijing over trade.
In the first quarter, the EU exported 11.3 per cent more goods to China compared with the same period a year ago, the fastest increase among the bloc’s major trading partners.
In the three months to March 2018, the rate was 1 per cent, the statistics office said.
By contrast, exports from many Asian countries to China declined in the same period, according to their national statistics.
The EU meanwhile exports mainly consumer goods to China, a sector that has been less affected by US-China trade disputes.
“The Chinese import slowdown is more about supply-chain effects than weak domestic demand,” said Adam Slater, economist at Oxford Economics.
Exports to the US rose at an annual 8.2 per cent, while exports to Turkey underperformed with a double-digit decline, as the economy shrank at an annual rate of 3 per cent at the end of last year.
The eurozone’s trade balance however extended a decline as imports growth outpaced that of exports.
In the 12 months to March, the eurozone trade balance dropped to €190bn, more than 20 per cent below the level in the same period last year.

In 1995, I was invited to join the team responsible for choosing the wine on British Airways. I felt very grown-up.
Other team members were Hugh Johnson, the world’s best-selling wine author, Michael Broadbent, head of Christie’s wine department, and Colin Anderson, another Master of Wine who was once responsible for buying so much wine for Allied Lyons that his nose was insured with Lloyd’s.
We would all trek out to Hatton Cross and taste blind hundreds of wines submitted in the hope of being airborne. Eventually, we came up with a shortlist that gave the BA buying team something to get their teeth into.
Two particularly wine-minded former stewards, Peter Nixson and Andy Sparrow, did all the hard work of organising the tenders, balancing the selection, getting the wines to the right warehouses and monitoring the stock.
This was BA’s golden age. Cabin crews were encouraged to attend special wine courses. Budgets were generous. Wines in first class would typically include a top classed growth claret and a premier cru white burgundy. Concorde, of which we were all so proud, was the jewel in the crown. Our tastings would be punctuated by the noise of Concorde taking off.
We were especially proud of the Concorde Cellar, with its wines （almost） worth the price of the ticket. The beauty was that “only” about 100 cases were needed, instead of the thousands usually required, which curtail the possibilities from regions such as Burgundy that are dominated by small-scale producers. （There is a reason why the bigger merchants of Beaune and co-ops of Chablis feature so heavily on airline wine lists.） Nixson and Sparrow turned up to one prestigious Burgundian property to find a gate that had previously remained firmly closed was opened miraculously quickly when they mentioned the C-word.
But then came September 2001 and the airline industry would never be the same again.
For us, the immediate change was that BA pruned its wine consultant team down to me alone and Sparrow moved to food.
I hope Nixson and I did as good a job at selecting the best wines blind, but it was far less fun, only partly because budgets had started to shrink.
Concorde became a luxury BA struggled to afford and was grounded in 2003.
In 2009, Willie Walsh, then head of BA, abandoned the policy of choosing wines on the basis of what they tasted like, cutting costs by appointing a single exclusive supplier for each of the three classes.
In 2010, I resigned. But I have remained fascinated by airline wine. Some medics advise against consuming anything alcoholic at 33,000ft, but I can spend a good half-hour reading an in-flight wine list on a long-haul flight, and far longer testing its contents.
In this era of budget airlines and fuel surcharges, it’s becoming rarer to have a panel of consultants who choose airline wines on the basis of blind tastings.
But, twice a year, Singapore Airlines convenes wine writers Oz Clarke and Jeannie Cho Lee plus Australian Master of Wine Michael Hill Smith to spend a week choosing from hundreds of possibilities.
A surprising number of airlines, including Cathay Pacific, are supplied by a company based in the Middle East, a region not known for its wine consumption.
MMI is based in Dubai and supplies the Middle Eastern airlines that today have the finest wine selections in the air.
Emirates offers first growth bordeaux in first class, and sometimes second growths in business class.
Etihad and Qatar Airways are not far behind in what they offer the oenophile.
These Middle Eastern airlines may be cushioned by being state-owned, but the national airlines of wine-producing countries such as Australia and New Zealand are also of interest to those who care about what they drink.
That said, their country’s finest wines — though prominently vaunted — never seem to be on the flight I’m travelling on.
Many US airlines are supplied by the Napa Valley-based Intervine and, although Americans like to complain about their domestic carriers, the selection offered on board American Airlines specifically is reported to have improved.
Unfortunately, the wine selections on the two major airlines based in the UK, Virgin and British Airways, belie our nation’s standing as a major global force in wine.
Virgin appeals much more effectively to the cocktail sipper than to the wine drinker, while one close trade observer describes the current state of wine-buying at BA as “rock bottom — there’s only one way for them to go”.
BA’s wine-buying is now in the hands of two young Frenchmen working for the parent company IAG. They seem to have had little experience of wine-buying. The dire state of their budget can be judged from a recent discussion on Flyertalk.com. The Villa Maria Sauvignon Blanc on offer in BA first class was spotted in Morrisons at £5 a bottle, two for £9. （BA says it is no longer on the menu.） In a recent first class tender, submissions that were over €6 a bottle from the cellar door were rejected. （The budget for forward buying of claret used to be €25.）
The glass of champagne that welcomes anyone who has paid thousands for their seat at the front of a plane is seen as the most important wine served on any flight.
Even BA realises this, and has not （yet） pared Laurent-Perrier’s Grand Siècle from first class — although one can only imagine the negotiations that keep it there.
It cunningly also offers a much cheaper champagne and, quite rightly, an English sparkling wine, which presumably helps to reduce costs.
Krug and Dom Pérignon are de rigueur for the Asian airlines, and Emirates offers the super-special, extra-aged Dom Pérignon P2.
If you were really greedy, you might even be able to drink the cost of your ticket.
An expert’s guide to airline wine
Fellow wine writer Charles Metcalfe has been chairing Business Traveller’s business and first class airline wine competition for more than 10 years.
On Monday, he anointed Australian carrier Qantas this year’s overall winner.
Here are some of his observations:
In the air, you don’t want a tough red; it has to be good to drink now.
Airlines have always submitted lots of red bordeaux. The wines have become a bit easier to cope with because recent vintages have given riper, rounder wines.
Red bordeaux and white burgundy still rule the roost to a great extent but airlines are getting a bit more adventurous.
New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir are safe bets because they’re so easy to appreciate.
Producer nations now have more confidence in their own wines, which is great.
It’s fun to have good wines from Italy, Spain or Portugal.
Airlines still haven’t cottoned on that we prefer having something that we might enjoy to a smart name.
We judge blind, so we can’t be impressed by labels.
Squeezed budgets aren’t a problem because we know you can find very good wines at lower prices.
Most airline buyers are still selecting “famous” names, even though these won’t always give the most pleasure.

China’s move to increase tariffs on $60bn in US goods targets a commodity central to the Trump administration’s goal of exporting more energy: liquefied natural gas.
Trade in gas condensed for shipment on ocean vessels has boomed in the past five years, reaching a record 316.5m tonnes in 2018, according to the International Gas Union.
China has become the world’s second-biggest LNG importer as it seeks a cleaner alternative to coal to generate electricity.
Liquefaction plants sponsored by energy majors such as ExxonMobil and independent companies such as Cheniere Energy promise to make the US an important LNG exporter, following its ascent as the premier natural gas supplier after shale drilling transformed its production.
China’s 25 per cent tariff on US gas has jolted that trajectory.
The duty, announced this week in retaliation for added tariffs from the White House, is a rise from an earlier 10 per cent levy that China imposed last September.
It is due to take effect June 1.
The escalation creates tension between the US attempt to apply pressure on China to reform trade practices and its hope of using energy exports to exert influence in international affairs.
Underlining the significance of LNG, President Donald Trump on Tuesday visited the newly constructed Cameron LNG terminal in Louisiana.
“The US has positioned its natural gas resource as hydrocarbon freedom — the administration has taken that stance. But the fight for freedom has gotten a little bit more difficult,” said Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, a consultancy in Washington.
The first exports of US LNG outside of Alaska left Cheniere’s plant at Sabine Pass, Louisiana, in early 2016.
Cheniere has since completed five trains, or liquefaction units, at Sabine and the first train at another terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas.
Another plant opened in Cove Point, Maryland, last year, with Cameron and others set to begin exporting this year.
The higher tariff in China would exacerbate the effects felt since the first one took effect.
From September 2018 to April, the US delivered four cargoes to China, down from 35 cargoes in the same eight-month period of 2017-18, Wood Mackenzie said in a note.
The slowdown came even though China’s imports and US exports each grew about a third, the consultancy noted.
“A 25 per cent tariff is probably going to mean that no US LNG will be going to China,” said Nikos Tsafos, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
He added that the effect on current LNG facilities would be minimal because “the market has already adjusted and the US LNG will be going somewhere else”.
The bigger impact may be on projects for which contracts have not yet been signed.
Companies seeking to finance LNG plants must first obtain long-term commitments from customers.
“In addition to the short-term impact, tariffs also have the ability to make long-term contracts more difficult to negotiate,” said Charlie Riedl, executive director of the Center for LNG, a trade group.
The only Chinese company to have signed a long-term supply agreement with a US LNG project was a division of China National Petroleum Corporation, which last year committed to buy gas from Cheniere through 2043. Underscoring US concerns, a division of CNPC and the Chinese state-owned oil company Cnooc last month took stakes in the proposed Arctic LNG 2 led by Novatek of Russia.
Cheniere’s shares fell 3.3 per cent after China announced the tariff increase on Monday, but bounced with the stock market on Tuesday.
Jack Fusco, chief executive, said on an earnings call last week: “I think the trade tensions and the tariffs are unproductive and create some added costs to our Chinese consumers. But as a company, we’re relatively insulated from the current future tariffs and we don’t expect any material impacts.”
Plants with a total of 34m tonnes per year of capacity were operating in the US as of December, with another 50m tonnes under construction and due for completion in 2019-20, the International Gas Union said.
Almost 20 more have been proposed , “only a few” of which are likely to advance to a final investment decision, construction and operation, the group said.
Shares of Tellurian, a company whose Driftwood LNG terminal in Louisiana awaits a final investment decision, plunged almost 9 per cent on Monday before rebounding 4.4 per cent on Tuesday.
Charif Souki, Tellurian chairman, said: “China imposing tariffs on US LNG is a classic example of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”
Mr Souki, formerly chief executive of Cheniere, said the company was in advanced negotiations with groups including Total of France, Petronet of India and others in the Middle East.
“We welcome other investors yet we are very confident that we will reach FID [final investment decision] within the next few months with or without Chinese participants,” he said.

The Trump administration has launched a dramatic attack on Huawei by requiring US companies to obtain licences to sell critical technology to the Chinese telecoms company.
The White House and Department of Commerce took dual actions on Wednesday that will effectively ban Huawei from selling technology into the American market, and could also prevent it from buying semiconductors from Qualcomm in the US that are crucial for its production.
Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring a “national emergency” in relation to threats against US telecommunications, in a move that authorised the commerce department to “prohibit transactions posing an unacceptable risk” to national security.
In a potentially much more significant development, the commerce department put Huawei on the so-called Entity List — a move that means US companies will now have to apply for a licence to sell technology to the Shenzhen-based telecoms company.
Paul Triolo, an technology policy expert at Eurasia Group, said putting Huawei on the Entity List was a “huge development” that would hurt the Chinese firm but also impact global supply chains involving US companies such as Intel, Microsoft and Oracle.
“The US has basically openly declared it is willing to engage in a full fledged technology war with China,” he said, adding that placing Huawei on the “dreaded Entity List has global ramifications, as Huawei supplies dozens of leading carries around the world”.
Huawei responded to the US measures by saying it was ready to engage with the US government to come up with measures to ensure the security of its products.
“Restricting Huawei from doing business in the US will not make the US more secure or stronger; instead, this will only serve to limit the US to inferior yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the US lagging behind in 5G deployment, and eventually harming the interests of US companies and consumers,” Huawei said. “In addition, unreasonable restrictions will infringe upon Huawei’s rights and raise other serious legal issues.”
Mr Triolo said the US government could give some firms licences to sell to Huawei, but the threat of denial meant “any carrier using [Huawei’s] gear will have to reconsider continuing to rely on the company for existing and next generation 5G networks”.
Qualcomm declined to comment on the listing of Huawei on the Entity List.
Dennis Wilder, a former head of China analysis at the CIA, said the combination of the executive order and listing on the Entity List was part of a “full court press” against Huawei that represented “the beginning of decoupling” from Chinese telecoms.
The executive order to effectively ban Huawei from selling technology into the American market, which had been debated internally since last year, came just days after the US and China failed to reach a deal to end the  escalating trade war .
Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican senator, gave the White House “enormous credit for their efforts to comprehensively tackle the threat that Huawei and other foreign state-directed telecommunications companies”.
Mark Warner, a Democratic Virginia senator, said it was a “needed step” that reflected the fact that Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese equipment provider “represent a threat to the security of US and allied communications networks”.
China hawks in the administration had been pushing Mr Trump to sign the executive order amid rising alarm within national security circles about the vulnerability of Huawei-supplied wireless networks to Chinese spying.
Mr Trump had previously resisted because he did not want to affect trade negotiations.
In February, Mr Trump said he wanted the US to win the 5G ultra-high speed mobile telecommunications race through competition and “not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies”.
That was widely seen as referring to Huawei.
At the same time the US national security establishment has been pushing other countries to bar Huawei from 5G networks.
Australia and Japan have joined the US in barring Huawei from involvement in 5G, and New Zealand’s intelligence services have expressed concern.
But the UK and Germany have  indicated they will allow Huawei to provide equipment for their 5G networks, in decisions that sparked US anger.

Alibaba on Wednesday outlined expectations to increase annual revenues by a third this year, to Rmb500bn （$72.6bn）, as the sprawling Chinese tech company unveiled stronger than expected revenue growth in the last three months of its financial year.
Sales increased 51 per cent year-on-year in the quarter to the end of March, to Rmb93.5bn.
Revenues for the full fiscal year were Rmb376.84bn, up 39 per cent when stripping out the boost from newly acquired businesses, including food delivery group ele.me.
The numbers from Alibaba, which derives 83 per cent of its revenues from domestic ecommerce, suggested China’s shoppers remained in fine fettle at the beginning of the current calendar year.
But the results were in sharp contrast to official statistics for growth in nationwide retail sales for April, also released on Wednesday.
The figures showed growth in retail sales decelerated to just 7.2 per cent in the month, the slowest pace in 16 years.
Alibaba vice-chairman Joe Tsai shrugged off concerns about the impact of the US-China trade dispute, saying the company was on the right side of trends that would result in growing Chinese consumption and desire for imported goods.
“We are not concerned with slowing exports growth . . . because China is shifting from an export economy to a consumption economy,” he said.
Nevertheless, Alibaba continues to pay the price for acquiring market share in areas such as food delivery, as well as commerce in less developed parts of China.
As a result, margin erosion continued to dog the Hangzhou-based group in the fourth quarter.
At the operating level, margins for the quarter fell from 15 per cent to 9 per cent.
Operating income of Rmb8.76bn — below consensus analyst expectations — was down 5 per cent year on year, dented by a $250m payment to settle a class-action lawsuit.
The suit alleged Alibaba concealed regulators’ angst about counterfeit goods on its commerce platform.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the fiscal fourth quarter was Rmb25.83bn, boosted by revaluation gains on investments.
Adjusted net income, which strips out such gains, was up 42 per cent at Rmb20.06bn, ahead of analyst expectations.
Despite the strong numbers, Alibaba chief executive Daniel Zhang said the group would not expand charges to merchants for targeted “recommendation feed” advertising this fiscal year.
He added the group would invest in building up business in less developed parts of China, in a nod to the competition spawned by fast-growing rival Pinduoduo.
Steven Zhu, analyst at Pacific Epoch, said the move was a reversal of the company’s earlier efforts to position its ecommerce platform Taobao more upmarket, and warned that selling lower priced items to people on limited incomes would prove less lucrative.
Alibaba also posted strong growth in its lossmaking cloud business, with revenues up 76 per cent, at Rmb7.7bn.
Its digital entertainment business, however, saw more sluggish growth, with revenues up just 8 per cent, to Rmb5.67bn, in the quarter.

The hardest thing for a hegemonic power is to see its dominance wane.
US president Donald Trump’s angry unilateralism, whether his trade war against China or sanctions against Cuba, is supposed to be proof of power.
Another way of looking at the president’s belligerent tweetstorms is as a cry of pain for a mythologised past.
When Franklin Roosevelt prepared to meet Winston Churchill during the closing stages of the second world war, the US president received some cautionary advice from his secretary of state on handling the British prime minister.
Churchill, Edward Stettinius told Roosevelt, would struggle to accept a new, postwar, international order.
Having been a leader for so long, the Brits were not accustomed to a secondary role.
Stettinius was right. Britain had been bankrupted by the war. America was booming. The peace marked the formal transfer of western leadership to the US. Washington’s ally found the psychological adjustment long and painful. Even after the humiliation of the Suez expedition in 1956, Britain was loath to own up. Surely, its politicians imagined, it still sat alongside the US and the Soviet Union as one of the “Big Three”? Bizarre as it seems, there remains an echo of this howl of anguish in the “global Britain” fantasies of leading Brexiters.
Now it is America’s turn.
The truculence of Mr Trump’s foreign policy is meant to convey that the US can do as it pleases.
Lesser nations may feel the need to submit to a panoply of international rules.
But the US can stand alone, free of the multilateral entanglements and costly alliances it established after the end of the second world war.
Parallels with Britain are necessarily far from exact.
The US remains the pre-eminent global power — economically, technologically and militarily.
The dollar’s place as the world’s reserve currency provides a unique capacity to apply economic coercion.
Russia is a falling power.
China’s plan to dominate Eurasia is a decades-long project.
For all that, America’s unipolar moment has passed as quickly as it appeared at the end of the cold war.
US power has been checked and, in relative terms, is in steady decline.
Not so long ago, the hyperpuissance, as the French called it, imagined a future of effortless ascendancy.
In China, the US now faces a rival with its own sense of manifest destiny.
As America’s position erodes, fewer nations swear unquestioning fealty.
Vladimir Putin’s Russia, though facing absolute decline, is openly defiant.
Washington has yet to made the psychological shift. Mr Trump’s response is not without a crude logic. The postwar decades saw an extraordinary alignment of the American national interest with a rules-based international system. In designing and building the institutions of a liberal global order, the US promoted its own prosperity and security. The adage that what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa was essentially true. When the US underwrote the peace in Europe, East Asia and the Middle East, it did so to its own advantage.
This is the age Mr Trump harks back to.
The clue is the “again” in “Make America Great Again”.
The president is trapped in a world where economic might was indeed measured by auto sales, trade was essentially about tariffs, and the response to a recalcitrant government in Tehran was for the CIA to organise a coup.
The mindset is well described in Anglo Nostalgia, a recently-published book by two European scholars, Edoardo Campanella and Marta Dassù.
Start with an idealised view of the past, stir in the paranoia beloved of populists everywhere and, hey presto, you have the nostalgic nationalism that is Mr Trump’s foreign policy.
Barack Obama’s misfortune was that he grasped fairly early on the significance for US interests of these global power shifts.
Mr Trump’s predecessor drew the right conclusions.
If the US could no longer act unilaterally, its interests were best served by leveraging its alliances.
If global rules needed changing, the US would deploy its convening authority to shape the new order.
For his pains, Mr Obama was lambasted as hesitant and weak.
Mr Trump’s answer is that if the system no longer works for the US then he should break it up.
It all sounds tough, especially alongside the theatrical attempts at dealmaking.
The problem is that it does not work.
The US has been the loser from throwing overboard multilateral trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Mexico has yet to stump up a single dollar to pay for a wall on its border with the US.
North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has secured de facto recognition of his country’s nuclear status.
Iran may be feeling the pain of US sanctions but the odds are the hardliners in Tehran will be the main beneficiaries.
Mr Putin operates with impunity in Syria and, more recently, Venezuela.
Mr Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate change accord has handed the moral high ground to Chinese president Xi Jinping.
The list goes on.
Among allies, whether Japan, the Republic of Korea or European partners in Nato, the US has lost trust.
The common denominator in the policies of all these nations is a hope they can simply “ wait out” Mr Trump’s presidency.
This is probably a mistake.
Mr Trump is not alone among Americans in his disillusionment with the old order.
But the louder the president shouts the less inclined the rest of the world is to listen.

The US has ordered the departure of all non-essential staff from its diplomatic missions in Iraq, while Germany and the Netherlands suspended military training programmes in the country as tensions soar between the US and Iran.
The decisions follow a series of warnings by American officials over the past 10 days about unspecified “escalatory action” by Iran, which have been accompanied by US military deployments to the region.
Both Washington and Tehran have insisted they do not want war, but European diplomats have expressed concerns that the heightened tensions could lead to an “accidental” conflict.
Iraq, which shares a long border with Iran, is home to Iranian-backed Shia militias and serves as a base for an estimated 5,000 US troops, who have been supporting the fight against Isis, the Sunni jihadist group.
Germany suspended its training mission with the US-led coalition fighting Isis this week because of concerns about tensions in the region, the government confirmed.
The Netherlands also halted its military training with Iraqi forces due to an unspecified security threat, a spokesman for the Dutch ministry of defence said.
A US embassy spokesperson said the state department ordered the departure of non-essential staff from its embassy in Baghdad and its consulate in Erbil on Wednesday because of “the increased threat stream we are seeing in Iraq”.
The spokesperson declined to give any details about the threat.
Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has also talked about the threat without providing any specifics.

US President Donald Trump has moved to avoid an immediate collision with the EU and Japan on trade by deferring a decision to impose tariffs on automotive products by up to six months, according to people familiar with the matter.
The delay proposed by the Trump administration is merely a reprieve for officials in Brussels and Tokyo, as well as car industry executives who would be most affected by the action — since the threat of levies from Washington will remain on the table for most of 2019.
Mr Trump and top officials made the decision ahead of a Saturday deadline to take action following a confidential report delivered in February to the White House from the commerce department, which outlined the  national security risk posed by foreign vehicles and automotive components.
Most industry lobbyists were expecting Mr Trump to delay the imposition of auto tariffs, or to announce and then suspend them, in order to avoid blowing up trade relations with the EU and Japan amid an escalation of the US’s trade dispute with China.
“You can’t fight multiple trade battles at the same time. You have to pick who your biggest enemy is,” said one former US trade official who has been following the deliberations on car tariffs.

China sold the most Treasuries in more than two years in March, ratcheting up concerns that the country might weaponise its position as the US government’s largest foreign creditor in the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries.
China sold $20.5bn of US government bonds over the course of the month, according to data released by the US Treasury on Wednesday.
The data covers trading in Treasuries with a maturity of more than one year by foreign official institutions such as central banks as well as private investors.
Other major foreign holders, including Japan and the UK, were also net sellers.
Analysts noted the period covered by the data is before the latest breakdown in trade talks between the US and China and the subsequent increase in tariffs on Chinese imports by the Trump administration.
Except for a small net purchase last month, China has now sold Treasuries every month since September.
A fear in the US is that China could ramp up its sales of Treasuries in an attempt to disrupt the market and put upward pressure on US interest rates, in effect raising borrowing costs for the US government.
“In almost all my client meetings I get a question over whether this tool will be used,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. “The sheer size of [China’s] reserves and that this is even becoming a conversation means the market should take it seriously.”
But several investors and analysts have dismissed the threat that China will resort to such drastic action as to sell down its US Treasury holdings.
China is the largest foreign holder of Treasuries, owning a total of $1.12tn, meaning any increase in yields it could engineer would also mean losses on its own portfolio.
The size of China’s Treasury holdings are testament to the trade imbalance with the US.
One of the reasons China buys Treasuries is because of the dollars it acquires from exports to the US.
Analysts said China typically sells Treasuries when it needs to support its own currency, in effect selling dollars.
“This is going to be a long-term phenomenon where they are going to have to support their currency and ease financial conditions,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities.
The sales in March stood out in part because the currency remained flat versus the dollar through the month.
In addition, the sales had little effect on the direction of US interest rates’ 10-year Treasury yields fell 31 basis points to 2.41 per cent.
“Normally the answer to why this has happened has been very similar — it’s been the exchange rate,” said Mr Slok. “This time the number is more surprising. There are a lot of open questions.”

When I was younger, I chaired a discussion about new opportunities to sell products and services to older consumers.
With the population ageing, the panellists predicted a rise in orders for large-print restaurant menus.
There would be growing demand for cruise ships with easy-to-open door handles.
They were exciting times for those hoping to attract a large, affluent, time-rich group of consumers.
Now that I have reached the age we were talking about, I am not interested in these carefully-directed products.
Companies dedicated to the needs of baby boomers — those born between 1946 and 1964 — hold no particular attraction for me.
It seems I am not alone.
Last week, Saga, the personal finance and travel company for the over-50s, more than halved its dividend and warned of falling profits in the coming year.
Saga said it faced particular problems in its insurance business.
The company had been a forerunner in spotting what an attractive insurance proposition older customers were.
They were more cautious drivers, and had fewer accidents.
Because they spent more time at home, they were less likely to be burgled.
But other insurers now have the same data. And they often offer lower premiums. I have had Saga insurance policies in the past. But price comparison websites this year showed there were cheaper options elsewhere.
Lance Batchelor, Saga’s chief executive, said the answer was to move “the conversation from price to value”. What sort of value? “Get to your UK destination by taxi if your car’s too damaged,” Saga’s website offers. “Receive eligible private medical treatment if you or your spouse/partner is injured.”
I will stick with the lower prices, thanks.
The theory of distinctive marketing to older consumers seemed sound.
The number of people over the age of 60 is expected to double worldwide from 962m in 2017 to 2.1bn by 2050, according to UN figures.
Europe has the most aged population, with 25 per cent of people over 60.
By 2050, about a quarter of the population in all parts of the world, apart from Africa, will be over 60, the UN says.
Rising longevity will inevitably lead to increased need for specialised housing, medical and social care for those reaching the ends of their lives and struggling with physical and mental impairments.
But the decades before then, currently populated by baby boomers, present fewer distinct marketing opportunities.
First, as Saga found, baby boomers can make online product and price comparisons and do not need companies to hold their hands.
They can also research their own holiday destinations and find the best ways to get there.
Second, they are the generation that never planned to get old.
When The Beatles asked “Will you still need me when I’m 64?”, 64 years old seemed an impossibly long time away.
Now it has arrived, no one that age particularly wants to be reminded of it.
This generation doesn’t dress old. It expects to look fashionable. There is no need any longer for bifocal glasses, with their tell-tale dividing line across the lens. There are varifocals instead, which are indistinguishable from any other spectacles, and come in the same designer frames （although downward vision is sometimes difficult and you do need to take care with that bottom step）.
Researchers looking for distinctive ways to sell to baby boomers find it difficult to discern any.
A US study into how companies could “delight” baby boomers and millennials — with delight defined as “having one’s expectations exceeded to a surprising degree” — concluded that “significant differences did not exist between baby boomer and millennial males”.
The study, published in the Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice in 2015, did find some differences in what delighted millennial and boomer women.
Female millennials wanted to be served by friendly, attentive and helpful employees, whereas baby boomer women wanted caring employees with expertise.
Millennials were also more delighted if their goods and services were delivered quickly.
These female differences are clearly not vast.
In the words of the Bob Dylan song of their era, today’s over 60s intend to stay forever young.
Providers need to adjust their marketing.
Today’s oldies want quality, service and competitive prices.
They do not want to be corralled into a specialised market.
Companies that forget that risk having to cut their dividends.

Politics used to be show business for ugly people.
Now perhaps it’s sport for incompetents.
Exhibit one: Donald Trump paid virtually no income tax for much of the 1980s and 1990s, because he ran up more than $1bn in losses, documents leaked this week suggest.
In his defence, the US president argued it was a “sport” for property developers to show losses for tax purposes.
Mr Trump didn’t specify which sport he had in mind.
But I get his drift: making glitzy investments while racking up huge financial losses is something Manchester City football club specialises in.
Which brings us to exhibit two: Theresa May this week compared herself to Jurgen Klopp, the Liverpool FC manager whose team miraculously beat Barcelona in a Champion’s League semi-final on Tuesday.
Liverpool’s win “shows [that] when everyone says it’s all over, that your European opposition have got you beat . . . actually we can still secure success,” said Mrs May, who by virtue of being Britain’s prime minister has people who laugh at her jokes.
I don’t blame Mrs May for seeking the association, even if Stuttgart-born Mr Klopp has said that her key policy — delivering Brexit — “makes no sense at all”.
The Premier League stands tall amid national disarray — the UK version of Russia’s Kirov Ballet or the 1992 Cuban Olympic team.
If political leaders insist on seeing themselves as sporting legends, which ones should they be? Mrs May is no Mr Klopp. Nor is she Mauricio Pochettino, the manager of Tottenham Hotspur, who also came back from three goals behind on aggregate to win their semi-final match this week. No, she is one of those managers who arrive promising to impose their philosophy whatever anyone else thinks and are relieved of their duties a few months later. Frank de Boer, whose time at Crystal Palace was brief, springs to mind. If only Conservative MPs were as ruthless as Premier League chairmen.
The Brexit party leader Nigel Farage would of course be Harry Redknapp — ever quotable and therefore destined to appear on our screens for years to come, but never to take charge at the highest level.
Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn is former Chelsea, Leicester and Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri.
Mr Ranieri has exceeded expectations on only one occasion in a long career in English football.
He inexplicably won the title with Leicester, a mid-table team, in 2016, but was sacked nine months later.
Mr Corbyn exceeded expectations in the 2017 general election and remains in post.
We could go on: former foreign secretary Boris Johnson as the enthusiastic but unstrategic former England manager Kevin Keegan?
Chancellor Philip Hammond as the results-oriented but stolid former Stoke City manager Tony Pulis?
But most Premier League managers are not homegrown.
So perhaps it is foreign leaders who really should be compared to the Premier League.
German chancellor Angela Merkel must be the former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger.
Both achieved plenty, but might have done more had they been willing to put the balance sheet at risk.
Their records might also look better if they’d stepped down a couple of years earlier.
Italian politician Silvio Berlusconi shares his mercurial character with the former England manager Glenn Hoddle, Both men are occasionally still mentioned in connection with big jobs.
Or perhaps Mr Berlusconi would be the one-time Bolton guru Sam Allardyce — a man whose legacy looks best when you compare it with what came after.
French president Emmanuel Macron no doubt sees himself as a Pep Guardiola, the restless cosmopolitan innovator currently at the helm at Manchester City.
Heaven forbid he may turn out to be a false prophet like former Chelsea manager André Villas-Boas, destined to end up on a panel at some technology conference talking about the challenges facing today’s global leaders.
As for Mr Trump, he is of course a latter-day José Mourinho, most recently of Manchester United, who, in his own mind at least, was responsible for all the club’s successes and none of its failures.
So which political leaders resemble Mr Klopp and Mr Pochettino, one of whom is about to achieve Champion’s League glory?
Dream on.
If any even came close, they would not feel the need to make the comparison.

President Donald Trump is poised to issue an executive order as early as Wednesday that would effectively prohibit US companies from using any telecoms equipment manufactured by China’s Huawei.
One person familiar with the situation said Mr Trump planned to issue the order on Wednesday afternoon.
The move comes just days after the US and China failed to reach a deal to end the trade war between the countries.
China hawks in the Trump administration have been pushing the president for months to sign the executive order, as the US security and intelligence establishment sounds louder alarms about the Chinese company. Mr Trump previously resisted signing the order, partly because he did not want to jeopardise a potential trade deal with China.
The person familiar with the order said it would not mention any countries or companies by name.
It would instead create a review process that would allow the US commerce secretary to review any transactions involving companies that are viewed as posing a security threat to the US, which would include Huawei.
In February, Mr Trump suggested that he would not sign the executive order by tweeting that he wanted the US to win the 5G ultra-high speed mobile telecommunications race by competition and “not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies”, in a reference that was widely interpreted as referring to Huawei.
“American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind. There is no reason that we should be lagging behind,” Mr Trump tweeted at the time.

The UK’s National Audit Office is investigating the government’s sanctions against tens of thousands of foreign students it accused of cheating to pass English language tests, even though many of them were fluent English speakers.
Some MPs have claimed the English-testing affair could be even “bigger than Windrush”, a scandal the NAO reported on last year. The affair, named after the Empire Windrush, the ship that brought immigrants from the Caribbean to England in 1948, saw officials detaining or deporting longstanding Caribbean immigrants who had every right to live in the UK.
The government is also discussing raising the fees that EU students pay to attend British universities. While there is an argument that, after Brexit, EU students should not be treated more favourably than those from India, China or anywhere else, this proposal has revived criticism from universities that the government does not understand the value of foreign students to the UK economy or the eagerness of competing countries such as Australia, Canada or the Netherlands to win that business for themselves.
Behind all these controversies lies one name: Theresa May. As the NAO noted in its Windrush report in 2010, the year Mrs May became home secretary, her department instituted a policy known as the “hostile environment”, designed to make life for illegal immigrants so unpleasant that they would hesitate to come to the UK and, if they had already arrived, would decide to go home.
The hostile environment policy turned employers and landlords into immigration officers. Banks were told to verify account holders against immigration databases. Companies and landlords were required to check the immigration status of prospective employees and tenants — with the threat of financial penalties if they employed or housed illegal immigrants and criminal prosecution if they did so knowingly or repeatedly.
All countries have immigration laws and those who arrive and stay in contravention of them should face legal sanction, including, where appropriate, removal.
The trouble with the hostile environment policy, and its allied aim of bringing net annual migration down to 100,000 from its 2018 level of 283,000, is that it appeared to treat every immigrant as an illegal unless they could prove otherwise — and then often rejected their proof even when it was overwhelming.
The English-tests affair is a classic example.
There was cheating in the Test of English for International Communication examinations taken by foreign students, as revealed in a 2014 BBC Panorama programme.
The government instructed Educational Testing Service, the US company that administered the exams, to re-examine nearly 60,000 tests. Using voice recognition software, ETS said it found thousands of cases of students sending in proxies to take the tests. The government revoked the visas of more than 35,000 alleged cheats. Many say they have been wrongly accused and videos show some of them speaking good English.
Mrs May’s approach to foreign students generally resulted in her overruling many in her own cabinet who wanted her to take students out of the net immigration figures.
Universities said their inclusion was resulting in UK consulates refusing visas to legitimate students in an attempt to hit the 100,000 target.
The injustice to wrongly pursued immigrants and students should be the biggest concern as it damages individuals and families.
But there is damage to business too.
As prime minister, Mrs May has proposed limiting immigration to those earning more than £30,000 a year.
This has worried employers in fields from agriculture to healthcare.
Josh Hardie, deputy director-general of the CBI employers’ group, said: “All skill levels matter to the UK economy.”
Mrs May will not be around much longer.
She has told her party that she will not contest the next general election, which is due in 2022, but few expect her to last until then.
Will her immigration legacy outlast her?
It depends on who succeeds her, whether Brexit happens and what form it takes.
The UK’s EU residents, who have been promised that they will have a right to stay after Brexit, cannot take much comfort from what has happened to others.
Institutional behaviour does not shift quickly.
Once officials have been schooled to behave in a certain away, it takes time for them to change, even if the political will for a change exists, which it may not.
The hostile environment policy has left a tawdry legacy and, as the immigration figures show, it did not even achieve its own objectives.

The founder of the Richer Sounds audio equipment chain is handing control of the business to staff in an unusual move that will trigger windfalls for more than 500 employees.
Julian Richer, who opened his first shop in London Bridge in 1978 and remains the retailer’s sole shareholder, announced that 60 per cent of his stake would be transferred into an employee-owned trust.
“Having hit the ripe old age of 60 in March, I felt the time was right,” Mr Richer said.
“Rather than leaving it until I’m not around, to ensure that the transition goes smoothly and I can be part of it.”
The company will pay Mr Richer £9.2m for his shares but he will give £3.5m of that back to 522 staff, who will receive £1,000 for every year they have worked for the retailer.
The company’s nine board members — the newest of which has served for 25 years — will not share in the bonus.
Mr Richer said he planned to stay involved with the business, but would leave the day-to-day running to the management board.
He is one of the UK’s most successful retailers, building his audio chain into a business with 53 stores nationwide.
The last published accounts show Richer Sounds had a turnover excluding VAT of £157.5m in the 12 months to April 2018, 1 per cent up on the previous year, with a gross margin of 25.4 per cent.
A regular on the UK’s rich lists, Mr Richer, who has no children, was 23 when he bought his first Rolls-Royce, adding a private jet not long after.
His business ethics are driven by a strong Christian faith.
Each week, he hosts a Bible study group at his Georgian mansion in the Yorkshire countryside.
The entrepreneur has previously written in his will that he would like the company turned into a John Lewis-style employee-owned trust after he died.
The Richer Sounds Trustee, as the new entity will be known, will have a set of principles that will ensure the business operates in a responsible manner, based on honesty, commitment, trust and respect, the company said.
The company refuses to employ people on zero-hours contracts and donates about 15 per cent of operating profit to charity each year.
Mr Richer has said that motivating staff was a “crucial element” of the retailer’s success along with its “second to none” commitment to customer service.
The move to employee ownership status, which has been in process for the past 18 months, was welcomed by Deb Oxley, chief executive of the Employee Ownership Association.
“We’re delighted to see it secure its future independence with a focus on its people and an eye on the future world, a world with a more inclusive economy where more businesses are doing well while doing good,” she said.

There’s a memorable scene in the 1980 comedy Airplane! in which the white air hostess can’t understand a black passenger’s slang. “Excuse me,” says a little old white lady, standing up from her seat to help. “I speak jive.” She proceeds to “translate”, with a comic disjunction between her WASP-y appearance and her fluent command of Ebonics.
When the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez addressed Al Sharpton’s National Action Network recently, her Republican critics seemed to detect her speaking “urban”. Ryan Saavedra wrote that “Ocasio-Cortez speaks in an accent that she never uses while telling a room of predominately black people that there is nothing wrong with them folding clothes, cooking, and driving other people around on a bus for a living”. People remarked on her “drawl”; she was even accused — third-rail! — of “blackface”.
I had in mind to write about her use of language in terms of “code-switching” — the sociolinguistic term for the way a speaker adapts his or her language to their audience — and was anticipated by AOC herself. In response to the criticism, she tweeted that: “Folks talking about my voice can step right off. Women’s March & Kavanaugh speech, same. Any kid who grew up in a distinct linguistic culture & had to learn to navigate class enviros at school/work knows what’s up. My Spanish is the same way.”
She even used the term “code-switching” in a later tweet.
It’s a peculiarity of our times that what have hitherto been academic terms of art — “ intersectionality” is another one — have entered mainstream political discourse.
So much the better for the spread of knowledge when they are used correctly.
Linguistically, code-switching is simply a feature of all human language.
None of us speaks a single language: we command multiple registers, syntaxes, accents and vocabularies and we change them according to the company we’re in.
Rhetorically, this is a feature rather than a bug: ethos asks us to forge a connection with an audience, and as the late theorist Kenneth Burke wrote, speaking your audience’s language is the sine qua non of this.
Politically, the effect can go either way.
Being caught code-switching can be held up as a sign of cynicism and inauthenticity.
Public schoolboy politicians such as Tony Blair and David Cameron were much mocked for their estuarine glottal stops.
George W Bush’s down-home Texan drawl was sometimes seen as the affectation of a Connecticut-born Yalie.
At other times — President Donald Trump’s “locker room talk” springs to mind — one code is seized on as a “tell”: a slip that gives us a window into the politician’s unguarded and authentic self.
Both positions, really, are rhetorical strategies: it suits us to pretend that language can affirm or betray some ineffable authenticity, and we will decide which one in each case according to our political preference.
Is British politician Jacob Rees-Mogg’s general refusal to code-switch （he talks like a 19th-century grandee wherever he is） a sign of deep integrity, or a conscious affectation?
You pays your money and you takes your choice.
But in any society in which one dialect is associated with power — ie any society — code-switching is not just a linguistic quirk: language controls access to power.
If your default dialect is the high-status Standard, like JRM, code-switching isn’t the necessity it is if your default dialect is lower-status.
So it shouldn’t be a surprise that women of colour will be more adept at code-switching, and less self-conscious about it or prone to affront when they witness it.

Hear the words “African migrant” and many Europeans conjure up the image of a boat-full of desperate young men fleeing violence and unspeakable poverty in some benighted part of the continent. Like many stereotypes, that image contains a smidgen of truth. Like many, it is also largely wrong.
According to research on African migration by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, which advocates better government on the continent, the picture is more complex.
For a start, only 20 per cent of migrants are fleeing insecurity.
The remaining 80 per cent are seeking better jobs and prospects.
A large proportion are young, well-educated and female.
If they were white, they would be called expatriates.
In fact, not that many African migrants come to Europe at all.
Only 14 per cent of global migrants are African （24 per cent are European） and 70 per cent of those stay within Africa.
In 2017, the top 10 migration flows from Africa added up to less than those migrating from Mexico to the US.
When it comes to African refugees fleeing violence or persecution, some 90 per cent move within the continent.
Countries such as Uganda and Ethiopia are among the most generous hosts of displaced populations, taking in people fleeing conflict in South Sudan, Somalia and elsewhere.
It helps to go back to basics.
Migration is as old as humanity.
If it wasn’t we would all be huddled together in the Rift Valley.
Many civilisations, including the Tang dynasty （AD619-907） and the US for much of the 19th century, were at their most inventive and optimistic when most open to migration.
Mo Ibrahim, the Sudanese businessman behind the foundation, says that migration is “healthy” and “not a disease”.
There are many reasons beyond the narrowly economic to support the free flow of people. One is to see it as an inherent human right. Another is to acknowledge the hypocrisy of previous generations of migrants bolting the door on those yet to arrive. When it comes to Europe’s colonisation of Africa, there is a historic debt. You broke it, you own it.
A recent Pew Research Center survey of public opinion suggests views on immigration are less negative than the headlines.
It found the majority of people in top destination countries supported the contention that migration “makes our country stronger” rather than seeing it as a burden.
Perhaps surprisingly, US attitudes towards migration became more positive than in the 1990s, while growing majorities in the UK, France and Spain also saw the positive side.
Alexander Soros, deputy chair of the Open Society Foundations, goes so far as to say that there is “no migration crisis” outside the manufactured narratives of nationalists.
Yet, whatever research shows, the backlash is palpable from Brexit Britain to Jair Bolsonaro’s Brazil.
Nationalist views cannot simply be blamed on bad faith politicians, many of whom tapped into sentiment that was already there.
Closer examination of the Pew survey shows a social divide in attitudes.
Younger people and those with higher levels of education and income are more likely to see immigration as positive.
Nor is anti-immigrant sentiment exclusively western.
In South Africa, immigrants from Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi have suffered discrimination, violence and even death.
Though most contribute diligently to society, they are commonly made scapegoats.
Even the African National Congress — the original rainbow party — is vowing to cut illegal migration flows.
When it comes to African migration to Europe, more can be done to accentuate the positive and ameliorate the negative.
The EU should encourage legal flows from Africa, perhaps through a US-style “green card” lottery.
To the extent that it tries to discourage illegal flows, it should act in accordance with its purported values.
Outsourcing border control to the Libyan coast guard and to Libyan camps, where migrants are raped, beaten and extorted, categorically does not qualify.
African governments too must play their part.
Why do so many African doctors, academics and scientists come to Europe to find work?
Because too many African states scandalously neglect public health and education, while their elites pay privately abroad.
Domestic opportunities for all would allow talented and ambitious young Africans to pursue their careers at home.
Whatever the politics, the futures of Africa and Europe are intimately bound up.
Proximity is part of the reason.
Demographics is just as important.
Africa’s population will double in a generation to 2bn.
The median age in Africa is 19; in Europe it is 38.
As Europe’s population ages and dwindles, Africa will play an important role in filling the gap.
The sooner European governments see that as a potential positive to be managed, not a negative to fear, the better.

Donald Trump called on the Federal Reserve to help win the trade war with China, saying victory would be inevitable if the US central bank matched stimulus moves in Beijing.
“China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates, as always, in order to make up for the business they are, and will be, losing,” the US president said in a tweet on Tuesday.
“If the Federal Reserve ever did a ‘match’, it would be game over, we win! In any event, China wants a deal!”
Speaking to reporters later on Tuesday, Mr Trump said the US economy was doing well “by every measure” and described the tussle with China over trade as “a little squabble”.
Tensions with Beijing stemmed from its unfair treatment of the US, he argued, predicting the situation would turn out extremely well.
“We’re in a very strong position,” said the president.
Mr Trump’s renewed pressure on Fed chair Jay Powell to lower short-term interest rates came amid a period of volatility on world stock markets as hostilities over trade escalate between the US and China.
On Monday Beijing announced it would raise tariffs on $60bn of US goods, saying it was responding to the Trump administration’s move on Friday to boost tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports to 25 per cent.
The US has set in motion a further plan to impose levies of 25 per cent on a further $300bn of Chinese imports, though no final decision has been made on these and they would only bite after a comment period running into late June.
Shares in the US and Europe bounced on Tuesday following earlier losses.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 index was up 1.3 per cent in midday trading after a 2.4 per cent loss on Monday — its worst since January.
Mr Trump has regularly demanded the Fed slash interest rates to counter risks to growth, but for the time being, the US central bank is signalling rates will be kept on hold.
Some investors are betting that situation will change later this year as trade risks dampen the growth outlook, however, foreseeing a significant chance of a reduction in the second half of the year.
The Fed has sent mixed signals over its next rates move, and added presidential pressure will probably make deliberations more fraught.
Its most recent forecasts in March suggested interest rates will be kept on hold for at least the remainder of the year, but some policymakers have hinted at the idea of an insurance rate cut given low inflation.
This month Mr Powell played down weak inflation, suggesting it is “transitory” and stressing there was no immediate need to move rates higher or lower.
The escalation of trade hostilities could revive one of the so-called downside risks that Fed policymakers have been watching for more than a year, adding to arguments from doves that a rate reduction is in order.
But higher tariffs should temporarily push up inflation, which could alleviate some of the central bank’s worries that price growth is too low.
“Like the market, the Fed doesn’t see the US economy as being particularly at risk because of trade tensions, so one important catalyst for a rate cut is just not there,” said Roberto Perli, an economist at Cornerstone Macro, in a note on Tuesday.
“For now, the best bet remains that the Fed will stay on hold until either the US economy deteriorates significantly or until an agreement is reached that inflation is too low. Neither of those conditions seem very close in time.”

North Korea has rebuked the US over its seizure of a ship allegedly used to evade international sanctions, as tensions simmer over Pyongyang’s missile testing earlier this month.
North Korea’s foreign ministry on Tuesday demanded the US return the Wise Honest, a 17,000-tonne cargo ship, which is  being held on suspicion it was used to illicitly export coal and import heavy machinery.
The statement, issued via North Korean state media, appeared to be the first time Pyongyang had spoken publicly about the vessel, which was intercepted and detained by Indonesian authorities in April 2018 and later seized by the US.
Washington was trying to hold Pyongyang “in submission with its maximum pressure” and had broken the “fundamental spirit” of the joint statement signed between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US president Donald Trump at their summit in Singapore last June, the foreign ministry said.
The US Department of Justice last week detailed the seizure as it asked a federal judge to allow the US to take ownership of the vessel.
That announcement came hours after North Korea on Thursday fired two ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan.
Five days earlier, it had conducted a series of weapons tests thought to include its first missile launch since late 2017.
North Korea’s latest rhetorical outburst highlights the tension between the two sides after diplomatic efforts stalled when Mr Trump and Mr Kim failed to strike a deal over denuclearisation at their Hanoi summit in February.
Patricia Kim, an analyst at the United States Institute of Peace, said the North Korean leader was under pressure domestically after failing to win key concessions from Mr Trump.
“Pyongyang’s recent escalatory actions and sharp rhetoric is aimed not only at the world, but also at its domestic audience. At some point, when Kim feels he’s sufficiently flexed his muscles and demonstrated his resolve, he’ll come back to the negotiating table,” Ms Kim said.
The US and the South Korean governments have sought to downplay Pyongyang’s aggressive actions, helping to allay the rise in tensions.
“But there’s a chance that Kim will miscalculate and push the envelope too far, closing the door on negotiations in the near future,” Ms Kim added.

When I started a new job as the director of a non-profit programme, one of the first orders of business was to read over a memo I’d been handed describing my new duties and responsibilities: it ran to three pages. Single-spaced.
In addition to my work as a journalist and author, I now had a host of other tasks to juggle — managing budgets, supervising staff, fundraising, developing and executing research projects, outreach and more.
On most days, no matter how productive I had been, it felt like something always fell through the cracks.
I didn’t sleep much.
It turns out that what I was experiencing is a phenomenon that researchers are only beginning to study: work-work conflict.
Most people are familiar with the concept of work-life conflict, and how the competing demands of work and home responsibilities can lead to burnout, increased stress, health problems and low satisfaction.
Researchers who study these tensions call both work and home “greedy institutions” because each could consume all your time, energy and attention, making “balance” or “fit” between the two an enormous challenge.
But a group of researchers at Stanford University’s Clayman Institute for Gender Research, who were studying work-life conflict in academic medicine, found that, in addition to being pulled between work and home, the physicians they studied felt torn between all the different kinds of tasks they were expected to do on the job — research, tend to patients, teach, serve on committees and mentor others, not to mention spend hours on paperwork recording it all.
“This combination of different work roles is what drove a lot of tension. For some people, it was even more stressful than work-life conflict,” says Alison Wynn, study author and postdoctoral fellow.
“In order to be a really good physician, that takes all of you. To be a really good researcher, or to be a really good teacher and mentor, that takes all of you. And it’s really difficult to divide yourself between all those different roles.”
The cost of work-work conflict is high, with similar increases in burnout, stress, health problems and low satisfaction, she says. A recent report called physician burnout a public health crisis, revealed nearly half of doctors it surveyed in the US showing at least one burnout symptom such as emotional exhaustion, cynicism, or feeling ineffective.
A majority of the physicians Ms Wynn and her colleagues studied said that what they spent the most time on at work were not the things that mattered most to their career goals or that they were uniquely qualified to do.
Women were less likely than men to have control over their time, or have the resources needed to meet the demands of their various tasks.
One doctor confessed being spread so thin, “I feel like I’m always disappointing someone.”
Researchers identified four key drivers of work-work conflict that managers in any organisation should be paying attention to: competing institutional priorities; ambiguity and the lack of transparency around work expectations; a lack of recognition for certain work activities; and compensation structures that do not align with job responsibilities.
Doctors’ work lives provide a good insight into the challenges.
They are paid by the clinical loads they take on at the hospital, but they’re promoted on the basis of the research they do at the medical school.
Equally, those working in academic medicine are often paid far less than doctors in private practice, yet they’re expected to do more.
In other organisations, how to get ahead is hard to establish if you don’t have ties to those in power or are not in the “old boys” network.
This is compounded by the tendency for organisations to expect women, often women of colour, to plan activities and do the “office housework” that builds team cohesiveness but isn’t recognised or rewarded.
To tackle work-work conflict, a good place for managers to start, Wynn says, is to decide which activities are essential to the organisation, reward those activities, and clarify expectations around what good work means and how people get paid and promoted.
“We really need to think more creatively about how we can get better products and better services by treating people better,” she says.
I still experience work-work conflict, but it’s better.
I sleep more now that I have a clear mission and a great team with defined roles and responsibilities and transparent expectations.
Flexible work or paid leave, which we offered, eases work-life conflict but doesn’t improve work-work conflict.
To do that we needed to restructure the way we worked.
It’s time for other managers, leaders and organisations to begin to do the same.

Intel has revealed a vulnerability in its chips that could lead them to leak data to attackers, underlining the risks from a new flaw in modern chip designs that first surfaced last year.
Security researchers warned that the flaw could pose a particular risk to information being processed in cloud data centres, which many large businesses and governments rely on to handle part of their computing needs.
Known as ZombieLoad, the problem exists in all Intel chips made since 2011, though the chipmaker said its latest microprocessors had been fixed at the hardware level to prevent the problem.
Older chips will need an update to their microcode, along with updates to the operating systems running on them.
Intel said on Tuesday that exploiting the flaw would be “extremely complex relative to other methods that attackers have at their disposal,” and that there have been no reports of attackers using the vulnerability to steal data.
The flaw is “hard to exploit — but it’s also hard to fix,” said Ben Johnson, chief technology officer at Obsidian Security. “It’s the underpinnings of our hardware — which is the underpinnings of our clouds, our desktop computers.”
News of the ZombieLoad problem follows the disclosure early last year of two pervasive chip vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown, which were the first known examples of a new type of design flaw in chips that could open them to attack.
The problem stems from a process known as speculative execution, whereby chips carry out actions on data before being called on by the application in the hopes of anticipating the instructions they will receive next.
The technique plays a central role in speeding up all modern computer chips. But it also potentially opens them up to attack if the data is pushed into a different part of the hardware system where it could be accessed by attackers.
Fixing the ZombieLoad problem could slow down some computer systems considerably if it limits how many different “threads” they can process at the same time.
Apple, one of several companies to put out a software update on Tuesday, said the fix “may reduce performance by up to 40 per cent”. However, warnings that computer performance would suffer because of the fixes to Spectre and Meltdown last year were not followed by widespread reports of problems.
The ZombieLoad flaw is most likely to be exploited in situations where computers run multiple tasks at the same time, because data leaked from one application could be picked up by another, researchers said. That is particularly true in cloud data centres, where applications for different customers run on the same computer, taking advantage of a technique called virtualisation.
The data leaked by speculative execution flaws is unlikely to be of use except to the most determined attackers, said Mr Johnson.
An attacker would have to penetrate the hardware and then sift large amounts of random information in search of anything useful.
He added, though, that stray pieces of valuable data, like computer encryption keys, could be picked up this way.

In late February, with American and Chinese diplomats enmeshed in trade talks a week before a since-extended deadline, a top US agriculture official explained what he hoped would result from a deal.
“I think we’ll see free, fair and reciprocal trade,” Ted McKinney, undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, told reporters.
If free trade is the goal, the White House is taking a roundabout route.
As Donald Trump raised tariffs to 25 per cent on $200bn worth of  Chinese imports last week, the US president declared he would use the proceeds to buy up surplus agricultural products and ship them to “starving countries” as humanitarian aid.
The US agriculture department soon announced it was readying a plan.
The proposed state crop purchases pushed agricultural markets further into uncharted waters a year after the dispute flared between the world’s two largest economies.
Soyabean futures marked a new more-than-10-year low in Chicago on Monday, tumbling 2.1 per cent to $7.805 a bushel.
US soyabean shipments to China effectively dried up last autumn after Beijing hit them with a 25 per cent tariff.
Since December, when trade talks restarted, China committed to buy 20m tonnes in a sign of goodwill.
About 5.6m tonnes have since left US ports.
Another 7.4m tonnes have been sold but not yet shipped.
Farmers now fret that China will cancel the sales.
The new US tariffs are “going to extend this trade war,” said Bill Gordon, who farms corn and soyabeans on 2,000 acres in southern Minnesota. “We’re already bleeding. It’s going to prolong that haemorrhage and not a lot of us are going to be able to make it.”
Recognising the farmers’ plight, the US government last year authorised a $12bn bailout programme that included up to $7.2bn in payments for soyabean growers.
The US also approved the purchase of $1.2bn of foods for donation to  domestic charities.
US soyabean stocks left over before harvest will more than double year-on-year to 27.1m tonnes before the next harvest, the USDA said in monthly supply and demand estimates last week.
A year later, in August 2020, stocks are likely to remain a stubbornly high 26.4m tonnes – four times the average over the past five years.
As a practical matter, cutting down this multimillion tonne soyabean surplus by donating it to foreign countries would be a monumental task.
In fiscal 2017 the government gave a total of 1.8m tonnes of food commodities to recipients in 63 countries including Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen, according to a report to Congress last month.
Almost half the shipments were wheat.
Most of the yellow soyabeans grown by US farmers are not ingested by people. Instead they are crushed at industrial processing plants into animal feed and vegetable oil.
“I don’t think that any food aid recipient in the past needed, or in any way was in the market, for soyabeans,” said Abdolreza Abbassian, grain analyst at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome.
Paul Dorosh of the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute （IFPRI）, said that some soyabeans are processed into a food product for malnourished babies and young children, but the volume of this so-called corn-soyabean blend was “tiny.”
The US had already committed $3.5bn to food aid this year under the Food Assistance Convention, an international agreement.
Among the convention’s principles are one advising members to “purchase food and other components of food assistance locally or regionally, whenever possible and appropriate,” as opposed to importing food from overseas.
US federal law also requires an analysis of whether the receiving country would be able to store the inbound foodstuffs, to prevent them from rotting, and for the US to assess whether the aid would undermine local farmers, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.
Rival agricultural exporters could raise objections to any programme as export subsidies, which are banned under World Trade Organization rules, experts said.
“Finding an appropriate outlet in terms of food aid that wouldn’t depress local markets of recipient countries and could be well used — that would be very difficult,” said Mr Dorosh, director of IFPRI’s development strategy and governance division.
China has more leeway to abandon the US soyabean market at this time of the year because big crops are being gathered in Argentina and Brazil, the two leading South American producers.
Meanwhile, the spread of  African swine fever is decimating China’s pig herds, wiping out 42m tonnes of soyabean import demand over the three years to 2020, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service said in a note.
“African swine fever in China will be a game changer for the global oilseed complex, and soyabeans in particular,” it said.
The toll of the outbreak has lifted prospects for meat producers hoping to supply China.
The National Pork Producers Council, a US pig farming group, embraced Mr Trump’s envisaged food aid package, arguing that pork “should help people in need who otherwise would not have access to this high-quality US protein”.
Other farmers are less effusive.
“‘Farmers do not want a handout from the government,” said Mr Gordon, who is also vice-president at the American Soybean Association, a trade group. “We raise a product and want a fair price for it. Let us compete.”

Both China and America are dissatisfied with the current world order.
The nature of their unhappiness is very different.
But the two countries’ rival ambitions have produced a trade war that now threatens globalisation.
The problem as conceived by Donald Trump is that the world economic system is operating hugely to America’s disadvantage.
The US president complains that “globalism” has helped China to rise at America’s expense — undermining US prosperity and global pre-eminence.
It is that view that underpins Mr Trump’s dramatic decision last week to raise tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese exports to America, from 10 per cent to 25 per cent.
For Xi Jinping, the problem with the current world order is America’s political and strategic dominance.
The Chinese president has made it clear that he wants his country to displace the US as the dominant power in the Asia-Pacific region.
Many Xi-supporting nationalists go further, speaking openly of their hope that China will become the dominant global power.
Mr Xi is well aware that globalisation has been critical to China’s rise over the past 40 years.
So he is determined to preserve the current trade model.
The two presidents’ complaints about the world system are thus mirror images of each other.
Mr Xi wants to change the world’s strategic order, and to do that he needs to maintain its economic order.
Mr Trump wants to preserve the strategic order, and to do that he needs to change the economic order.
America and China are therefore both revisionist powers.
And they are also both status quo powers.
America is the status quo power on geopolitics, so it has become the revisionist power on economics.
China is the revisionist power on geopolitics, so it has become the status quo power on trade.
But the mirror-image positions of Beijing and Washington also imply a convergence of view on globalisation.
The actions of both countries suggest that they basically agree that the current system works better for China than for the US.
While many economists would dissent from that view, it now seems to be the consensus political position in America.
Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democrats in the US Senate, has tweeted his support for the Trump administration’s confrontational policies on trade with China.
In both Washington and Beijing, however, there are divisions between moderates who want the current trade row to end with a deal and radicals who would welcome a lasting breakdown in trading relations.
Protectionist radicals in the Trump administration believe that the Chinese political and economic model is fundamentally hostile to the interests of the US.
And they want to “rebuild” the American economy behind high-tariff walls.
For those who hold this view, a compromise deal that preserves the essence of the current globalised world trading system would be a defeat.
On the Chinese side, the hawks see the trade dispute as a chance to make China less dependent on foreign technology.
Ardent nationalists also interpret the Trump administration’s position on trade as evidence of American weakness.
The correct response, they believe, would be for Beijing to forge ahead with efforts to create a China-centred world order.
The increasingly bellicose attitudes of nationalists in both the US and China look like an illustration of the “ Thucydides’s trap” made famous by Graham Allison, a Harvard professor. Prof Allison has pointed out that, throughout history, rising powers such as China have often gone to war with established powers such as the US.
But the current US-China conflict is a trade war, not a shooting war.
And when it comes to trade, it is the US that is seeking to overturn the current system.
That presents Mr Xi with a difficult tactical choice.
Should China make concessions that are painful, and even humbling, in the interests of preserving the essence of the economic system that has facilitated its rise?
The Chinese are very mindful of the precedent of the Plaza Accord of 1985, in which, under intense US pressure, Japan agreed to revalue its currency.
Many in China believe that, in retrospect, the Plaza Accord represented a successful American attempt to thwart the rise of Japan.
The Trump administration faces a variant of the same dilemma.
Should America aim to exert maximum pressure, with the aim of eventually reaching a “great deal” that fixes flaws in the current system?
Or would a partial victory in the trade war actually amount to a defeat if it failed to halt the rise of China?
By temperament and political interest, Mr Trump is probably still on the side of the dealmakers.
He also continues to set great store by his friendship with Mr Xi, recently praising a “beautiful letter” he had received from the Chinese president.
Yet a close relationship between leaders is no guarantee that conflict can be avoided.
In the July crisis that preceded the outbreak of the first world war in 1914, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany and Tsar Nicholas of Russia exchanged numerous friendly notes and telegrams.
But it did not prevent their two countries sliding into conflict.
In a similar way, the US-China trade war now risks escalating to a point where it escapes the control of the two countries’ leaders.

Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice.
” These brilliant lines by the poet Robert Frost capture the world’s possible economic prospects.
Some warn that the world of high debt and low interest rates will end in the fire of inflation.
Others prophesy that it will end in the ice of deflation.
Others, such as Ray Dalio of Bridgewater, are more optimistic: the economy will be neither burnt nor frozen.
Instead, it will be neither too hot nor too cold, like the baby bear’s porridge, at least in countries that have had the fortune and wit to borrow in currencies they create freely.
William White, former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, presciently warned of financial risks before the 2007-09 financial crisis.
Last year, he warned of another crisis, pointing to the continuing rise in non-financial sector debt, especially of governments in high-income countries and corporations in high-income and emerging economies.
Those in emerging countries are particularly vulnerable, because much of their borrowing is in foreign currencies.
This causes currency mismatches in their balance sheets.
Meanwhile, monetary policy fosters risk-taking, while regulation discourages it — a recipe for instability.
Start then with inflationary fire. Much of what is going on right now recalls the early 1970s: an amoral US president （then Richard Nixon） determined to achieve re-election, pressured the Federal Reserve chairman （then Arthur Burns） to deliver an economic boom. He also launched a trade war, via devaluation and protection. A decade of global disorder ensued. This sounds rather familiar, does it not?
In the late 1960s, few expected the inflation of the 1970s. Similarly, a long period of stable and low inflation has calmed fears of an upsurge, even though unemployment has fallen to low levels. （In the US, it is at its lowest level since 1969.） Some suggest that the Phillips curve — the short-term relationship between unemployment and inflation — is dead, because low unemployment has not raised inflation. More likely, it is sleeping. Inflation expectations may now be anchored. But a strong surge of demand might still sweep them away.
In some ways, a rise in inflation would be helpful.
A sudden jump in inflation would reduce debt overhangs, notably of public debt, just as the inflation of the 1970s did.
Moreover, central banks know what to do in response to a surge in inflation.
Yet higher inflation would also lead to a rise in long-term nominal interest rates, which tend to front-load the real burden of debt service.
Short-term rates would also jump as they did in the early 1980s.
Risk premia would rise.
High-flying stock markets might collapse.
Labour relations would become more strife-prone, as would politics.
This disarray would hit unevenly, causing currency disorder.
The loss of confidence in public institutions, notably central banks, would be severe.
In the end, the likely stagflation would end in severe recession, as in the 1980s.
Now turn to deflationary ice.
This might begin with a sharp negative economic shock: a worsening trade war, a war in the Middle East or a crisis in private or public finance, possibly in the eurozone, where the central bank is relatively constrained.
The result could be a deep recession, even a lurch into deflation, so worsening the debt overhang.
The big difficulty would be knowing how to respond given that interest rates are already so low.
Conventional policy （lower short-term rates） and conventional unconventional policy （asset purchases） might be insufficient.
A range of other possibilities exist: negative rates from the central bank; lending to banks at lower rates than the central bank pays on their deposits; purchase of a much wider range of assets, including foreign currencies; monetisation of fiscal deficits; and “helicopter drops” of money.
Much of this would be technically or politically problematic, and would require close co-operation with the government.
Meanwhile, if governments acted too slowly （or not at all） a depression might ensue, as in the 1930s, via mass bankruptcy and debt deflation.
Many fools recommended that in 2008.
Yet none of these disasters is at all inevitable.
They would be chosen catastrophes.
As Mr Dalio argues, a golden mean is possible.
Fiscal and monetary policy would then co-operate to generate non-inflationary growth.
Changes in fiscal incentives would discourage debt and encourage equity.
Government policy would shift income towards spenders, reducing our current reliance on debt-fuelled asset bubbles for sustaining demand.
Still more debt would be moved out of the balance sheets of financial intermediaries directly on to the balance sheets of households.
Even if real interest rates rose, perhaps because productivity growth strengthened durably, the impact of robust non-inflationary growth on the debt burden would almost certainly outweigh a move to somewhat higher interest rates.
We would, above all, be moving out of “secular stagnation” into something less bad.
That shift might be tricky.
But it would be to a better world.
It is not necessary to repeat the mistakes of either the 1930s or the 1970s.
But we have made enough mistakes already and are, collectively, making enough more right now to risk either outcome, possibly both.
A breakdown of the global economic and political order seems conceivable.
The impact on our debt-encumbered world economy and increasingly fraught global politics is impossible to calculate.
But it could be horrendous.
Above all, nationalistic strongmen would be unable to co-operate if things went seriously wrong, as they might, perhaps even soon.
That is the most worrying feature of our world.

The US has warned that greater military co-operation between EU countries would be a “dramatic reversal” of three decades of transatlantic defence integration, in the latest sign of the fraying relationship between Washington and Brussels.
In a letter seen by the Financial Times, Washington threatened retaliation if the Europeans pressed ahead with rules that it said would restrict the involvement of US companies in pan-European military projects.
The correspondence was sent this month to Federica Mogherini, the EU’s top diplomat, by Ellen Lord, US under secretary of defence, and Andrea Thompson, under secretary of state.
It said that Washington was “deeply concerned” that approval of the rules for the European Defence Fund and the Permanent Structured Cooperation, or Pesco, launched in 2017 to plug gaps in Europe’s military power, would “produce duplication, non-interoperable military systems, diversion of scarce defence resources and unnecessary competition between Nato and the EU”.
“It is vital . . . that independent EU initiatives like EDF and Pesco do not detract from Nato activities and Nato-EU co-operation,” the letter said.
Washington said the rules for the EDF contained “poison pills” that would prevent companies based outside the EU, including the US, from participating in military projects.
The letter also warned that the US could respond with its own restrictions on EU groups.
“It is clear that similar reciprocally imposed US restrictions would not be welcomed by our European partners and allies, and we would not relish having to consider them in the future,” the letter said.
Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU, said in March that if the bloc persisted with its “stubbornness or protectionism” on its multibillion-euro joint military projects, the US would consider various responses unlikely to “be positive for either side”.
The broadside will stoke anxiety among EU diplomats, who think the US has misinterpreted what European military upgrades are intended to achieve.
“There is a lot of misunderstanding of how the European Union works,” said one EU member state official. “They are reading language in it that is fencing the European continent off from American co-operation possibilities — and that’s not true.”
Ursula von der Leyen, Germany’s defence minister, said Europeans “are doing what our American friends have been demanding we do for years. Our task now is to convince our allies that Nato will only profit from the efforts to create a European Defence Union,” she said.
Twenty-five of the bloc’s 28 member states have signed up to Pesco, which involves projects ranging from a spy school to a new generation of battlefield missiles. The EDF is set to receive €13bn in the EU’s next seven-year budget.
EU officials said Pesco was a response to longstanding demands from Washington for Europe to contribute more to Nato, which have grown louder since Donald Trump became president. The EU said it wanted to improve its military capabilities without undermining Nato’s responsibility for Europe’s collective defence.
But US officials argue that the EU’s military plans could weaken Nato rather than enhance it.
Some Nato officials also worry that initiatives such as Pesco could duplicate the alliance’s work and discriminate against non-EU members.
The letter to Ms Mogherini also attacked rules that require ownership of intellectual property arising from an EU project to remain with the recipient in Europe, even after the work is complete.
Washington argued this would discourage non-EU companies from bidding.

A minute or two of newly shot mobile phone video captures an elderly man repeatedly and, it seems, deliberately, preventing the door of a packed Nagoya commuter train from closing.
It has, of course, gone viral.
The footage, co-starring flustered station staff and passengers at the end of their tethers, is exquisite theatre. Nine times, the train’s steel doors bid for closure. Nine times they are thwarted by aged flesh and mischief. The seconds tick by; the natural order of things is challenged; Japan’s famed punctuality is punctured.
The incident and its background are unimportant.
But what stands out is the belligerent conclusion the video’s online audience quickly reached.
This was, the masses decided, yet another case of rougai — the harm inflicted on Japan by its elderly.
The word, still lacking consensus on the parameters of its meaning, has been skulking around the national vocab for a few years now.
There is more to rougai than demographic concerns about an ageing population.
Those big, serious questions over whether Japan’s welfare systems and economy can adapt to its challenging demographics, or how elderly care will burden what remains of the labour force, have been prominent and perplexing for many years.
Rougai, meanwhile, is more granular: for some, it simply means “an annoying old person”.
A couple of books have tried to define the issue and positioned rougai as a series of micro-irritations and obstacles inflicted on working-age Japanese. But its usage has accelerated in recent months through repetition online and the way it handily encapsulates multiple problems.
Rougai, in the various mouths of its users, can be the stubborn idiocy of a senior executive who cannot use a computer but decries younger staff as inferior to previous generations. It is shoplifting sprees by retirees. It is superannuated politicians. It is elderly women hectoring young mothers in the street with unsolicited child-rearing advice. It is a snaking queue of septuagenarians dithering over touchscreen ticket machines. It is 90-year-olds causing pile-ups by driving their cars the wrong way up motorways.
When one major business magazine produced a top-10 list of rougai irritations in the workplace, it was topped by “the way old people always say they are right about everything”.
Another defined it in terms of the competitive drag suffered by so many Japanese companies whose elderly leaders refuse to step aside.
Rougai has become the go-to gripe when Japan’s old strike the young as infuriating, intractable and intolerable.
Generational friction is nothing new to humanity, nor special to Japan, but rougai seems to reflect a Japan-specific feeling that the young are being outnumbered by the old.
Government figures, the latest slew of which were released this month, confirm that exasperation.
A fifth of the population is now aged over 70, a third is over 60 and the direction of travel cannot be offset.
At the same time, most of the tensions created by rougai tend not to be socially explosive.
Respect for the elderly, whether by instinct or habit, generally ensures that its many manifestations are suffered in silence, pity or with an awkward laugh.
So how genuine is the rougai howl of age rage?
The lightning speed at which the Nagoya train door drama was both uploaded to social media and defined as rougai is instructive.
YouTube and other video-sharing sites are now groaning repositories for footage of elderly Japanese being awful, dangerous, or causing featherweight mayhem in public places, all searchable under rougai.
The internet is extremely efficient at assembling these encyclopedias of outrage and convincing viewers that the blight is both widespread and pernicious.
Japan, for its part, has a noble record when it comes to bashing-out a good neologism and encouraging people to see examples of it everywhere.
There is no doubt that the country’s demographics will confront its society with an ever more irritating, complex and saddening list of problems.
The burden of this will be immense and will surely fall most heavily on the generation that has shared and bemoaned the footage of the Nagoya door-stopper.
They know what trouble is coming; at least they have granted themselves the empowerment that comes with giving it a name.

Imagine the script of Downton Abbey, the lavish UK television period drama, tickled to launch subtle barbs at the administration of Theresa May and, say, her handling of Brexit.
Chinese costume dramas, equally lavish and likewise holding a nation in thrall, have added just such a layer of political piquancy to tales of intrigue and love in the Qing dynasty.
Several platforms held off airing episodes of the shows during the politically sensitive month of March, when political meetings are held.
The self-imposed moratorium reflects history’s troublesome tendency to hold a mirror up to the present, even centuries later.
Tales of dynastic emperors holding on to power, prompting revolts among those long-gone citizens, might be expected to chafe with a leader who has secured the ability to rule for life.
As one academic delicately puts it, “[The government] doesn’t want people to think that they have the opportunity to replace the leader or to struggle with the power base or change it. This kind of idea, if it circulates in the countryside or the cities, would be a little dangerous.”
Elaborate hairstyles, sumptuous silks and life at Qing dynasty court, meantime, betray a decadence and moral laxity that sits uneasily with “core socialist values”.
An editorial in the state-owned Beijing Daily railed against the imperial dramas’ proclivity to champion such pleasure-seeking above the “virtues of frugality and hard work”.
But you can’t keep a good story down.
With March safely out the way, at least some — such as The Legend of White Snake, a tale of love, heartbreak and destruction — are coming online.
The shows are lapped up by Chinese viewers.
The Story of Yanxi Palace, which ran to 70 episodes, became the most googled TV show last year and was shown in more than 80 countries — and this in a nation where Google’s search engine is blocked.
According to iQiyi, the Netflix-like platform that hosts the show, it was streamed an average 300m times a day and has been viewed more than 21bn times.
The secret sauce of the imperial dramas, says Lok-yin Law, lecturer at the School of Arts & Social Sciences at the Open University of Hong Kong （and husband of an avid fan）, is two-fold.
The stories resonate with everyday life, in the court or today’s workplace — back-stabbing is every bit as common in offices as it was in dynastic harems — and they revive the glory of Chinese culture.
The everyday appeal goes beyond bitchy colleagues.
Patriarchal power politics may be the reality, but Yanxi Palace boasts a female protagonist who is more conniving minx than demure doll, and has won legions of feminist fans.
As with British period dramas, historians carp that accuracy is sacrificed for ratings.
“It’s impossible an emperor in the Qing Dynasty, very busy dealing with politics and affairs of state . . . would have time to deal with so many concubines and negotiate among them,” says Song Geng, associate professor at Hong Kong university’s School of Chinese.
That highlights another schism: any educational purpose of TV shows is at odds with the profit motive of producers.
Dramas set in Imperial China — much like those based in Edwardian Britain or indeed the 1980s Texas of Dallas — go big on costumes, intrigue and wavering moral compasses.
They are less occupied with instructing the nation’s youth in history and moral rectitude.
That, of course, is ultimately where their appeal lies: as escapist dramas rooted just enough in the enduring traits of human nature to ensure growing audiences.
Several are finding popularity beyond China, particularly in Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Indeed, says Mr Law, he sees more chat about the shows in his Facebook social circles than among his friends on the mainland.
Hence the potential for the imperial dramas to become part of China’s soft power arsenal.
That its culture has failed to hold much global sway — compare the reach of South Korea’s K-pop or Japanese anime — is a source of dismay within China.
“It’s ridiculous that Kung Fu Panda was made by Hollywood,” harrumphs one analyst.
For Prof Song it’s a missed opportunity. “It could be . . . just like the K-wave,” he says. “For me this is good for China because it shows the influence of the culture.”

Stocks bounced back from their worst day in months on Tuesday as President Donald Trump reiterated China still wanted to ink a trade deal with the US, allaying some of the market’s fears over rising tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning, Mr Trump said “When the time is right we will make a deal with China”.
He went on to say a deal “will all happen, and much faster than people think!”.
However he also said while his “respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited”, any agreement must also “be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn’t make any sense.”
His slightly more optimistic remarks come after China hit back on Monday with its own retaliatory tariffs on about $60bn worth of US goods and sharply escalated the trade war between the two countries.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was up 1.4 per cent in mid-afternoon trade, recovering more than half of its 2.4 per cent drop on Monday, its biggest one-day fall since January.
The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.7 per cent, following its 3.4 per cent fall yesterday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 per cent.
While in hot demand amid Monday’s stock market sell-off, Treasuries cooled a touch on Tuesday, pushing yields higher.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury was up 1.6 basis points to 2.421 per cent from yesterday’s six-week low.
London’s FTSE 100 rose 1.1 per cent amid demand for its mining stocks.
Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax 30 added 1 per cent.
But pressure remained on Asian indices, where weakness continued into Tuesday after Beijing’s retaliation, although China’s currency also found support.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 1.5 per cent as traders caught up with the latest trade-related drama following a holiday on Monday.
China’s CSI 300 fell 0.6 per cent and Japan’s Topix was down 0.4 per cent.
China’s offshore renminbi suffered its  worst day since July on Monday, weakening more than 1 per cent against the dollar.
It was slightly  firmer against the dollar on Tuesday.
Donald Trump confirmed on Monday that he would meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at a G20 summit in Japan next month.
Some think markets could stay volatile in the meantime.
“Both sides have the incentive to act half-crazy and unpredictable before that in order to cut a better deal,” said Larry Hu, China economist at Macquarie Capital.

US equity markets reeled after China announced that it would raise tariffs on $60bn worth of US goods, hitting back after the Trump administration pushed ahead with new punitive duties on Chinese goods last week.
Beijing said on Monday that it would raise tariffs on a list of almost 2,500 goods to between 10 per cent and 25 per cent starting on June 1.
“China’s adjustment of tariff-adding measures is a response to US unilateralism and trade protectionism,” China’s Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
The tariff increase announced by Beijing on Monday would hit a broad range of sectors in the US, from heavy manufacturing and industry to agriculture and household goods.
The sharp escalation in the trade battle further eroded hopes of a quick resolution to US-China discussions and sent US share prices lower.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both down more than 2 per cent by mid-morning in New York, and global equities were eyeing their worst day of 2019.
The technology sector was particularly hard hit, with the S&P 500 sector falling 3.9 per cent in morning trading in New York.
The grouping includes Apple shares, which were 5.1 per cent lower, wiping more than $40bn from its market capitalisation.
Boeing dropped 3 per cent after a Chinese media report that Beijing could reduce orders from the manufacturer.
Soyabean futures were at their lowest point in more than 10 years in Chicago, sliding 2.1 per cent to $7.805 a bushel, while cotton — another major US agricultural export to China — fell 4.3 per cent to 65.5 cents a pound.
Treasury yields slipped as investors sought the safety of government bonds, putting the yield on benchmark 10-year US government debt at its lowest level since late March, down 4.1 basis points to 2.4139 per cent.
The rising tensions also knocked China’s currency and emerging market currencies more broadly.
The renminbi was down 0.9 per cent against the US dollar on offshore markets, having crossed the Rmb6.9 level for the first time this year.
The MSCI index tracking EM currencies was down 0.7 per cent, putting it on course for its biggest fall of 2019.
For 2,493 items on Beijing’s list — the bulk of the goods hit with the measures — tariffs would be increased by 25 per cent.
Those included agricultural items, such as frozen spinach and natural honey, and compounds such as potassium sulphate, commonly used in fertiliser, as well as various manufactured products such as LED lightbulbs.
On two other lists of 1,078 and 974 items, tariffs would be raised by 20 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.
Those lists included many household goods such as toothpaste and bleach along with many types of apparel and related manufacturing equipment, such as men’s swimming outfits and machinery that makes shoes.
A smaller list of 595 items would not see an increase beyond the present level of 5 per cent.
Among those items were a number of chemicals and industrial materials such as formaldehyde and lithium.
A range of electronic and motorised devices such as starters for the engines of cars, planes and boats, and 3D printers would also be spared an increase.
The response from Beijing came just three days after the Trump administration more than doubled levies on $200bn of Chinese goods to 25 per cent.
The US has threatened to hit a further $300bn of Chinese imports with the 25 per cent tariff rate if there is no progress in trade negotiations.
In response, China’s finance ministry said on Monday the tariff increase by the US “violates” an agreement between the two countries to resolve their trade differences through talks.
“In order to defend the multilateral trading system and defend its legitimate rights and interests, China has to adjust tariffs on some imported goods originating in the United States,” it added.
The White House and US trade representative did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding China’s retaliation.
It was not the first time that China has said it would increase tariffs on the list of US goods.
Last year, while facing earlier threats from the Trump administration, China said it planned to raise tariffs on $60bn in US exports to China.
Some experts expected China to push forward with the threat should it be hit with a new wave of tariffs from the US.
Earlier on Monday, President Donald Trump warned Beijing not to retaliate against the rise in tariffs his administration implemented last week and said China would be “hurt very badly” if it did not agree to a trade deal.
Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist for Invesco, said the increasingly dovish stance central banks led by the US Federal Reserve have taken this year after the dramatic drop in US stocks in December will cushion the fall for stocks.
“The two biggest risks facing markets right now are a trade war and a central banking mis-step to tighten too much. We have one of those risks out of the way, so that will limit the sell-off for stocks,” Ms Hooper said.

The US Supreme Court on Monday paved the way for a landmark antitrust lawsuit filed by iPhone owners who argued that Apple’s “walled garden” for apps is anti-competitive.
In a 5-4 decision authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the court said customers could sue Apple over the 30 per cent commission it charges developers who want to sell apps through its App Store.
The ruling may have far-reaching consequences for Apple, which bans customers from buying apps outside its App Store, and for other companies that operate online marketplaces.
Apple shares were down more than 5 per cent at midday in New York amid wider market weakness caused by the escalating trade war with China.
Mr Kavanaugh, a staunch conservative and recent appointee of President Donald Trump, joined with the liberals on the court to deliver what he called a “straightforward” ruling built on Apple’s direct relationship with its customers.
“The iPhone owners purchase apps directly from the retailer Apple, who is the alleged antitrust violator. The iPhone owners pay the alleged overcharge directly to Apple. The absence of an intermediary is dispositive,” he wrote in the court’s majority opinion.
In a statement, Apple said that the App Store was “not a monopoly by any metric”, adding: “We’re confident we will prevail when the facts are presented.”
Developers set prices in the App Store “and Apple has no role in that”, it said.
“Developers have a number of platforms to choose from to deliver their software — from other apps stores, to Smart TVs to gaming consoles — and we work hard every day to make our store the best, safest and most competitive in the world.”
The question before the court was whether iPhone owners could claim damages for alleged price inflation caused by a 30 per cent commission, even though the fee is levied upon developers, rather than consumers directly.
The case began as a class-action lawsuit filed in 2011.
The plaintiffs, led by Robert Pepper, argued that Apple had unlawfully monopolised the sale of iPhone apps by requiring customers to use its App Store.
The lawsuit was thrown out by a district court in California, but that decision was later reversed by the Ninth Circuit appeals court.
In 2017, Apple filed an appeal to the Supreme Court, asking it to block the lawsuit on the basis of a 1977 precedent set in a case called Illinois Brick, which said only the direct buyers of a product could seek triple damages for inflated prices under federal antitrust law.
The company had argued the precedent meant that in this case the plaintiffs should only be able to sue developers, who set the price of their individual apps, rather than Apple itself.
Mr Kavanaugh said Apple’s arguments were “not persuasive economically or legally”.
He wrote: “Apple’s theory would provide a road map for monopolistic retailers to structure transactions with manufacturers or suppliers so as to evade antitrust claims by consumers and thereby thwart effective antitrust enforcement.”

Over the past week economists have been dusting off forecasting models drawn up last year when US president Donald Trump first threatened to tax about half of all Chinese imports at 25 per cent.
Most analysts estimate that the latest tariffs, which were first scheduled to be imposed on January 1 but then delayed until last Friday, will have a significant impact on already slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy if fully implemented in about three weeks and not superseded by a trade agreement later this month or next.
But Chinese officials and experts continue to project confidence that their political and economic system will weather an all-out trade war better than the US.
After wrapping up a fruitless 11th round of formal trade talks in Washington last week, vice-premier Liu He vowed that neither his negotiating team nor the Chinese people would “flinch” in the face of higher US tariffs.
On Monday, China hit back at the US with additional tariffs on $60bn worth of US goods.
“I was just playing with my old model of trade war impacts,” said Bo Zhuang, chief China economist at TS Lombard.
According to Mr Zhuang’s estimates, the latest tariffs, if implemented for a full year, would reduce China’s exports to the US by $75bn — and by $170bn if Mr Trump follows through on his threat to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports.
The latter figure would be equivalent to one-third of the value of Chinese exports to the US in 2017, which amounted to $505bn, and translate into a 0.9 per cent decline in China’s nominal gross domestic product, according to Mr Zhuang’s estimates.
Over the first quarter of this year, merchandise trade between China and the US fell by $25bn over the same period in 2018, with Chinese exports to the US down 9 per cent, or $45bn in absolute dollar terms, and US exports to China down 30 per cent, or $39bn in absolute dollar terms.
“Owing to the sheer size of China’s economy and its declining reliance on exports, the immediate impact of the trade war on growth should be manageable,” Mr Zhuang predicted.
As a percentage of GDP, China’s total exports fell from 35 per cent in 2006 to 18 per cent in 2017, with exports to the US now equivalent to just 4 per cent of GDP.
Analysts at Moody’s project that if all Chinese exports to the US were taxed at 25 per cent for a full year, real GDP growth would slow by 1.2 percentage points to just over 5 per cent.
As unwelcome as this would be for President Xi Jinping and Mr Liu, who has simultaneously been leading a campaign against risky financial practices that has inadvertently starved private sector companies of capital, Chinese analysts argue that the party controls levers that Mr Trump can only dream of. While the US president struggles to get his favourite candidates appointed to the Federal Reserve board, the Communist party has direct leverage over everything from the renminbi’s dollar exchange rate to central bank monetary policy.
“China has its own ways to support exports, such as the exchange rate and tax rebates for exporters,” said Huang Weiping, an economics professor at Peking University.
He noted that as trade frictions with the US intensified last summer, the carefully managed renminbi fell almost 8 per cent against the dollar — nullifying much of the impact of Mr Trump’s initial tariffs.
On Monday, the renminbi fell as much as 0.5 per cent to Rmb6.87 per dollar and almost 1 per cent to Rmb6.94 per dollar in offshore trading.
Since Mr Trump first threatened to escalate the trade war on May 5, the renminbi has fallen 1.3 per cent against the dollar to a five-month low.
Chinese analysts say Mr Trump missed a golden opportunity to exert maximum pressure on China’s economy when he delayed implementing his tariff increase on January 1, and then again on March 1.
In mid-January, Mr Liu and Premier Li Keqiang were so worried about the private sector’s struggles that they made high-profile visits to the headquarters of each of China’s “big four” state banks, instructing them to lend more to small and medium-sized enterprises.
The People’s Bank of China has similarly tried to help the private sector by allowing banks to reduce their reserve levels on condition that the freed-up capital flows to SMEs.
By mid-March much of the gloom had lifted and China’s parliament rubber-stamped tax cuts and other stimulus measures worth Rmb2tn （$291bn）, helping to boost first-quarter GDP growth to a higher-than-forecast 6.4 per cent.
“The fourth quarter was the bottom of the economic cycle,” said one analyst at a government-affiliated think-tank who asked not to be named.
Other analysts agree.
“China has enough monetary and fiscal firepower to stimulate its economy and achieve its 6 per cent growth target even in the face of this external pressure,” Arthur Kroeber of Gavekal Research wrote in a research note on Monday.
Beijing’s strategy, he added, was “to play it cool and wait for an erosion of market and economic sentiment [in the US] to convince Trump that his political interests are best served by flipping back to dealmaker mode”.
The party, by contrast, has little to worry about in the way of criticism at home given its iron grip on China’s domestic media and internet, but is also aware that sentiment remains fragile and could sink again as the trade war enters a new phase.
As the government think-tank analyst said: “We have to report and get consent for interviews now.”

Gold gained on Monday as fears over a trade war deepened following China’s decision to place tariffs on $60bn worth of US goods.
Gold prices rose by 1 per cent to trade at $1,298 a troy ounce, just shy of the $1,300 barrier hit last month.
Gold has benefited from renewed trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies, rising by almost 2 per cent since President Donald Trump’s threat on May 4 to increase levies on $200bn of Chinese imports.
Gold is traditionally viewed as a safe haven investment that does well in times of market turmoil.
“It seems that the modest recovery we saw set in on Friday in a number of markets on the back of constructive ‘summation remarks’ following the end of the latest round of US/Chinese trade talks has fizzled in its entirety, leaving investors as confused as ever about the future course of events,” Edward Meir, an analyst at commodities brokerage INTL FCStone, said.
Industrial metals, however, were under pressure on Monday, with copper sinking to its lowest level since January on fears the trade spat will crimp demand in both the US and China.
Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange dropped 1.8 per cent to $6,030 a tonne, while zinc fell 2.6 per cent to $2,573 a tonne and nickel dipped 1.6 per cent to $11,765 a tonne.
Copper, widely regarded as a barometer of economic growth because of its wide range of uses in construction and manufacturing, has endured a miserable run over the past month, falling by almost 7 per cent. However, it remains in positive territory for the year.
Hedge funds and speculators have increased their bearish bets against the metal, which is still in positive territory for the year.
The net short position — the difference between bets on falling and rising prices — jumped by 173 per cent last week to a 14-week high of 27,000 lots.
“Buying opportunities will emerge — and we still like copper on a 6-12 month view — but near-term risk is now firmly skewed to the downside,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley.

Hedge funds betting on a China rebound have been delivering the kind of double-digit returns this year that most investors can only dream of.
Some fund managers are, however, starting to worry that the party may soon come to an end — spoiled by the deepening trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.
Funds betting on China have climbed 16.9 per cent this year, trouncing rivals in other markets, according to data group HFR.
London-based Marshall Wace, one of the world’s largest hedge funds with $39bn in assets, and Greenwoods Asset Management, a Shanghai-based outfit with $12bn of assets, are among those to reap big gains from Chinese share purchases.
The $2bn Golden China fund run by Greenwoods had surged 35 per cent in the year to early May, while Telligent Capital Management’s Greater China fund was up more than 20 per cent.
These strong performances reflect the recent rebound in China’s stock market, which quickly buried memories of last year, when it underperformed all other big markets.
Yet hedge fund managers are now nervously watching the trade dispute between the US and China as it casts a shadow over the outlook for Chinese corporate profits and starts to cause significant gyrations in global equity markets.
“It feels like the beginning of the year was almost a gift” for hedge funds, said Patrick Ghali, co-founder of Sussex Partners, which advises institutions on investing in hedge funds. However, he expects the US-China trade dispute to continue to weigh on economies and markets for years.
“This choppiness isn’t going to go away,” he said. “It’s becoming challenging for managers.”
Any confidence that the world’s two biggest economies would strike a trade deal was badly shaken last week, when US president Donald Trump raised tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods from 10 per cent to 25 per cent.
The unexpected move knocked high-flying Chinese stocks, unsettled Wall Street and shook major European markets.
China’s benchmark index, the CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed stocks, tumbled 5 per cent last week, cutting its gains for the year to slightly less than 24 per cent.
At Marshall Wace, this year’s gains for its Tops China fund — which stood at more than 41 per cent by early April — have fallen to 28 per cent, according to performance figures sent to investors.
The London-based group declined to comment.
As well as wrongfooting markets, last week’s salvo by the Trump administration triggered a series of gloomy forecasts for both the global economy and corporate earnings.
Economists at Barclays forecast the extra tariffs could trim Chinese gross domestic product by half a percentage point over the next year.
However, many hedge funds are still bullish on Chinese stocks, with some of them counting on the positive effects of Beijing further opening its financial markets to the rest of the world.
This trend has accelerated over the past year even as the White House sought to rewrite the US trade relationship with China.
The integration of Chinese stocks within global markets was given a fillip in March, when New York-based MSCI, the influential index provider, announced that the weighting of Chinese equities in its widely followed emerging markets benchmark would more than triple by November.
The move was expected to increase investment in Chinese stocks by passive funds.
“I don’t think that this will be the end of the equity market rally,” said Jennifer Wong, managing director of Pinpoint Asset Management, which is based in Hong Kong and runs $3.6bn in assets. “Capital flows have been fairly strong into the A-share [shares listed on mainland China] market until May. We don’t expect a big pullback in terms of capital flows.”
Pinpoint’s $1.25bn China fund has gained 10 per cent this year to early May while its smaller China Plus fund, which runs punchier bets, is up nearly 20 per cent.
Other funds remain confident that the US and China will eventually agree a truce on trade.
“Our base case is still very much that both countries need a deal — China needs a stable economy for it to push through further reforms while Donald Trump needs a political win to invigorate his re-election campaign which is just a few months away,” said Daniel Poon, managing director of Zeal Asset Management, a $1.2bn Hong Kong-based fund.
Zeal’s China fund was up about 11 per cent this year by early April but gains had slipped to about 9 per cent by early May, according to numbers sent to investors.
Some funds are starting to have second thoughts on the outlook for China. New York-based Key Square Capital Management, founded by Scott Bessent, the former chief investment officer of George Soros’s family office, has recently sold much of its China position, two people familiar with the matter said.
The managers of Key Square’s fund, which is up more than 8 per cent this year, have become concerned that the Chinese authorities are pulling back on monetary stimulus, one of the people said.
Mr Trump ratcheted up the level of concern among investors late on Friday by instructing Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, to start preparing tariffs on a further $300bn of Chinese goods.
Trying to navigate the fallout from the US-China trade war looks set to be the biggest challenge for hedge funds as they strive to maintain their positive start to 2019 and bounce back from the 4.8 per cent losses the overall industry suffered last year.

China has struck back at US accusations that it reneged on trade commitments, saying it was Washington that repeatedly tried to change the terms of the negotiations midway through the talks.
In its first detailed explanation of the failure of the discussions, China’s foreign ministry on Tuesday accused Washington of trying to force Beijing to suddenly increase the volume of goods it was willing to buy from the US as part of an agreement, violating terms struck in December.
The US “arbitrarily raised its asking price”, said a spokesman for the foreign ministry.
“The hat that . . . violates promises is absolutely not on the Chinese head.”
Washington launched the latest salvo in the dispute on Friday when it increased duties on $200bn of Chinese imports to 25 per cent and later set in motion a plan to do the same with a further $300bn of goods.
China responded by announcing on Monday it would impose tariffs on $60bn of US imports starting on June 1, sending stocks in the US sharply lower on Monday with the Asia-Pacific indices following suit a day later.
Beijing followed up with a barrage of nationalist commentary on official media designed to shore up support at home for a protracted battle with Washington.
A fiery dispatch on state broadcaster CCTV’s evening news programme went viral on Weibo, China’s largest social media platform, on Monday night and a hashtag for the clip had been viewed more than 3bn times.
“After 5,000 years of trials and tribulations, what kind of battle have the Chinese people not been through?” said Kang Hui, a news reader.
“The US-started trade war against China is not more than an important unifying juncture in China’s development. There’s nothing to worry about. China must stand firm, be confident and rise through hardships.”
The foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing on Tuesday said the US had reneged on a joint consensus last May.

The US is determined to choke off external funding to Iran because we want to prevent it from financing missile development, fomenting regional conflicts and funding terrorist networks.
Much of Iran’s money comes from metal exports, including $4.2bn from the sale of steel — a 53 per cent increase from 2017 — and a further $917m from copper and its downstream products.
The country is on schedule to become a net exporter of aluminium by the end of the year.
That is why US President Donald Trump signed a tough new executive order last week, extending existing sanctions to include Iranian aluminium, copper, iron and steel.
Without such sanctions, Iran’s steel export revenues will increase significantly.
As part of its ambitious 2025 Vision Plan, Iran seeks to become the world’s sixth-largest steelmaker as capacity is projected to almost double, from 31m metric tonnes in 2017 to 55m by 2025.
Iran also has three greenfield primary aluminium smelters either under construction or recently completed. The Salco smelter in Asaluyeh is the largest. It is due to come online this year and will add nearly 300,000 tonnes of production. The project includes a deepwater port located near the facility in southern Iran — an indication that the smelter will export the majority of the aluminium it produces.
Most, if not all, of Iran’s export revenues from the metals trade flow right into government coffers.
The country’s top three steel producers are all state-owned and account for more than 50 per cent of production.
An emerging aluminium industry is entirely state-owned, growing rapidly and was projected to be a net exporter this year.
Iran’s top steel export markets currently include Indonesia, Thailand, Iraq, Turkey, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Taiwan and Egypt.
The new sanctions should turn the flow of Iranian metals to these markets into a trickle as America’s partners and allies respond to the higher risks of sourcing materials from Iran and seek out more reliable, alternative sources of supply that do not fund terror with the proceeds.
The proposed sanctions should curtail any attempts by Iran to “trans-ship” steel and other metals into the US through third-party countries — a scheme that undermines the pre-existing steel and aluminium tariffs the president has imposed for national security reasons.
These new sanctions will also send a clear signal that China may pay a heavy price if it continues to support rogue regimes, including Iran.
Historically, China has provided Iranian steel producers with much of the investment, equipment and strategic advice necessary to expand its industry.
To take just one recent example, the state-owned Chinese Metallurgical Group Corporation intends to finance a significant share of Iran’s steel capacity expansion.
A similar situation exists with aluminium.
The aforementioned $1.2bn Salco-Asalouyeh smelting facility was funded by the state-managed Chinese Nonferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Company.
The country is also in talks to build a 2m-tonne alumina refinery to support the sector’s expansion.
Here’s the bottom line: the Trump administration’s latest sanctions on Iran’s metals exports will help to further constrict the ability of Iran to develop missiles, spread radical Islam and mayhem in the region and support terrorist networks.
The countries and companies that are currently helping to finance Iran’s rogue behaviour through the metals trade have been put on notice that the price of such trade has just become a lot steeper.
As buyers, they should beware that there will be zero tolerance for violations of Iranian sanctions in future.

Shares in US and European automakers were crushed on Monday after China announced plans to impose higher tariffs of its own, further escalating tensions with the US amid trade negotiations.
The Stoxx 600 automobile and parts index was the top laggard in the Europe-wide gauge, sliding 2.7 per cent.
Automakers with exposure to China suffered some of the heaviest losses.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler, two of the largest exporters of US vehicles to China, sank 1.5 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively.
In the US, Fiat Chrysler — which exports US-made Jeeps to China — led declines among the major car manufacturers with a decline of 2.9 per cent.
General Motors, the largest US automaker, counts China among its top markets by sales, although it makes most of the vehicles it sells there locally.
Shares in the company fell 2.7 per cent.
Tesla, which ships electric vehicles from its California factory to China, was down 5.9 per cent.
The Dow Jones US Automobiles and Parts Index took a 3.6 per cent hit.
In addition to automakers such as GM, motorcycle builder Harley-Davidson, tire maker Goodyear and parts suppliers including Visteon and BorgWarner dragged the index lower.
China announced it will raise import duties on about $60bn worth of US goods beginning June 1.
The move came after President Donald Trump increased tariffs on $200bn in Chinese imports on Friday, as US officials accused Beijing of “reneging” on pledges made during trade negotiations.
The fresh exchange of tariffs has stoked concerns the talks may break down, spooking investors around the globe.
After Mr Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping agreed to a trade truce in December, Beijing lowered its tariffs on American-made cars to 15 per cent from 40 per cent.

President Donald Trump decided to pull the trigger on higher tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports last Friday （with China retaliating today）, and it is not just in Washington and Beijing where the implications are getting full attention.
Over the past 28 months since Mr Trump took office, economic diplomats and officials around the world have been struggling to manage trade relations with the US administration, and the escalation against China has raised fears that they could be next in line.
Hawks inside and outside the administration are clearly in the ascent when it comes to trade policy.
The fear is that the White House could expand its more aggressive stance to other targets, even at the expense of America’s closest allies and the multilateral trading system.
Until now the hope has been that Mr Trump likes to make threats to gain leverage in negotiations, but is willing to push the envelope only so far.
Many thought that 25 per cent tariffs on China were too risky — even for Mr Trump — and they will now be recalibrating their expectations with regards to other trade battles.
Here are the three main areas to watch.
Each outlines worst-case scenarios, which cannot be ruled out.
1. Car tariffs
Mr Trump will have to decide on Thursday what to do with a report from the commerce department that has not been released publicly, but which is expected to say that automotive imports are a national security risk to the US — giving him a legal basis to hit them with tariffs.
That possibility has raised deep concerns mainly in the EU, Japan and South Korea, whose carmakers would be hardest hit.
The assumption has been that the economic impact of such a move would be so severe that the US president would not pursue it （there is very little political support for car tariffs in America）.
Mr Trump could open negotiations with foreign capitals over the issue, extending the timeframe for a decision by six months.
But a more aggressive step would be to impose the tariffs and suspend them temporarily, leaving Tokyo, Brussels and Seoul with a sword of Damocles over their head.
The nuclear option of moving immediately to car tariffs would be unexpected even now, but can no longer be ruled out.
2. Dropping Nafta
With great fanfare on the margins of the G20 summit in Argentina, Mr Trump signed the revised Nafta — the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA — with Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, and Enrique Peña Nieto, then president of Mexico.
But Mr Trump is facing trouble getting his legislative accomplishment through Congress, because of resistance from congressional Democrats and some Republicans.
Normally, he might be expected to address Capitol Hill’s reservations, including, in this case, demands that he lift steel and aluminium tariffs on America’s neighbours.
But the latest turn of events with China will raise fears that he will be much more brazen and threaten a costly US withdrawal from the existing Nafta if he fails to get his way.
3. Ditching the WTO
It has been a while since Mr Trump said the US should pull out of the World Trade Organization, but the downward turn of the China negotiations could revive that possibility.
In a world of escalating tariffs and fewer restraints on Beijing, the WTO could be an ideal forum to get the globe’s two largest economies talking again and playing by the rules.
But the US is unlikely to see it that way.
Instead, Mr Trump will probably view the WTO as an impediment to his ability to wage commercial warfare against China, and, rather than calling for reform of the Geneva-based body, the US may simply decide to remove its support entirely.

No one wins from trade protectionism and the return of Tariff Man, and retaliatory measures from Beijing will only exacerbate what was already shaping up as a testing period for financial markets and investment portfolios.
Equity markets began May showing signs of fatigue after a powerful rebound in recent months.
That’s hardly surprising given that asset prices need to see stronger evidence of a resilient global economy, thereby signalling the current cycle has room to run longer.
That now looks a far tougher challenge after the US jacked up tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports on Friday, a move foreshadowed by President Donald Trump last Sunday who duly rattled financial markets this week. An escalating trade war after a hiatus of several months takes us back to the final quarter of 2018, when markets approached the brink, only for central banks to come riding to the rescue.
A growing risk is that Mr Trump won’t just stop with this latest escalation.
There’s the threat of extending US tariffs to all Chinese imports and Washington trade hawks are circling Japan and eyeing Germany and the wider eurozone.
The prospect of a further hit to international trade comes at a time when the global economy needs all the help it can get.
Over the past year the cost from US and Chinese tariffs has been accompanied by stalling trade flows and left its mark on the global economy, notably for China, Japan and Europe.
But a moderating pace of US growth from last year’s stimulus-fuelled heights also leaves its economy vulnerable to trade stress beyond the already suffering agricultural sector.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500’s dominant and most profitable sector, technology, faces a challenge given that more than half of its sales are generated outside the US, by far the highest of any major industry in the index.
For investors, the two big macro concerns framing their risk allocation decisions for 2019 and beyond is whether China’s stimulus flows into the global economy, and have central banks done enough to support a rebound in activity after their new year policy pivots.
Further trade protectionism leaves the global economy, together with elevated asset prices and a massive rise in debt over the past decade, looking ever so vulnerable as the recession clock ticks a little louder.
Among investors and strategists there is a view that, for all the political posturing, it serves the interests of both the US and China to avoid a game of chicken over trade.
Others take comfort that, so long as the US and China keep talking, the path is open towards an agreement.
Expectations of an eventual agreement help explain the limited weakness in global equities this week.
But the debate over who has the stronger hand at this poker table, and hopes of a “beautiful” trade agreement, misses a far more important point.
Tariffs are likely to stay as the struggle for dominance between the world’s two largest economies runs well into the next decade.
Any treaty on trade that eventually emerges will probably not pass enforcement over time.
Moreover, Mr Trump and US trade hawks have plenty of company across party lines.
Heading into the 2020 election cycle, being “tough on China” is seen as a vote winner.
A more troubling long-term view for investors is the onset of a more profound change.
After several decades of globalisation — an era where companies have created complex supply chains for goods, services, staff and capital — the lights are dimming.
True, supply chains will probably shift from China to other countries, but the disengagement between Beijing and Washington has broader repercussions.
Alan Ruskin at Deutsche Bank says this entails less US foreign direct investment into China, while Beijing will seek to avoid enlarging its already massive holdings of US dollar-denominated assets.
One of Mr Trump’s troubling legacies is far larger federal debt, with the red ink rising relentlessly over the coming decade.
The likely scenario of weaker growth and the risk of a recession within the next few years will only exacerbate the pressure on US finances and hit the value of the dollar and the Treasury debt market.
As the largest foreign holder of Treasury debt, China is not going to spark a meltdown by dumping its holdings.
But, over time, Beijing’s steady running down of its US assets looms as a slow-burn retaliatory measure that will resonate, particularly when the dollar weakens and Wall Street looks out at a world where China and other US trading partners recycle far less of their reserves across the Pacific.

European powers warned the US and Iran against igniting a conflict “by accident” as tensions in the Gulf rose following an attack on two Saudi oil tankers.
Jeremy Hunt, the British foreign secretary, issued the warning as Mike Pompeo, Washington’s top diplomat, met separately the foreign ministers of Germany, France and the UK in Brussels on Monday.
The meeting took place amid European concerns over the US stand-off with Iran and the future of the 2015 nuclear deal Tehran signed with world powers.
Mr Pompeo paid the surprise visit to the Belgian capital en route to Russia for what Sergei Lavrov, the country’s foreign minister, said would probably be a “frank talk” on US Iran policy.
The European ministers tried to calm tensions stoked by Washington’s plans for further military deployments in the Middle East and Iran’s announcement last week that it would no longer comply with important elements of its nuclear deal.
Mr Hunt said the UK was “very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident with an escalation that is unintended really on either side”.
“What we need is a period of calm to make sure that everyone understands what the other side is thinking,” Mr Hunt told reporters.
“And most of all, we need to make sure we don’t end up putting Iran back on the path to re-nuclearisation . . . This would be a massive step in the wrong direction.”
Heiko Maas, Germany’s foreign minister, echoed calls for cool heads after Iran demanded the Europeans and fellow nuclear accord signatories Russia and China make up economic benefits lost when the US reimposed sanctions as part of its campaign of “maximum pressure” on Tehran.
Under the atomic agreement, Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of many international sanctions.

Bitcoin was hovering above $7,000 on Monday after climbing to a nine-month high over the weekend.
The cryptocurrency jumped to $7,585 on Sunday, its highest level since August, according to Refinitiv data based on the Bitstamp exchange.
Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalisation was down 2.6 per cent over the past 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap
Bitcoin recorded a strong performance last week, rising 22 per cent. That reignited suggestions from the cryptocurrency community that the digital asset acts as a haven in times of uncertainty, as stock markets pulled back on heightened US-China trade tensions.
Bitcoin has surged by more than 90 per cent since the start of 2019, but remains short of its all-time high seen at the end of 2017 when it climbed above $19,000.
